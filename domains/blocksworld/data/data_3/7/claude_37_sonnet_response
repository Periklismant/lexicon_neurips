Let's first understand the current state of the world:
- white_block_1 is on the table
- purple_block_1 is on the table
- blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_1
- red_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1
- grey_block_1 is on the table
- white_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1
- blue_block_2 is on top of white_block_2
- red_block_1 is clear
- grey_block_1 is clear
- blue_block_2 is clear
- the arm is not holding any block

The goal is to have blue_block_2 on the table.

Looking at the current state, blue_block_2 is on top of white_block_2, which is on top of blue_block_1, which is on top of white_block_1, which is on the table. So to get blue_block_2 on the table, we need to move blue_block_2 from the top of white_block_2 to the table. But to do that, we need to consider the constraints.

Let's analyze the constraints:

1. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'red_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1'"
   - In the current state, red_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1, not on white_block_1, so this constraint is already satisfied.

2. "If expression 'red_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1' holds in some state s, then expression 'white_block_2 is on the table' must hold at s or at some state after s"
   - Since the first part of this constraint is already satisfied, we need to ensure that at some point, we have white_block_2 on the table.

3. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'grey_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1'"
   - In the current state, grey_block_1 is on the table, not on top of white_block_1, so this constraint is already satisfied.

4. "If expression 'grey_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1' holds in some state s, then expression 'there is a block on top of red_block_1, i.e., red_block_1 is not clear' must hold at s or at some state after s"
   - Since the first part of this constraint is already satisfied, we need to ensure that at some point, red_block_1 is not clear.

5. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'blue_block_1 is not on the table'"
   - In the current state, blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_1, not on the table, so this constraint is already satisfied.

6. "If expression 'blue_block_1 is not on the table' holds in some state s, then expression 'purple_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1' must hold at s or at some state after s"
   - Since the first part of this constraint is already satisfied, we need to ensure that at some point, purple_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1.

So, in summary, the constraints require us to ensure the following at some point:
- white_block_2 is on the table
- red_block_1 is not clear
- purple_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1

Let me plan a sequence of actions to satisfy the goal and constraints:

Starting state:
- Tower 1: white_block_1, blue_block_1, white_block_2, blue_block_2
- Tower 2: purple_block_1, red_block_1
- Tower 3: grey_block_1

To achieve the goal "blue_block_2 is on the table", we need to manipulate Tower 1. However, we also need to satisfy the constraints:
- At some point, white_block_2 must be on the table.
- At some point, red_block_1 must not be clear.
- At some point, purple_block_1 must be on top of grey_block_1.

Let's plan the steps:

1. First, let's unstack blue_block_2 from white_block_2.
   - Action: unstack blue_block_2 white_block_2
   - State: Arm holding blue_block_2, white_block_2 is clear.

2. Now, let's place blue_block_2 on the table.
   - Action: putdown blue_block_2
   - State: blue_block_2 on the table, arm is free.

At this point, we've already achieved our main goal: blue_block_2 is on the table. However, we still need to satisfy the constraints.

3. To satisfy "white_block_2 is on the table", let's unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_1.
   - Action: unstack white_block_2 blue_block_1
   - State: Arm holding white_block_2, blue_block_1 is clear.

4. Then, let's place white_block_2 on the table.
   - Action: putdown white_block_2
   - State: white_block_2 on the table, arm is free.

Now, we've satisfied the constraint that white_block_2 must be on the table at some point.

5. To satisfy "red_block_1 is not clear", we need to place something on top of red_block_1. Let's unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1.
   - Action: unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1
   - State: Arm holding blue_block_1, white_block_1 is clear.

6. Then, let's stack blue_block_1 on red_block_1.
   - Action: stack blue_block_1 red_block_1
   - State: blue_block_1 on top of red_block_1, arm is free.

Now, we've satisfied the constraint that red_block_1 must not be clear at some point.

7. Finally, to satisfy "purple_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1", we need to unstack red_block_1 from purple_block_1 first.
   - Action: unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1
   - State: Arm holding red_block_1, purple_block_1 is clear.

But wait, we've already placed blue_block_1 on top of red_block_1 in step 6. We can't unstack red_block_1 if there's something on top of it. Let's revise the plan.

Revised plan:

1. First, unstack blue_block_2 from white_block_2.
   - Action: unstack blue_block_2 white_block_2
   - State: Arm holding blue_block_2, white_block_2 is clear.

2. Place blue_block_2 on the table.
   - Action: putdown blue_block_2
   - State: blue_block_2 on the table, arm is free.

Now, our goal "blue_block_2 is on the table" is achieved, but we still need to satisfy the constraints.

3. Unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_1.
   - Action: unstack white_block_2 blue_block_1
   - State: Arm holding white_block_2, blue_block_1 is clear.

4. Place white_block_2 on the table.
   - Action: putdown white_block_2
   - State: white_block_2 on the table, arm is free.

Now, the constraint "white_block_2 is on the table" is satisfied.

5. Unstack red_block_1 from purple_block_1.
   - Action: unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1
   - State: Arm holding red_block_1, purple_block_1 is clear.

6. Place red_block_1 on the table.
   - Action: putdown red_block_1
   - State: red_block_1 on the table, arm is free.

7. Stack unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1.
   - Action: unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1
   - State: Arm holding blue_block_1, white_block_1 is clear.

8. Stack blue_block_1 on red_block_1.
   - Action: stack blue_block_1 red_block_1
   - State: blue_block_1 on top of red_block_1, arm is free.

Now, the constraint "red_block_1 is not clear" is satisfied.

9. Stack purple_block_1 on grey_block_1.
   - Action: pickup purple_block_1
   - State: Arm holding purple_block_1, grey_block_1 is clear.

10. Stack purple_block_1 on grey_block_1.
   - Action: stack purple_block_1 grey_block_1
   - State: purple_block_1 on top of grey_block_1, arm is free.

Now, the constraint "purple_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1" is satisfied.

Actually, let me be a bit more careful here and re-think through all the constraints to makes sure I'm satisfying them:

1. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'red_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1'"
   - This is already true in the initial state, as red_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1.

2. "If expression 'red_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1' holds in some state s, then expression 'white_block_2 is on the table' must hold at s or at some state after s"
   - Since 'red_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1' holds in the initial state, 'white_block_2 is on the table' must hold at some state during our plan. Our plan ensures white_block_2 is on the table at step 4.

3. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'grey_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1'"
   - This is already true in the initial state, as grey_block_1 is on the table.

4. "If expression 'grey_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1' holds in some state s, then expression 'there is a block on top of red_block_1, i.e., red_block_1 is not clear' must hold at s or at some state after s"
   - Since 'grey_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1' holds in the initial state, 'red_block_1 is not clear' must hold at some state during our plan. Our plan ensures red_block_1 is not clear at step 8.

5. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'blue_block_1 is not on the table'"
   - This is already true in the initial state, as blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_1.

6. "If expression 'blue_block_1 is not on the table' holds in some state s, then expression 'purple_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1' must hold at s or at some state after s"
   - Since 'blue_block_1 is not on the table' holds in the initial state, 'purple_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1' must hold at some state during our plan. Our plan ensures purple_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1 at step 10.

So our final plan looks like this:

1. unstack blue_block_2 white_block_2
2. putdown blue_block_2
3. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_1
4. putdown white_block_2
5. unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1
6. putdown red_block_1
7. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1
8. stack blue_block_1 red_block_1
9. pickup purple_block_1
10. stack purple_block_1 grey_block_1

However, I think there is an issue with step 10. Let's check:

Step 9: Arm holding purple_block_1, grey_block_1 is clear, purple_block_1 is no longer on the table.

Step 10: purple_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1, grey_block_1 is not clear, arm is free.

That seems fine. Let's double-check the entire plan:

1. unstack blue_block_2 white_block_2
   - Preconditions: blue_block_2 is on top of white_block_2, blue_block_2 is clear, arm is free.
   - Effects: Arm holding blue_block_2, white_block_2 is clear, blue_block_2 is no longer on top of white_block_2.

2. putdown blue_block_2
   - Preconditions: Arm holding blue_block_2.
   - Effects: blue_block_2 on the table, blue_block_2 is clear, arm is free.

3. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_1
   - Preconditions: white_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1, white_block_2 is clear, arm is free.
   - Effects: Arm holding white_block_2, blue_block_1 is clear, white_block_2 is no longer on top of blue_block_1.

4. putdown white_block_2
   - Preconditions: Arm holding white_block_2.
   - Effects: white_block_2 on the table, white_block_2 is clear, arm is free.

5. unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1
   - Preconditions: red_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1, red_block_1 is clear, arm is free.
   - Effects: Arm holding red_block_1, purple_block_1 is clear, red_block_1 is no longer on top of purple_block_1.

6. putdown red_block_1
   - Preconditions: Arm holding red_block_1.
   - Effects: red_block_1 on the table, red_block_1 is clear, arm is free.

7. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1
   - Preconditions: blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_1, blue_block_1 is clear, arm is free.
   - Effects: Arm holding blue_block_1, white_block_1 is clear, blue_block_1 is no longer on top of white_block_1.

8. stack blue_block_1 red_block_1
   - Preconditions: Arm holding blue_block_1, red_block_1 is clear.
   - Effects: blue_block_1 on top of red_block_1, blue_block_1 is clear, red_block_1 is not clear, arm is free.

9. pickup purple_block_1
   - Preconditions: purple_block_1 is on the table, purple_block_1 is clear, arm is free.
   - Effects: Arm holding purple_block_1, purple_block_1 is no longer on the table.

10. stack purple_block_1 grey_block_1
    - Preconditions: Arm holding purple_block_1, grey_block_1 is clear.
    - Effects: purple_block_1 on top of grey_block_1, purple_block_1 is clear, grey_block_1 is not clear, arm is free.

Everything seems to be correct, and the plan satisfies the goal and all constraints. So the final plan is:

1. unstack blue_block_2 white_block_2
2. putdown blue_block_2
3. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_1
4. putdown white_block_2
5. unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1
6. putdown red_block_1
7. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1
8. stack blue_block_1 red_block_1
9. pickup purple_block_1
10. stack purple_block_1 grey_block_1

But let's do a final check to minimize the plan. The given goal is just to ensure that blue_block_2 is on the table. The other constraints are just conditions that should be satisfied at some point during the plan. So the optimal plan would be one that minimizes the number of actions while ensuring that the goal and all constraints are met.

The goal is achieved at step 2. The constraints are satisfied at steps 4, 8, and 10. Since all constraints need to be satisfied, the minimum length of the plan would be 10 steps. However, it's important to ensure that our plan is indeed the optimal one.

Let's check if there's a shorter plan:

We need to ensure:
1. blue_block_2 is on the table (goal)
2. white_block_2 is on the table at some point
3. red_block_1 is not clear at some point
4. purple_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1 at some point

Given the initial state, we need to move blocks around to satisfy these. The goal is achieved by removing blue_block_2 from the tower and placing it on the table, which takes 2 actions. To ensure white_block_2 is on the table, we need to remove it from the tower, which takes another 2 actions (after blue_block_2 is removed). The other two constraints require moving other blocks, which will indeed take additional actions. So, the total would be at least 8-10 actions, as we've planned.

I believe our plan is close to optimal, if not the optimal one.

Actually, let me just think about this one more time to make sure the plan is correct. I think there was a bit of a misunderstanding on my part.

Let's review the constraints:

1. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'red_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1'"
   - In the initial state, red_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1, not on white_block_1. So this constraint is already satisfied. However, the implication is that "red_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" should hold at some point, but it doesn't necessarily have to be the case in the initial state.

2. "If expression 'red_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1' holds in some state s, then expression 'white_block_2 is on the table' must hold at s or at some state after s"
   - Since the first part holds in the initial state, 'white_block_2 is on the table' must be true at some point during or after the initial state. Our plan ensures this at step 4.

3. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'grey_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1'"
   - In the initial state, grey_block_1 is on the table, not on white_block_1. So this constraint is already satisfied. Again, the implication is that "grey_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" should be true at some point.

4. "If expression 'grey_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1' holds in some state s, then expression 'there is a block on top of red_block_1, i.e., red_block_1 is not clear' must hold at s or at some state after s"
   - Since the first part holds in the initial state, 'red_block_1 is not clear' must be true at some point during or after the initial state. Our plan ensures this at step 8.

5. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'blue_block_1 is not on the table'"
   - In the initial state, blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_1, not on the table. So this constraint is already satisfied. Again, the implication is that "blue_block_1 is not on the table" should be true at some point.

6. "If expression 'blue_block_1 is not on the table' holds in some state s, then expression 'purple_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1' must hold at s or at some state after s"
   - Since the first part holds in the initial state, 'purple_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1' must be true at some point during or after the initial state. Our plan ensures this at step 10.

Ah, I see. The constraints start being applicable from the initial state. If a condition is already true in the initial state, then the consequent of the if-then constraint must be satisfied at some point during or after the initial state.

I think my analysis above is correct:
1. All three "must hold in at least one state" constraints are already true in the initial state.
2. For each of the if-then constraints, the condition is true in the initial state, so the consequent must be true at some point during or after the initial state. Our plan ensures this.

So, our plan is correct and should be optimal. Here it is one more time:

1. unstack blue_block_2 white_block_2
2. putdown blue_block_2
3. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_1
4. putdown white_block_2
5. unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1
6. putdown red_block_1
7. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1
8. stack blue_block_1 red_block_1
9. pickup purple_block_1
10. stack purple_block_1 grey_block_1

Actually now that I think about it, I'm missing a crucial understanding of the constraints. Let's revisit the problem and read the constraints more carefully...

The constraints are as follows:

1. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'red_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1'"
   - This specifies that at some point during the plan, red_block_1 should not be on top of white_block_1.
   - In the initial state, red_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1, not on white_block_1. Thus, this constraint is already satisfied from the start.

2. "If expression 'red_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1' holds in some state s, then expression 'white_block_2 is on the table' must hold at s or at some state after s"
   - Since 'red_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1' holds in the initial state, 'white_block_2 is on the table' must be true at some state during the plan.
   - In the initial state, white_block_2 is on top of blue_block_1. Our plan ensures white_block_2 is on the table at step 4.

3. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'grey_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1'"
   - This specifies that at some point during the plan, grey_block_1 should not be on top of white_block_1.
   - In the initial state, grey_block_1 is on the table, not on white_block_1. Thus, this constraint is already satisfied from the start.

4. "If expression 'grey_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1' holds in some state s, then expression 'there is a block on top of red_block_1, i.e., red_block_1 is not clear' must hold at s or at some state after s"
   - Since 'grey_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1' holds in the initial state, 'red_block_1 is not clear' must be true at some state during the plan.
   - In the initial state, red_block_1 is clear. Our plan ensures red_block_1 is not clear at step 8.

5. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'blue_block_1 is not on the table'"
   - This specifies that at some point during the plan, blue_block_1 should not be on the table.
   - In the initial state, blue_block_1 is on top of white_block_1, not on the table. Thus, this constraint is already satisfied from the start.

6. "If expression 'blue_block_1 is not on the table' holds in some state s, then expression 'purple_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1' must hold at s or at some state after s"
   - Since 'blue_block_1 is not on the table' holds in the initial state, 'purple_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1' must be true at some state during the plan.
   - In the initial state, purple_block_1 is on the table. Our plan ensures purple_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1 at step 10.

Yes, it seems the constraints are already applicable from the initial state. And since the conditions of the if-then constraints are true in the initial state, the consequents must be satisfied at some point during the plan. Our plan ensures all of these are satisfied.

So, our plan should be correct and optimal. Here it is one final time:

1. unstack blue_block_2 white_block_2
2. putdown blue_block_2
3. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_1
4. putdown white_block_2
5. unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1
6. putdown red_block_1
7. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1
8. stack blue_block_1 red_block_1
9. pickup purple_block_1
10. stack purple_block_1 grey_block_1

But wait! Can this be more optimal?

As I mentioned earlier, since we have the goal "blue_block_2 is on the table" and it's achieved at step 2, we need to keep the rest of the plan to satisfy the if-then constraints.

Let's think if we're missing something. The condition parts of all the if-then constraints are already true in the initial state. This means that the consequent parts must be true at some point during the plan. The consequents are:
1. white_block_2 is on the table
2. red_block_1 is not clear
3. purple_block_1 is on top of grey_block_1

We can check if there's a more efficient way to make these true.

For white_block_2 to be on the table, we need to:
1. unstack blue_block_2 white_block_2
2. putdown blue_block_2 (this also achieves our main goal)
3. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_1
4. putdown white_block_2

For red_block_1 to be not clear, we need to place something on top of it. The most direct way (given we need to manipulate blocks anyway) is to:
5. unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1
6. putdown red_block_1
7. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1
8. stack blue_block_1 red_block_1

For purple_block_1 to be on top of grey_block_1, we need to:
9. pickup purple_block_1
10. stack purple_block_1 grey_block_1

It seems like 10 steps is the minimum, given the goal and the constraints.

Actually, let me just think one more time to see if there are any optimizations we can make. The key optimizations would come from reusing blocks for different purposes or ensuring that we don't undo our own progress.

For instance, when we unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1, can we directly stack it on grey_block_1 rather than red_block_1? This would reduce steps by making purple_block_1 unnecessary for satisfying the constraints. But then, we wouldn't satisfy the constraint that red_block_1 should not be clear at some point.

I'm now convinced that the plan is optimal. Here it is:

1. unstack blue_block_2 white_block_2
2. putdown blue_block_2
3. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_1
4. putdown white_block_2
5. unstack red_block_1 purple_block_1
6. putdown red_block_1
7. unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1
8. stack blue_block_1 red_block_1
9. pickup purple_block_1
10. stack purple_block_1 grey_block_1
