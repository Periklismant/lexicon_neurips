Let's analyze this problem carefully.

We have 7 blocks: orange_block_1, white_block_1, red_block_1, orange_block_2, black_block_1, green_block_1, and red_block_2.

The initial state is:
- orange_block_1 is on the table
- white_block_1 is on the table
- red_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1
- orange_block_2 is on top of white_block_1
- black_block_1 is on top of red_block_1
- green_block_1 is on top of orange_block_2
- red_block_2 is on the table
- black_block_1 is clear
- green_block_1 is clear
- red_block_2 is clear
- the arm is not holding any block

The goal is to have orange_block_2 on top of black_block_1.

The constraints are:
1. black_block_1 is not on the table in at least one state
2. If black_block_1 is not on the table, then red_block_1 is clear in that state or a later state
3. white_block_1 is clear in at least one state
4. If white_block_1 is clear, then orange_block_1 was clear in an earlier state
5. orange_block_1 is held by the arm in at least one state

Let's visualize the initial state:

```
     green_block_1
           |
     orange_block_2      black_block_1
           |                   |
     white_block_1       red_block_1    red_block_2
           |                   |
        table           orange_block_1
                              |
                           table
```

And the goal state is to have orange_block_2 on top of black_block_1, i.e.:

```
     orange_block_2
           |
     black_block_1
           |
      red_block_1
           |
     orange_block_1
           |
        table
```

To satisfy the constraints:
1. black_block_1 is not on the table: This is satisfied in the initial state, as black_block_1 is on top of red_block_1.
2. If black_block_1 is not on the table, then red_block_1 is clear in that state or a later state: In the initial state, black_block_1 is not on the table, but red_block_1 is not clear. We need to ensure that red_block_1 becomes clear at some point after or during the time black_block_1 is not on the table.
3. white_block_1 is clear in at least one state: In the initial state, white_block_1 is not clear (as orange_block_2 is on top of it). We need to make sure white_block_1 becomes clear at some point.
4. If white_block_1 is clear, then orange_block_1 was clear in an earlier state: This means we need to ensure orange_block_1 is clear before white_block_1 becomes clear.
5. orange_block_1 is held by the arm in at least one state: This means at some point we need to pick up orange_block_1.

Okay, now let's plan the steps to satisfy all the constraints and achieve the goal:

First, let's focus on making orange_block_1 clear (which is needed for constraint 4):
1. In the initial state, black_block_1 is on top of red_block_1, which is on top of orange_block_1. So, we need to unstack black_block_1 from red_block_1.
2. Then, we need to unstack red_block_1 from orange_block_1.

Once orange_block_1 is clear, we need to make white_block_1 clear (constraint 3):
3. We need to unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_2.
4. Then, we need to unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_1.

Constraint 5 requires us to hold orange_block_1 at some point:
5. After orange_block_1 is clear, we can pick it up.

Constraint 2 requires red_block_1 to be clear at some point after (or during) black_block_1 not being on the table. In the initial state, black_block_1 is not on the table, so we need to make red_block_1 clear:
6. Ensure red_block_1 is clear after unstacking black_block_1.

Finally, to achieve the goal, we need to get orange_block_2 on top of black_block_1:
7. Place orange_block_2 on top of black_block_1.

Let's create a step-by-step plan:

1. unstack black_block_1 red_block_1 (this helps with constraint 1 and is a step towards constraint 2)
2. unstack red_block_1 orange_block_1 (this helps with constraint 4)
3. We have the option to putdown black_block_1 on the table or stack it somewhere. Let's putdown for now.
   putdown black_block_1
4. We have the option to putdown red_block_1 on the table or stack it somewhere. Let's putdown for now.
   putdown red_block_1
5. Now, orange_block_1 is clear. To satisfy constraint 5, we need to pickup orange_block_1.
   pickup orange_block_1
6. We need to decide where to place orange_block_1. Let's place it on the table for now.
   putdown orange_block_1
7. Now, let's make white_block_1 clear, as required by constraint 3.
   unstack green_block_1 orange_block_2
8. We need to decide where to place green_block_1. Let's place it on the table for now.
   putdown green_block_1
9. unstack orange_block_2 white_block_1
10. Finally, to achieve the goal, we need to place orange_block_2 on top of black_block_1.
    stack orange_block_2 black_block_1

Let's check if the constraints are satisfied:
1. black_block_1 is not on the table: Satisfied in the initial state and after step 1.
2. If black_block_1 is not on the table, then red_block_1 is clear: In the initial state, black_block_1 is not on the table, and red_block_1 becomes clear after step 1.
3. white_block_1 is clear: Satisfied after step 9.
4. If white_block_1 is clear, then orange_block_1 was clear in an earlier state: white_block_1 becomes clear after step 9, and orange_block_1 becomes clear after step 2, which is earlier.
5. orange_block_1 is held by the arm: Satisfied in step 5.

Now, let's re-evaluate our plan and see if we can optimize it further.

Actually, I think there's a problem with our plan. If we execute steps 1 and 2, black_block_1 and red_block_1 are being held by the arm consecutively. But according to constraint 2, we need red_block_1 to be clear at some point after or during the time black_block_1 is not on the table. 

In the initial state, black_block_1 is not on the table (it's on red_block_1), but red_block_1 is not clear (it has black_block_1 on top of it). If we unstack black_block_1 from red_block_1, then red_block_1 becomes clear, which satisfies constraint 2.

Let's re-plan:

1. unstack black_block_1 red_block_1 (this helps with constraints 1 and 2)
2. putdown black_block_1 (we'll place it on the table for now)
3. unstack red_block_1 orange_block_1 (this helps with constraint 4)
4. putdown red_block_1 (we'll place it on the table for now)
5. pickup orange_block_1 (this satisfies constraint 5)
6. putdown orange_block_1 (we'll place it on the table for now)
7. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_2
8. putdown green_block_1
9. unstack orange_block_2 white_block_1 (after this, white_block_1 is clear, satisfying constraint 3)
10. stack orange_block_2 black_block_1 (this achieves the goal)

Let's check the constraints again:
1. black_block_1 is not on the table: Satisfied in the initial state.
2. If black_block_1 is not on the table, then red_block_1 is clear: In the initial state, black_block_1 is not on the table, and after step 1, red_block_1 becomes clear, which satisfies the constraint.
3. white_block_1 is clear: Satisfied after step 9.
4. If white_block_1 is clear, then orange_block_1 was clear in an earlier state: white_block_1 becomes clear after step 9, and orange_block_1 becomes clear after step 3, which is earlier.
5. orange_block_1 is held by the arm: Satisfied in step 5.

The plan works, but let's see if we can optimize it further.

Thinking about it, let's more carefully consider the goal. We need orange_block_2 on top of black_block_1. In the initial state, orange_block_2 is on top of white_block_1, and black_block_1 is on top of red_block_1. We need to unstack both of these to achieve the goal.

Could there be a shorter plan? Let's think about this.

The constraints say:
1. black_block_1 is not on the table in at least one state: This is already satisfied in the initial state.
2. If black_block_1 is not on the table, then red_block_1 is clear in that state or a later state: In the initial state, black_block_1 is not on the table, so we need to ensure red_block_1 becomes clear at some point.
3. white_block_1 is clear in at least one state: We need to ensure white_block_1 becomes clear at some point.
4. If white_block_1 is clear, then orange_block_1 was clear in an earlier state: This means we need to ensure orange_block_1 is clear before white_block_1 becomes clear.
5. orange_block_1 is held by the arm in at least one state: We need to pickup orange_block_1 at some point.

Let's try to create a more efficient plan:

1. unstack black_block_1 red_block_1 (this addresses constraint 2, making red_block_1 clear after black_block_1 is not on the table)
2. putdown black_block_1
3. unstack red_block_1 orange_block_1 (this makes orange_block_1 clear)
4. putdown red_block_1
5. pickup orange_block_1 (this satisfies constraint 5)
6. putdown orange_block_1
7. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_2
8. putdown green_block_1
9. unstack orange_block_2 white_block_1 (this satisfies constraint 3, making white_block_1 clear)
10. stack orange_block_2 black_block_1 (this achieves the goal)

It seems like 10 steps is the minimum for this problem, given the constraints.

But let's just double-check if we're interpreting the constraints correctly.

1. black_block_1 is not on the table in at least one state: This is already satisfied in the initial state.
2. If black_block_1 is not on the table, then red_block_1 is clear in that state or a later state: In the initial state, black_block_1 is not on the table, so we need to ensure red_block_1 becomes clear at some point.
3. white_block_1 is clear in at least one state: We need to ensure white_block_1 becomes clear at some point.
4. If white_block_1 is clear, then orange_block_1 was clear in an earlier state: This means we need to ensure orange_block_1 is clear before white_block_1 becomes clear.
5. orange_block_1 is held by the arm in at least one state: We need to pickup orange_block_1 at some point.

For the second constraint, it says "If black_block_1 is not on the table, then red_block_1 is clear in that state or a later state." In the initial state, black_block_1 is not on the table, but red_block_1 is not clear. So, we need to make red_block_1 clear at some point.

Alright I think our plan is valid and the logic is correct. Let's summarize the plan:

1. unstack black_block_1 red_block_1
2. putdown black_block_1
3. unstack red_block_1 orange_block_1
4. putdown red_block_1
5. pickup orange_block_1
6. putdown orange_block_1
7. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_2
8. putdown green_block_1
9. unstack orange_block_2 white_block_1
10. stack orange_block_2 black_block_1

Actually, I'm now re-examining constraint 4: "If white_block_1 is clear, then orange_block_1 was clear in an earlier state."

In my plan, I first make orange_block_1 clear (after step 3), then I make white_block_1 clear (after step 9), which ensures that orange_block_1 was clear before white_block_1 was clear, satisfying the constraint.

And for constraint 2, because black_block_1 is not on the table in the initial state, we need red_block_1 to be clear in the initial state or a later state. After I unstack black_block_1 from red_block_1 in step 1, red_block_1 becomes clear, which satisfies this constraint.

Let me make sure that my plan is correct in light of both of these constraints:

1. constraint 2: I unstack black_block_1 red_block_1, which makes red_block_1 clear. So, red_block_1 is clear in a later state, satisfying the constraint.
2. constraint 4: In my plan, orange_block_1 becomes clear in step 3, and white_block_1 becomes clear in step 9. Since step 3 is earlier than step 9, the constraint is satisfied.

I think this plan is valid. Is it more efficient than before? It takes 10 steps. Let's see if we can reduce this further.

For the fourth constraint, we need to ensure that orange_block_1 is clear before white_block_1 is clear. In the initial state, orange_block_1 is not clear (since red_block_1 is on top of it, and black_block_1 is on top of red_block_1), and white_block_1 is not clear (since orange_block_2 is on top of it, and green_block_1 is on top of orange_block_2). So, we need to unstack all these blocks to make orange_block_1 and white_block_1 clear.

Let's see if it's necessary to pick up orange_block_1. Considering our goal to have orange_block_2 on top of black_block_1, picking up orange_block_1 doesn't seem necessary to achieve the goal. But constraint 5 explicitly requires us to hold orange_block_1 at some point, so we need to include it in our plan.

I don't think we can be more efficient since we need to:
1. Make red_block_1 clear (to satisfy constraint 2)
2. Make orange_block_1 clear (to satisfy constraint 4)
3. Make white_block_1 clear (to satisfy constraint 3)
4. Pick up orange_block_1 (to satisfy constraint 5)
5. Place orange_block_2 on top of black_block_1 (to achieve the goal)

Each of these steps requires a specific action (or a set of actions), and I don't see a way to skip or combine any of these in our plan.

Alright, I think our plan is optimal:

1. unstack black_block_1 red_block_1
2. putdown black_block_1
3. unstack red_block_1 orange_block_1
4. putdown red_block_1
5. pickup orange_block_1
6. putdown orange_block_1
7. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_2
8. putdown green_block_1
9. unstack orange_block_2 white_block_1
10. stack orange_block_2 black_block_1

Let's double-check one last time:
1. The goal is achieved: orange_block_2 is on top of black_block_1 (step 10).
2. Constraint 1 is satisfied: black_block_1 is not on the table in the initial state (it's on red_block_1).
3. Constraint 2 is satisfied: In the initial state, black_block_1 is not on the table, and after step 1, red_block_1 becomes clear.
4. Constraint 3 is satisfied: white_block_1 is clear after step 9.
5. Constraint 4 is satisfied: orange_block_1 is clear after step 3, which is earlier than step 9 when white_block_1 becomes clear.
6. Constraint 5 is satisfied: We pick up orange_block_1 in step 5.

Is this the optimal plan (i.e., the shortest valid plan)? I think so, and I don't see any way to reduce the number of steps further while still satisfying all the constraints.

Actually, one more think to check. Let me walk through this step-by-step again:

Constraint 2 is: "If expression 'black_block_1 is not on the table' holds in some state s, then expression 'there is no block on top of red_block_1, i.e., red_block_1 is clear' must hold at s or at some state after s."

Initial state: black_block_1 is on top of red_block_1. So the first part of the constraint holds (black_block_1 is not on the table).

Given that the first part holds, the second part must hold in the same state or a later state. In the initial state, red_block_1 is not clear (black_block_1 is on top of it). So, red_block_1 must become clear at some point.

After step 1 (unstack black_block_1 red_block_1), red_block_1 becomes clear. So, the constraint is satisfied.

I think our plan is valid and optimal.

Let's just double check that we're using the right action format:
1. unstack black_block_1 red_block_1
2. putdown black_block_1
3. unstack red_block_1 orange_block_1
4. putdown red_block_1
5. pickup orange_block_1
6. putdown orange_block_1
7. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_2
8. putdown green_block_1
9. unstack orange_block_2 white_block_1
10. stack orange_block_2 black_block_1

I've used the action names provided, and for each argument, I've used the corresponding element from the domain. So, the format of each action is: 'ActionName Argument1 ... ArgumentN', as requested.

I think our plan is valid, optimal, and in the correct format.
