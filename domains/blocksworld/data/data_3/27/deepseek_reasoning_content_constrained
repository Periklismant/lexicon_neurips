Okay, let's tackle this Blocksworld problem. The goal is to get orange_block_2 on top of black_block_1. But there are several constraints to satisfy. Let's start by understanding the initial state and the required conditions.

First, the initial setup:

- orange_block_1 is on the table with red_block_1 on top of it, and then black_block_1 on top of red_block_1. So the tower here is orange_block_1 (table) → red_block_1 → black_block_1 (clear).
- white_block_1 is on the table with orange_block_2 on top, then green_block_1 on top of orange_block_2. So tower: white_block_1 → orange_block_2 → green_block_1 (clear).
- red_block_2 is alone on the table, clear.

The goal is to have orange_block_2 on black_block_1. So we need to move orange_block_2 from its current position (on white_block_1, under green_block_1) to black_block_1. But black_block_1 is currently on top of red_block_1, which is on orange_block_1. 

Constraints:

1. At some point, black_block_1 must not be on the table. Since initially it's on red_block_1, which is on the table, but if we move it, maybe that's when it's not on the table. But wait, moving black_block_1 would require unstacking it. Wait, black_block_1 is clear initially. So we can unstack it from red_block_1. If we do that, black_block_1 is held, so it's not on the table. But the first constraint requires that in at least one state, black_block_1 is not on the table. So if we pick up black_block_1, that's satisfied. But then, after that, when we put it down, maybe on another block, it's not on the table. So that's possible.

But the second constraint says that if black_block_1 is not on the table in some state, then red_block_1 must be clear in that state or a later one. So when we unstack black_block_1 from red_block_1, red_block_1 becomes clear. So that's good. So moving black_block_1 would satisfy both constraints 1 and 2, as unstacking it would make red_block_1 clear, which would satisfy the second constraint.

Third constraint: At some point, white_block_1 must be clear. Currently, white_block_1 has orange_block_2 and green_block_1 on it. To make white_block_1 clear, we need to remove all blocks above it. That means moving green_block_1 and orange_block_2. But our goal is to put orange_block_2 on black_block_1. So we need to move orange_block_2. But first, green_block_1 is on top of orange_block_2, so we need to unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_2, then put it down. Then we can unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_1. But doing that would make white_block_1 clear, which satisfies the third constraint. But the fourth constraint says that if white_block_1 is clear in some state, there must be an earlier state where orange_block_1 is clear. Orange_block_1 initially has red_block_1 and black_block_1 on it. So to make orange_block_1 clear, we need to remove those blocks. So maybe we have to first unstack black_block_1 from red_block_1, then unstack red_block_1 from orange_block_1. Then orange_block_1 would be clear. But that's after moving black_block_1. Wait, the fourth constraint requires that before white_block_1 is clear (which happens when we remove orange_block_2), orange_block_1 must have been clear in an earlier state. So the sequence would need to have orange_block_1 being clear before white_block_1 is made clear.

Fifth constraint: Must be holding orange_block_1 at some point. But orange_block_1 is on the table with red_block_1 on it. To pick up orange_block_1, red_block_1 and black_block_1 must be removed first. Because to pickup a block, it must be clear and on the table. So to get orange_block_1, we need to first remove red_block_1 and black_block_1.

Putting all this together:

The goal is orange_block_2 on black_block_1. So steps needed:

1. Remove green_block_1 from orange_block_2 (so we can access orange_block_2).
2. Remove orange_block_2 from white_block_1 (to move it to black_block_1).
3. But to put orange_block_2 on black_block_1, black_block_1 must be clear. Currently, black_block_1 is clear, but if we unstack it from red_block_1, then red_block_1 becomes clear. Wait, but the goal is to place orange_block_2 on black_block_1. So maybe we need to move black_block_1 somewhere else first? Wait no. Wait, if black_block_1 is on red_block_1, then if we want to place orange_block_2 on top of black_block_1, that's possible if black_block_1 is clear. But currently, black_block_1 is clear. Wait, but in the initial state, black_block_1 is on red_block_1, which is on orange_block_1. So the initial position of black_block_1 is on red_block_1. So if we want to stack orange_block_2 on black_block_1, we need to have black_block_1 in a position where it's clear. Which it is. Wait, but orange_block_2 is currently under green_block_1. So first, we need to unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_2, then unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_1, then stack it on black_block_1. But wait, black_block_1 is on red_block_1. So stacking orange_block_2 on black_block_1 would form a tower: red_block_1 (on orange_block_1) → black_block_1 → orange_block_2. That's acceptable. But then, the constraint that black_block_1 is not on the table. Currently, black_block_1 is on red_block_1, which is on the table. So black_block_1 is not on the table. Wait, the initial state has black_block_1 on red_block_1, which is on orange_block_1. Wait, no: initial state says "red_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1", and "black_block_1 is on top of red_block_1". So orange_block_1 is on the table, with red_block_1 on it, then black_block_1. So black_block_1 is not on the table. So constraint 1 is already satisfied in the initial state. Wait, the first constraint says "black_block_1 is not on the table" must hold in at least one state. But in the initial state, black_block_1 is on red_block_1, which is on orange_block_1 (which is on the table). So black_block_1 is not on the table. So the initial state already satisfies constraint 1. But the problem says "must hold in at least one state", so that's already covered. But perhaps during the plan, black_block_1 is moved. Wait, but if we don't move it, then the initial state satisfies it. However, the plan must still satisfy all constraints regardless. Wait, the problem states that the constraints must hold in the plan. So if the initial state already meets constraint 1, then that's fine. But perhaps the problem requires that the constraint is met during the plan execution, not just in the initial state. Wait, the problem says "must hold in at least one state". So the initial state counts. So maybe we don't need to do anything for constraint 1. But wait, perhaps in the initial state, black_block_1 is not on the table. So constraint 1 is already satisfied. So that's okay. Then constraint 2 is: if in any state s, black_block_1 is not on the table, then red_block_1 must be clear in s or later. Since in the initial state, black_block_1 is not on the table (it's on red_block_1), then constraint 2 requires that red_block_1 is clear in the initial state or later. But in the initial state, red_block_1 has black_block_1 on top, so it's not clear. So the initial state does not satisfy the implication (because the antecedent is true, but the consequent is false). Therefore, the initial state violates the constraint. Therefore, the plan must include actions that ensure that whenever black_block_1 is not on the table (which is always except when it's on the table), then red_block_1 is clear at that state or later. But since in the initial state, black_block_1 is not on the table, but red_block_1 is not clear (has black_block_1 on it), this violates constraint 2. So the initial state is invalid with respect to the constraints. Therefore, the plan must include some action that makes red_block_1 clear in a state after the initial state. How? By moving black_block_1 off red_block_1. Because when you unstack black_block_1 from red_block_1, red_block_1 becomes clear. So unstacking black_block_1 would satisfy that. Therefore, in the plan, we need to unstack black_block_1 from red_block_1, which will make red_block_1 clear. Then, in any state after that, if black_block_1 is not on the table (like when it's being held, or placed on another block), then red_block_1 is clear. So this would satisfy constraint 2.

So the plan must include unstacking black_block_1 from red_block_1. Then, red_block_1 becomes clear. So after that, whenever black_block_1 is not on the table (which would be when it's being held or placed elsewhere), the constraint is satisfied because red_block_1 is clear.

So the steps would be:

1. Unstack black_block_1 from red_block_1. This makes red_block_1 clear. Now, the robotic arm is holding black_block_1.

Now, where to put it? We need to place it somewhere. If we put it on the table, then later we can stack orange_block_2 on it. But then, putting it on the table would make it on the table again, but we need to have it not on the table for constraint 1. Wait, but constraint 1 is already satisfied in the initial state, but after putting black_block_1 on the table, it would be on the table. But the constraint requires that in at least one state, it's not on the table. So as long as there's at least one state where it's not on the table, the constraint is met. Since the initial state has it not on the table, even if we later put it on the table, the constraint is still satisfied. But the problem says "must hold in at least one state", so the initial state counts. So perhaps even if we put black_block_1 back on the table later, the constraint is still okay. But no, the initial state is part of the problem's state sequence. So the plan must have at least one state (including initial) where black_block_1 is not on the table. Since the initial state is already there, the constraint is satisfied. However, the problem says that the plan must bring about the goal while satisfying the constraints. So the initial state is considered part of the states, so the first constraint is met. But the second constraint says that whenever black_block_1 is not on the table in any state, then red_block_1 must be clear in that state or later. So in the initial state, black_block_1 is not on the table, but red_block_1 is not clear. Therefore, the plan must ensure that after the initial state, red_block_1 becomes clear. Which can be done by unstacking black_block_1 from red_block_1. Once that's done, red_block_1 is clear. So any state after that where black_block_1 is not on the table (like when it's being held, or placed elsewhere) would have red_block_1 clear in that state or later.

So the first action should be unstack black_block_1 from red_block_1. Then, perhaps put it down on the table, but that would make red_block_1 clear. Alternatively, we can stack it somewhere else. But let's see.

But the goal requires orange_block_2 to be on black_block_1. So we need to have black_block_1 as a base. So after moving black_block_1, we can stack orange_block_2 on it. But where is black_block_1 after unstacking? Let's say we put it on the table. Then, we can stack orange_block_2 on it. But then, black_block_1 is on the table, which is allowed. But the goal is orange_block_2 on black_block_1. So the final state would have black_block_1 on the table with orange_block_2 on top. That's acceptable. But wait, the initial state of black_block_1 is on red_block_1, which is on orange_block_1. So moving it to the table would be a valid position. So steps:

1. Unstack black_block_1 from red_block_1. Now holding black_block_1, red_block_1 is clear.
2. Putdown black_block_1 on the table. Now black_block_1 is on table, clear.
3. Now, need to get orange_block_2. But orange_block_2 is under green_block_1 on white_block_1. So we need to unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_2.
4. Unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_2. Now holding green_block_1.
5. Putdown green_block_1 on table.
6. Now, unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_1. Now holding orange_block_2. This makes white_block_1 clear, satisfying constraint 3. But constraint 4 says that if white_block_1 is clear in some state, there must be an earlier state where orange_block_1 is clear. In our current plan, when we unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_1 (step 6), white_block_1 becomes clear. So we need to have had orange_block_1 clear before that. But initially, orange_block_1 has red_block_1 on it. To make orange_block_1 clear, we need to remove red_block_1. But red_block_1 was under black_block_1, which we already moved. So after step 1, red_block_1 is clear. Then, we could unstack red_block_1 from orange_block_1. Wait, but in step 1, we unstacked black_block_1 from red_block_1, making red_block_1 clear. So red_block_1 is clear now. So to make orange_block_1 clear, we need to unstack red_block_1 from it. So after step 2 (putdown black_block_1), next steps could be:

3. Unstack red_block_1 from orange_block_1. Now holding red_block_1, orange_block_1 is clear. This satisfies the constraint 4's requirement because when we later make white_block_1 clear (step 6), there was an earlier state (step 3) where orange_block_1 was clear. Also, constraint 5 requires holding orange_block_1. But in this plan, we haven't held orange_block_1 yet. So we need to pick up orange_block_1 at some point. So after making orange_block_1 clear, we can pickup orange_block_1. Let's adjust the plan:

1. Unstack black_block_1 from red_block_1. Holding black_block_1, red_block_1 clear.
2. Putdown black_block_1 on table. Now black_block_1 on table.
3. Unstack red_block_1 from orange_block_1. Holding red_block_1, orange_block_1 clear.
4. Putdown red_block_1 on table. Now red_block_1 on table.
5. Now, orange_block_1 is clear. We need to hold it to satisfy constraint 5. So pickup orange_block_1. Then put it down again, but that might be unnecessary. But the constraint is that at some state, we're holding orange_block_1. So after step 3, we have red_block_1. So after step 4 (putdown red_block_1), we can pickup orange_block_1.

So steps 5 and 6:

5. Pickup orange_block_1. Now holding it. (This satisfies constraint 5)
6. Putdown orange_block_1. Now it's back on table, clear.

But this seems like extra steps. However, since the plan must include holding orange_block_1, we need to have a pickup action for it. But after step 3, orange_block_1 is clear. So we can do:

After step 4 (putdown red_block_1):

5. Pickup orange_block_1. Now holding it. (Satisfies constraint 5)
6. Putdown orange_block_1. Now it's on table again.

Then proceed to handle orange_block_2:

7. Unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_2. Holding green_block_1.
8. Putdown green_block_1.
9. Unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_1. Now holding orange_block_2. White_block_1 becomes clear here. But we need to check constraint 4: when white_block_1 becomes clear (step 9), there must have been an earlier state where orange_block_1 was clear. In this plan, orange_block_1 was cleared in step 3 (after unstacking red_block_1), and then picked up in step 5. So when we unstack orange_block_2 in step 9, the state where orange_block_1 was clear (step 3-4) is before. So constraint 4 is satisfied.

Then, stack orange_block_2 on black_block_1:

10. Stack orange_block_2 black_block_1. Now, orange_block_2 is on black_block_1, which is on the table. That achieves the goal.

But wait, the goal is to have orange_block_2 on black_block_1. So this would satisfy it. Let's check the steps:

1. unstack black_block_1 red_block_1
2. putdown black_block_1
3. unstack red_block_1 orange_block_1
4. putdown red_block_1
5. pickup orange_block_1
6. putdown orange_block_1
7. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_2
8. putdown green_block_1
9. unstack orange_block_2 white_block_1
10. stack orange_block_2 black_block_1

But this seems lengthy. Is there a shorter path?

Alternatively, after unstacking black_block_1 and putting it on the table, maybe we can stack orange_block_2 on black_block_1 directly. Let's see:

But orange_block_2 is under green_block_1. So steps:

1. unstack black_block_1 red_block_1
2. putdown black_block_1
3. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_2
4. putdown green_block_1
5. unstack orange_block_2 white_block_1
6. stack orange_block_2 black_block_1

This is shorter. But in this case, does it satisfy all constraints?

Let's check constraints:

- Constraint 1: black_block_1 not on table in at least one state. Initially, yes. After step 2, black_block_1 is on table. But the initial state counts, so constraint 1 is satisfied.

- Constraint 2: whenever black_block_1 is not on table, red_block_1 must be clear in that state or later. In the initial state, black_block_1 is not on table, but red_block_1 is not clear. So this violates constraint 2. Therefore, we need to unstack black_block_1 to make red_block_1 clear. So step 1: unstack black_block_1 from red_block_1. This makes red_block_1 clear. So after step 1, any state where black_block_1 is not on the table (like during step 1, when it's held, or if we stack it elsewhere) will have red_block_1 clear in that state or later. For example, in step 1, after unstacking, red_block_1 is clear. So in the state after step 1, if black_block_1 is not on the table (it's being held), then red_block_1 is clear. So constraint 2 is satisfied.

So in the shorter plan:

1. unstack black_block_1 red_block_1 → red_block_1 clear.
2. putdown black_block_1 → black_block_1 on table.
3. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_2 → holding green_block_1.
4. putdown green_block_1.
5. unstack orange_block_2 white_block_1 → holding orange_block_2, white_block_1 clear. 
6. stack orange_block_2 black_block_1 → goal achieved.

But does this satisfy all constraints?

Constraint 3: white_block_1 must be clear in at least one state. Step 5 makes white_block_1 clear. So that's satisfied.

Constraint 4: if white_block_1 is clear (step 5), there must be an earlier state where orange_block_1 is clear. In this plan, when is orange_block_1 clear? Initially, orange_block_1 has red_block_1 and black_block_1 on it. After step 1, black_block_1 is removed, but red_block_1 is still on orange_block_1. So orange_block_1 is not clear. Then, after step 1, we putdown black_block_1. Then step 3: unstack green_block_1. Then step 5: unstack orange_block_2. So orange_block_1 is not cleared in this plan. So constraint 4 is violated. Because in step 5, white_block_1 is clear, but there was no earlier state where orange_block_1 was clear. So this plan doesn't satisfy constraint 4.

So we need to ensure that before white_block_1 becomes clear, orange_block_1 is cleared at some point. To do that, we need to clear orange_block_1. Which involves removing red_block_1 from it. So after unstacking black_block_1, we need to unstack red_block_1 from orange_block_1. Let's adjust the plan:

1. unstack black_block_1 red_block_1 → red_block_1 clear.
2. putdown black_block_1.
3. unstack red_block_1 orange_block_1 → holding red_block_1, orange_block_1 clear.
4. putdown red_block_1.
5. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_2 → holding green_block_1.
6. putdown green_block_1.
7. unstack orange_block_2 white_block_1 → white_block_1 clear. Here, constraint 4 requires that before this step, orange_block_1 was clear. Which happened in step 3. So that's satisfied.
8. stack orange_block_2 black_block_1 → goal.

But also, constraint 5 requires holding orange_block_1. In this plan, we haven't picked up orange_block_1. So we need to add that. So after step 4, we can:

5. pickup orange_block_1 → now holding it (satisfies constraint 5)
6. putdown orange_block_1 → but this is extra steps. Alternatively, after step 3, orange_block_1 is clear. So after step 3, can we pickup orange_block_1?

So:

1. unstack black_block_1 red_block_1
2. putdown black_block_1
3. unstack red_block_1 orange_block_1 → red_block_1 held, orange_block_1 clear.
4. putdown red_block_1
5. pickup orange_block_1 → holding it (satisfies constraint 5)
6. putdown orange_block_1 → but this is two steps. But perhaps necessary.

Then proceed:

7. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_2
8. putdown green_block_1
9. unstack orange_block_2 white_block_1
10. stack orange_block_2 black_block_1

This plan has 10 steps. But maybe there's a shorter way. Let's see:

Alternatively, after step 3 (unstack red_block_1 from orange_block_1), instead of putting down red_block_1, could we stack it somewhere else? But that may not help. Also, after step 3, we're holding red_block_1, and orange_block_1 is clear. So to pickup orange_block_1, we need to putdown red_block_1 first. So steps:

3. unstack red_block_1 orange_block_1 → holding red_block_1, orange_block_1 clear.
4. putdown red_block_1 → now red_block_1 on table.
5. pickup orange_block_1 → now holding it. (constraint 5 satisfied)
6. putdown orange_block_1 → but this is unnecessary unless required by the plan. Wait, the constraint is to hold it, not to move it. So just picking it up and putting it down satisfies the constraint. But perhaps there's a way to use orange_block_1 in the plan. But the goal doesn't require moving orange_block_1, so this is extra steps. But necessary to satisfy constraint 5.

So the steps would be:

1. unstack black_block_1 red_block_1
2. putdown black_block_1
3. unstack red_block_1 orange_block_1
4. putdown red_block_1
5. pickup orange_block_1
6. putdown orange_block_1
7. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_2
8. putdown green_block_1
9. unstack orange_block_2 white_block_1
10. stack orange_block_2 black_block_1

But this seems long. Let's see if any steps can be optimized.

Wait, after step 3 (unstack red_block_1), if we putdown red_block_1, then orange_block_1 is clear, and we can pick it up. But perhaps instead of putting down red_block_1, we could stack it somewhere else. For example, stack red_block_1 on white_block_1. But white_block_1 has orange_block_2 and green_block_1. So that's not possible unless we clear white_block_1 first. But that's more steps. Probably not helpful.

Alternatively, after step 3, hold red_block_1 and orange_block_1 is clear. Then, stack red_block_1 on another block. But where? Maybe on the table. So step 4 is putdown red_block_1. Then proceed.

Alternatively, maybe after step 3, stack red_block_1 on black_block_1. But black_block_1 is on the table. So after step 2, black_block_1 is on the table. So step 4: stack red_block_1 black_block_1. But red_block_1 is clear. So stack red_block_1 on black_block_1. Then, black_block_1 has red_block_1 on top. But then, orange_block_1 is clear. But this would require:

3. unstack red_block_1 orange_block_1 → holding red_block_1.
4. stack red_block_1 black_block_1 → places red_block_1 on black_block_1. Now, black_block_1 is not clear (has red_block_1 on top). So then, to stack orange_block_2 on black_block_1, we need to clear black_block_1 again, which would require unstacking red_block_1. That adds more steps. Not helpful.

So perhaps the initial plan with 10 steps is necessary.

But maybe there's a more optimal way. Let's think again.

The constraints:

- Must hold orange_block_1 at some point. So steps must include a pickup of orange_block_1.

- When white_block_1 is cleared (step 9 in the initial plan), there must have been a previous state where orange_block_1 was cleared. So after step 3, orange_block_1 is cleared. Then, after step 5, picked up and put down. So that's okay.

So the plan:

1. unstack black_block_1 red_block_1 → red_block_1 clear (satisfies constraint 2)
2. putdown black_block_1 → on table
3. unstack red_block_1 orange_block_1 → red_block_1 held, orange_block_1 clear (satisfies part of constraint 4)
4. putdown red_block_1 → on table
5. pickup orange_block_1 → satisfies constraint 5
6. putdown orange_block_1 → back on table
7. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_2 → green_block_1 held
8. putdown green_block_1 → on table
9. unstack orange_block_2 white_block_1 → orange_block_2 held, white_block_1 clear (constraint 3)
10. stack orange_block_2 black_block_1 → goal achieved.

This plan has 10 steps. But is there a shorter way?

Wait, after step 3 (unstack red_block_1), we have to putdown red_block_1 (step 4). Then pickup orange_block_1 (step 5), put it down (step 6). But maybe after step 5, we can stack orange_block_1 somewhere, but the goal doesn't require it. Alternatively, can we avoid putting it down? No, because after pickup, to proceed with other actions, we need to be holding the block. For example, after step 5, we're holding orange_block_1. To unstack green_block_1, we need to be free. So we have to putdown orange_block_1 (step 6).

Alternatively, maybe after step 5 (holding orange_block_1), we can stack it on another block. But that would require another block to be clear. For example, stack orange_block_1 on red_block_2. But red_block_2 is on the table and clear. So step 6: stack orange_block_1 red_block_2. Then, red_block_2 is not clear. But this is allowed. But this adds a step, but maybe saves a putdown. Wait, no: stacking is an action, which requires holding the block. So stacking would replace the putdown. So step 5: pickup orange_block_1. Step 6: stack orange_block_1 red_block_2. Then, we are free. So that's two steps instead of putdown. But this doesn't save steps. It's still two actions. So no gain.

So the plan length remains the same.

Alternatively, perhaps we can avoid putting down red_block_1. But after step 3, we're holding red_block_1. To pickup orange_block_1, we need to putdown red_block_1. So steps 4 and 5 are necessary.

Is there any way to merge steps or find a more optimal path?

Another approach: After unstacking black_block_1, instead of putting it on the table, can we stack it somewhere else to save steps?

But where? The goal is to have orange_block_2 on black_block_1. So black_block_1 needs to be a base. If we stack black_block_1 on another block, then we'd have to move it again, which adds steps.

Alternatively, after unstacking black_block_1, hold it, then unstack green_block_1, put green_block_1 on black_block_1. But that would require stacking green_block_1 on black_block_1. Then, we can unstack orange_block_2. But this may not help.

Alternatively, after unstacking black_block_1, hold it, then unstack green_block_1 from orange_block_2, put green_block_1 down, then unstack orange_block_2, then stack orange_block_2 on black_block_1 while still holding it. But that's possible.

Wait, let's think:

1. unstack black_block_1 red_block_1 → holding black_block_1.
2. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_2 → can't, because we're holding black_block_1. So must putdown black_block_1 first.

So steps:

1. unstack black_block_1 red_block_1
2. putdown black_block_1
3. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_2
4. putdown green_block_1
5. unstack orange_block_2 white_block_1
6. stack orange_block_2 black_block_1

But again, this misses the constraint 4 and 5. So this approach would not satisfy those.

Thus, the only way to satisfy all constraints is to include the steps that clear orange_block_1 and hold it.

So the final plan must include:

- unstack black_block_1 to clear red_block_1 (satisfy constraint 2)
- unstack red_block_1 to clear orange_block_1 (for constraint 4)
- pickup orange_block_1 (satisfy constraint 5)
- unstack orange_block_2 to clear white_block_1 (satisfy constraint 3)
- stack orange_block_2 on black_block_1 (goal)

Putting this all together, the steps would be:

1. unstack black_block_1 red_block_1
2. putdown black_block_1
3. unstack red_block_1 orange_block_1
4. putdown red_block_1
5. pickup orange_block_1
6. putdown orange_block_1
7. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_2
8. putdown green_block_1
9. unstack orange_block_2 white_block_1
10. stack orange_block_2 black_block_1

This plan has 10 steps. Now, check if there's a shorter way.

Wait, after step 5 (pickup orange_block_1), can we stack it somewhere else instead of putting it down? For example, stack it on white_block_1. But white_block_1 has orange_block_2 and green_block_1. So we need to clear white_block_1 first. But that would require more steps. Not helpful.

Alternatively, after step 5, can we use orange_block_1 in the goal? The goal doesn't involve orange_block_1, so stacking it somewhere doesn't help.

Alternatively, after step 3, when we unstack red_block_1, can we stack it on black_block_1? Then, red_block_1 is on black_block_1. But then, black_block_1 is not clear, so we can't stack orange_block_2 on it. So we'd have to unstack red_block_1 again, which adds steps.

Thus, it seems the 10-step plan is the shortest possible.

But wait, maybe after step 3 (unstack red_block_1), instead of putting it down, we can put it directly on another block. For example, stack red_block_1 on red_block_2. Then, we can hold orange_block_1. Let's see:

1. unstack black_block_1 red_block_1
2. putdown black_block_1
3. unstack red_block_1 orange_block_1 → holding red_block_1
4. stack red_block_1 red_block_2 → now red_block_1 is on red_block_2, which is on the table. Now, red_block_2 is not clear, but that's okay.
5. pickup orange_block_1 → satisfies constraint 5
6. putdown orange_block_1
7. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_2
8. putdown green_block_1
9. unstack orange_block_2 white_block_1
10. stack orange_block_2 black_block_1

This plan is also 10 steps. No savings.

Alternatively, after step 4, stack red_block_1 on black_block_1. Then, to stack orange_block_2 on black_block_1, we need to unstack red_block_1 again. Which adds steps.

So no improvement.

Therefore, the minimal plan is 10 steps. But wait, perhaps there's a smarter way.

Wait, the fifth constraint requires holding orange_block_1 at some state. But what if we don't put it down and use it in another action? For example, after step 5, we're holding orange_block_1. Can we use it to stack on another block, thereby combining steps? For example, stack orange_block_1 on red_block_1, but red_block_1 is on the table. But after step 4, red_block_1 is on the table. So:

5. stack orange_block_1 red_block_1 → this would require red_block_1 to be clear. After step 4, red_block_1 is on the table and clear. So yes. So step 5: stack orange_block_1 red_block_1. Now, orange_block_1 is on red_block_1. This action would replace the putdown, but it's still one action. Then, when we need to pickup orange_block_1 again? Not necessary. But this way, we save a putdown step. But the constraint is just to hold orange_block_1 at some state, which is satisfied in step 5. So steps would be:

1. unstack black_block_1 red_block_1
2. putdown black_block_1
3. unstack red_block_1 orange_block_1
4. putdown red_block_1
5. pickup orange_block_1
6. stack orange_block_1 red_block_1 → now orange_block_1 is on red_block_1
7. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_2
8. putdown green_block_1
9. unstack orange_block_2 white_block_1
10. stack orange_block_2 black_block_1

This plan is 10 steps. No savings. But in step 6, we stack orange_block_1 on red_block_1, which might be useful if needed later. But since the goal doesn't require it, it's not necessary. So this doesn't help.

Alternatively, after stacking orange_block_1 on red_block_1, can we avoid some steps? Not really.

Thus, it seems the minimal plan has 10 steps. But wait, perhaps some steps can be reordered.

For example:

After unstacking black_block_1 and putting it down, then unstacking green_block_1 and orange_block_2, then handling red_block_1 and orange_block_1.

Let's try:

1. unstack black_block_1 red_block_1 → red_block_1 clear
2. putdown black_block_1
3. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_2
4. putdown green_block_1
5. unstack orange_block_2 white_block_1 → white_block_1 clear (constraint 3)
   But at this point, we haven't handled orange_block_1 yet. So when we make white_block_1 clear (step 5), we need to have had orange_block_1 clear before. But in this order, we haven't cleared orange_block_1 yet. So this violates constraint 4.

Thus, this order won't work. So the steps must be done in the order where orange_block_1 is cleared before white_block_1 is cleared.

Therefore, the correct order is to unstack red_block_1 and clear orange_block_1 before unstacking orange_block_2 to clear white_block_1.

Thus, the 10-step plan seems necessary. However, perhaps there's a way to reduce steps by combining actions.

Wait, after step 3 (unstack red_block_1 orange_block_1), we have red_block_1 in hand and orange_block_1 clear. Then, instead of putting down red_block_1 (step 4), can we stack it somewhere else that is clear. For example, stack it on red_block_2. Since red_block_2 is clear and on the table. So:

3. unstack red_block_1 orange_block_1 → holding red_block_1
4. stack red_block_1 red_block_2 → now red_block_1 is on red_block_2
5. pickup orange_block_1 → satisfies constraint 5
6. putdown orange_block_1
7. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_2
8. putdown green_block_1
9. unstack orange_block_2 white_block_1
10. stack orange_block_2 black_block_1

This plan has 10 steps. Same as before. No savings.

Another idea: after step 5 (pickup orange_block_1), can we use it to stack on black_block_1? But the goal is to stack orange_block_2 on black_block_1. Not necessary. But maybe after stacking orange_block_1 on black_block_1, then we can move it again, but that adds steps.

Thus, I think the 10-step plan is the minimal. However, let's check if there's a way to skip some steps.

Wait, after step 5 (pickup orange_block_1), we have to put it down (step 6) to proceed with other actions. But what if we hold onto orange_block_1 and use it to help move other blocks? For example, after step 5, we're holding orange_block_1. Can we stack orange_block_1 on green_block_1? But green_block_1 is on orange_block_2. To stack orange_block_1 on green_block_1, we need green_block_1 to be clear. Which it's not, until we unstack green_block_1. But that requires us to be empty-handed.

So no, that won't work. Thus, we must putdown orange_block_1.

So the plan seems to require 10 steps. But perhaps I'm missing a shorter path.

Another approach: 

- After unstacking black_block_1 and putting it down, instead of unstacking red_block_1, can we just unstack orange_block_2 and stack it on black_block_1? But orange_block_2 is under green_block_1, so we need to unstack green_block_1 first. But then, after unstacking green_block_1 and orange_block_2, we can stack orange_block_2 on black_block_1. But this plan would not address the constraint 4 and 5.

Let's see:

1. unstack black_block_1 red_block_1 → red_block_1 clear (satisfy constraint 2)
2. putdown black_block_1
3. unstack green_block_1 orange_block_2 → green_block_1 held
4. putdown green_block_1
5. unstack orange_block_2 white_block_1 → orange_block_2 held, white_block_1 clear (constraint 3)
6. stack orange_block_2 black_block_1 → goal achieved.

But this plan has 6 steps. However:

- Constraint 4: when white_block_1 is cleared (step 5), there must be an earlier state where orange_block_1 is clear. In this plan, orange_block_1 is never cleared. So constraint 4 is violated.

- Constraint 5: never holding orange_block_1.

Thus, this plan is invalid.

So, the correct plan must include steps to clear orange_block_1 and hold it, leading to at least 10 steps.

But wait, what if after unstacking black_block_1, we unstack red_block_1, then stack orange_block_2 on black_block_1 without moving green_block_1? But orange_block_2 is under green_block_1, so we can't access it until green_block_1 is moved.

Thus, no.

Another idea: When we unstack black_block_1, can we stack it on white_block_1? But white_block_1 has orange_block_2 and green_block_1. So no. Need to clear white_block_1 first.

So, no shortcuts. Thus, the minimal plan is 10 steps.

But maybe there's a way to reduce steps by combining actions. For example, after unstacking black_block_1, instead of putting it down, use it to hold another block. But this would require having a free hand, which we don't.

Alternatively, after step 1 (unstack black_block_1), we can stack it on white_block_1. But white_block_1 has orange_block_2 and green_block_1. So no.

No, that's not possible. So the plan must proceed as outlined.
