Okay, let's break this down. The goal is to get orange_block_2 on top of black_block_1. We have several constraints to satisfy along the way.

1.  **"black_block_1 is not on the table"**: This means we need to unstack black_block_1 from red_block_1 at some point.
2.  **"If black_block_1 is not on the table, then red_block_1 is clear (at that state or a later state)"**: This means after unstacking black_block_1, we need to make sure red_block_1 becomes clear, either immediately or later.
3.  **"white_block_1 is clear"**: We need to unstack orange_block_2 from white_block_1 at some point.
4.  **"If white_block_1 is clear, then orange_block_1 was clear earlier"**: This means we need to clear orange_block_1 before we clear white_block_1.
5.  **"you are holding orange_block_1"**: We need to pick up orange_block_1 at some point.

Here's a plan that addresses these constraints and achieves the goal:

```
```
unstack black_block_1 red_block_1
putdown black_block_1
unstack green_block_1 orange_block_2
putdown green_block_1
unstack red_block_1 orange_block_1
putdown red_block_1
pickup orange_block_1
stack orange_block_1 red_block_2
unstack orange_block_2 white_block_1
pickup orange_block_2
unstack orange_block_1 red_block_2
putdown orange_block_1
pickup black_block_1
stack orange_block_2 black_block_1
```
