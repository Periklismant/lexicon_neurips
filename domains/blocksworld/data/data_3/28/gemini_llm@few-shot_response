Okay, let's break this down. The goal is to be holding white_block_1. There are several constraints we need to satisfy along the way.

1.  **Constraint 1:** `white_block_1 is not on the table` must be true at some point. This is obvious, as we need to pick it up.
2.  **Constraint 2:** If `white_block_1 is not on the table`, then `blue_block_3 is on top of white_block_2` or `blue_block_3 is on the table` must be true at that point or later.
3.  **Constraint 3:** `there is a block on top of white_block_1` must be true at some point. This means we need to stack something on it.
4.  **Constraint 4:** If `there is a block on top of white_block_1`, then there must be an earlier state where `you are holding white_block_2`.
5.  **Constraint 5:** `blue_block_3 is on top of white_block_2` must be true at some point.

This suggests the following strategy:

1.  Unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_2.
2.  Stack blue_block_3 on white_block_2. This satisfies constraint 5.
3.  Stack white_block_2 on white_block_1. This satisfies constraint 3 and 4.
4.  Unstack white_block_2 from white_block_1.
5.  Pickup white_block_1. This satisfies constraint 1. Since blue_block_3 is on top of white_block_2, constraint 2 is also satisfied.

Here's the plan:

```
```
unstack white_block_2 blue_block_2
stack blue_block_3 white_block_2
stack white_block_2 white_block_1
unstack white_block_2 white_block_1
pickup white_block_1
```
