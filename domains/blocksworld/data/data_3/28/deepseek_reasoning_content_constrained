Okay, let's try to figure out how to solve this planning problem. The goal is to have the robotic arm holding white_block_1. But there are several constraints we need to satisfy along the way. Let me break down the problem step by step.

First, let's look at the initial state. The blocks are arranged as follows:

- blue_block_1, black_block_1, blue_block_2, white_block_1, brown_block_1 are on the table.
- blue_block_3 is on top of black_block_1.
- white_block_2 is on top of blue_block_2.
- All these blocks except where noted are clear (nothing on top of them). So, blue_block_3, white_block_2, and the ones on the table (like white_block_1) are clear initially.
- The arm is not holding anything.

The goal is to have the arm holding white_block_1. So the straightforward action would be to pickup white_block_1. But we need to check the preconditions for that. To pickup a block, it must be on the table, clear, and the arm must be empty. In the initial state, white_block_1 is on the table and clear, and the arm is empty. So theoretically, we could just do "pickup white_block_1" and be done. But wait, there are constraints that must be satisfied, so it's not that simple.

Let's look at the constraints one by one.

1. "white_block_1 is not on the table" must hold in at least one state. So during the plan, we need to have white_block_1 not on the table. Since the initial state has it on the table, and the final goal is holding it (so it's not on the table), that's satisfied in the final state. But maybe there's another step where it's put down again? Wait, no. The final state is holding it, so unless the plan includes putting it down and then picking it up again, but that would be longer. But maybe the constraint is already satisfied in the final state.

2. If "white_block_1 is not on the table" in some state s, then either "blue_block_3 is on top of white_block_2" or "blue_block_3 is on the table" must hold at s or after. So whenever white_block_1 is not on the table (which will happen when we pick it up), we need to ensure that either blue_block_3 is on white_block_2 or on the table at some point after that. But blue_block_3 is initially on black_block_1. So we might need to move blue_block_3 to either the table or onto white_block_2 at some point after white_block_1 is picked up.

3. "there is a block on top of white_block_1" in at least one state. That means we have to stack some block on white_block_1 at some point. But the goal is to have the arm holding white_block_1, so if we stack something on it, we'd have to then unstack it again. But that's adding steps, which might complicate things.

4. If white_block_1 has a block on top (i.e., is not clear) in some state, then there must be an earlier state where the arm was holding white_block_2. So, to put a block on white_block_1, say block X, we need to have held white_block_2 before that. But how does that connect? Maybe we need to use white_block_2 in some way before stacking something on white_block_1.

5. "blue_block_3 is on top of white_block_2" must hold in at least one state. So we need to stack blue_block_3 onto white_block_2 at some point.

Putting all these constraints together, the plan must include:

- Moving blue_block_3 onto white_block_2 (to satisfy constraint 5 and possibly 2).
- At some point, stack a block on white_block_1 (to satisfy constraint 3), which requires that before that, the arm held white_block_2 (constraint 4).
- Ensure that after white_block_1 is not on the table (when picked up or when moved), blue_block_3 is either on white_block_2 or the table (constraint 2).

But the goal is to hold white_block_1. Let's outline possible steps.

First, the straightforward plan would be to pickup white_block_1. But that doesn't satisfy all constraints. Let's see:

If we just do "pickup white_block_1", then:

- Constraint 1: white_block_1 is not on the table in the final state (since it's being held). So that's satisfied.

- Constraint 2: In the final state (s), since white_block_1 is not on the table, we need blue_block_3 to be on white_block_2 or the table at s or after. But in the final state, blue_block_3 is still on black_block_1 (since nothing was done to it). So this constraint would fail. Therefore, we need to ensure that after white_block_1 is picked up (i.e., in the final state), blue_block_3 is either on the table or on white_block_2. But in the initial state, blue_block_3 is on black_block_1. So we need to move it.

So, perhaps the plan must include moving blue_block_3 to either the table or white_block_2 before or after picking up white_block_1. But the constraint says that in the state where white_block_1 is not on the table (which is the final state here), blue_block_3 must be on white_block_2 or the table either in that state or some state after. However, since the plan ends with the final state, there are no states after. Therefore, in the final state, blue_block_3 must be on white_block_2 or the table.

So, to satisfy constraint 2, in the final state, blue_block_3 must be either on the table or on white_block_2. But in the initial state, it's on black_block_1. So we need to move it.

So, the plan must include moving blue_block_3 to either the table or white_block_2. Let's choose moving it to white_block_2 to satisfy constraint 5 (which requires that blue_block_3 is on white_block_2 in at least one state). That would kill two birds with one stone: satisfying constraints 2 and 5.

So steps needed:

1. Unstack blue_block_3 from black_block_1. Since it's on black_block_1 and clear, the arm can unstack it. Then stack it onto white_block_2.

But white_block_2 is initially on top of blue_block_2. So to stack blue_block_3 on white_block_2, white_block_2 must be clear. Wait, in the initial state, white_block_2 is on blue_block_2 and is clear. So we can stack on white_block_2 only if it's clear. Wait, no: when stacking, the target block (y) must be clear. So to stack blue_block_3 on white_block_2, white_block_2 must be clear. But white_block_2 is already clear (initial state). Wait, no: in the initial state, white_block_2 is on blue_block_2 and is clear. So yes, we can stack on it. Wait, but white_block_2 is on blue_block_2. To stack blue_block_3 onto white_block_2, the preconditions are that the arm is holding blue_block_3 and white_block_2 is clear. So first, we need to unstack blue_block_3 from black_block_1, then stack it on white_block_2.

But to unstack blue_block_3 from black_block_1, the preconditions are:

- blue_block_3 is on black_block_1.

- blue_block_3 is clear (which it is).

- The arm is not holding anything.

So yes, that's possible.

So steps so far:

unstack blue_block_3 black_block_1 → arm holds blue_block_3, black_block_1 becomes clear.

Then stack blue_block_3 white_block_2 → now blue_block_3 is on white_block_2. This satisfies constraint 5.

But then, after that, we need to make sure that when white_block_1 is not on the table (which will be when we pick it up), blue_block_3 is either on white_block_2 or the table. In this case, after stacking, blue_block_3 is on white_block_2, which satisfies the condition.

Now, the third constraint: white_block_1 must have a block on top in some state. So we need to stack something on white_block_1. But since the goal is to hold white_block_1, we can't leave a block on it. So we need to stack a block on it and then unstack it again.

But which block can we use? Let's see the available blocks. Maybe white_block_2, but it's under blue_block_3 now. Or blue_block_1, black_block_1, etc.

Wait, but after stacking blue_block_3 on white_block_2, white_block_2 is no longer clear. So we can't stack anything on white_block_2 anymore. But we might need to stack something on white_block_1.

But to stack something on white_block_1, that block must be clear and the arm must be holding it. Let's think.

Suppose after stacking blue_block_3 on white_block_2, we proceed to pick up another block, say brown_block_1 (which is on the table and clear), then stack it on white_block_1. Then, we have to unstack it to get white_block_1 clear again so we can pick it up. But that adds steps.

But constraint 3 requires that at some state, there's a block on top of white_block_1. So during the plan, we need to stack something on it and then remove it.

Additionally, constraint 4 says that if white_block_1 is not clear (i.e., has a block on top) in some state, then there must be an earlier state where the arm was holding white_block_2. So, to stack a block on white_block_1, say X, we need to have held white_block_2 before that.

Wait, but when we stack blue_block_3 onto white_block_2, the arm was holding blue_block_3, not white_block_2. So that doesn't count. So how do we satisfy constraint 4?

Constraint 4 says that whenever white_block_1 has a block on top (say in state s), there must be an earlier state where the arm held white_block_2. So, suppose we stack a block on white_block_1. Let's say we stack block X on white_block_1. Before that, we need to have held white_block_2 at some earlier point.

So, perhaps we need to pick up white_block_2, put it down, and then later stack something on white_block_1. But how?

Wait, white_block_2 is initially on blue_block_2. To pick it up, we need to unstack it from blue_block_2. Because it's on top of blue_block_2 and clear. So unstack white_block_2 blue_block_2. Then put it down, then perhaps use it again.

But how does that help? Let's outline possible steps.

Possible plan steps:

1. unstack blue_block_3 black_block_1 → hold blue_block_3.

2. stack blue_block_3 white_block_2 → now blue_block_3 is on white_block_2. Satisfies constraint 5.

Now, to satisfy constraint 3 and 4:

We need to have a state where white_block_1 has a block on top, and before that, the arm held white_block_2.

So let's think: after step 2, white_block_2 is under blue_block_3, so white_block_2 is not clear. So we can't unstack blue_block_3 from white_block_2 unless we do that, but that would require the arm to be empty. Let's see:

Suppose after step 2, we then proceed to unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_2. Wait, no: white_block_2 is under blue_block_3 now. Wait, after step 2, blue_block_3 is on white_block_2. So white_block_2 is not clear. So we can't unstack blue_block_3 from white_block_2 unless we pick it up. Wait, no: to unstack blue_block_3 from white_block_2, the arm must be empty, blue_block_3 must be on white_block_2, and blue_block_3 must be clear. But after stacking, blue_block_3 is on white_block_2, and blue_block_3 is clear (since stack action makes the top block clear). So yes, we can unstack it again.

But why would we need to do that? Maybe not. Let's think differently.

We need to have white_block_2 in the arm's history before stacking something on white_block_1. So perhaps we need to pick up white_block_2 at some point.

But white_block_2 is under blue_block_3 after step 2. So to pick up white_block_2, we need to first unstack blue_block_3 from white_block_2.

So steps could be:

3. unstack blue_block_3 white_block_2 → hold blue_block_3.

4. putdown blue_block_3 → now blue_block_3 is on the table.

5. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_2 → hold white_block_2.

6. putdown white_block_2 → now white_block_2 is on the table.

But this seems like unnecessary steps. But perhaps necessary to satisfy constraint 4.

Alternatively, maybe after stacking blue_block_3 on white_block_2 (step 2), we can unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_2? No, because white_block_2 has blue_block_3 on top now. Wait, no: after stacking blue_block_3 on white_block_2, white_block_2 is under blue_block_3. So white_block_2 is not clear. Therefore, we cannot unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_2 unless we first remove blue_block_3.

So steps 3 and 4: unstack blue_block_3 from white_block_2 and put it down. Then, unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_2.

But this is getting complicated. Let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps we can first move white_block_2 before stacking blue_block_3 on it. But that might not be necessary.

Wait, the initial state has white_block_2 on blue_block_2. So to pick up white_block_2, we can unstack it from blue_block_2. Then, perhaps stack it on white_block_1. But that would make white_block_1 have white_block_2 on top, satisfying constraint 3. Then, to pick up white_block_1, we need to unstack white_block_2 from it. But that requires that white_block_2 is clear. So after stacking white_block_2 on white_block_1, we would need to unstack it again.

But this seems possible. Let's outline:

Alternative plan steps:

1. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_2 → hold white_block_2.

2. stack white_block_2 white_block_1 → now white_block_2 is on white_block_1. This satisfies constraint 3 (white_block_1 is not clear) and constraint 4 (we held white_block_2 before stacking on white_block_1).

3. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1 → hold white_block_2 again.

4. stack white_block_2 blue_block_2 → return it to original position.

But then we also need to handle the blue_block_3 constraints. Because after moving white_block_2, we might not have addressed blue_block_3 being on white_block_2 or the table.

Wait, but the original plan needs to have blue_block_3 on white_block_2 (constraint 5) and ensure that when white_block_1 is not on the table (when we pick it up), blue_block_3 is either on white_block_2 or the table.

So, let's try integrating both parts.

Plan outline:

Steps to satisfy constraint 5 (blue_block_3 on white_block_2):

1. unstack blue_block_3 black_block_1 → hold blue_block_3.

2. stack blue_block_3 white_block_2 → now blue_block_3 is on white_block_2. Constraint 5 is satisfied.

Steps to handle constraint 3 and 4:

3. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_2 → wait, no. Because white_block_2 is under blue_block_3 now. So we can't unstack white_block_2 unless we remove blue_block_3 first.

So:

3. unstack blue_block_3 white_block_2 → hold blue_block_3.

4. putdown blue_block_3 → now blue_block_3 is on the table.

5. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_2 → hold white_block_2.

6. stack white_block_2 white_block_1 → now white_block_1 has a block on top (satisfies constraint 3). Before this step, we held white_block_2 (step 5), which satisfies constraint 4.

7. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1 → hold white_block_2.

8. stack white_block_2 blue_block_2 → put it back.

9. pickup blue_block_3 → from the table.

10. stack blue_block_3 white_block_2 → to satisfy constraint 5 again (since after step 4, blue_block_3 was on the table, but step 10 puts it back on white_block_2).

Now, after all this, the goal is to hold white_block_1. So:

11. pickup white_block_1 → but wait, after step 6, white_block_1 has white_block_2 on top, then after step 7, it's clear again. So after step 8, white_block_1 is on the table and clear. So step 11 is possible.

But this seems very long. Is there a shorter way?

Alternatively, after step 6 (stack white_block_2 on white_block_1), we can leave it there, but then to pickup white_block_1, we need to unstack white_block_2 first. So steps:

After step 6, white_block_1 has white_block_2 on top. So to pickup white_block_1, we need to unstack white_block_2 from white_block_1. But that requires that white_block_2 is clear, which it is (since it's the top block). So:

7. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1 → hold white_block_2.

8. putdown white_block_2 → on the table.

9. pickup white_block_1 → now holding it. Goal achieved.

But during this plan, when do we handle blue_block_3?

In step 1 and 2, we stacked blue_block_3 on white_block_2 (satisfying constraint 5). Then, in step 3 and 4, we unstacked it and put it on the table, but then in step 9, when we pickup white_block_1, white_block_1 is not on the table (since we're holding it). At that point (state s), we need to check constraint 2: in state s (or after), blue_block_3 must be on white_block_2 or the table. But after step 4, blue_block_3 is on the table. So in state s (step 9), blue_block_3 is on the table, which satisfies constraint 2. So that's okay.

But we also need to ensure that blue_block_3 is on white_block_2 in at least one state (constraint 5), which was done in step 2.

So let's outline the steps:

1. unstack blue_block_3 black_block_1 → hold blue_block_3.

2. stack blue_block_3 white_block_2 → blue_block_3 on white_block_2 (satisfies constraint 5).

3. unstack blue_block_3 white_block_2 → hold blue_block_3.

4. putdown blue_block_3 → now on table.

5. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_2 → hold white_block_2.

6. stack white_block_2 white_block_1 → white_block_1 now has a block on top (satisfies constraint 3).

7. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1 → hold white_block_2.

8. putdown white_block_2 → on table.

9. pickup white_block_1 → goal achieved.

Now, let's check the constraints:

- Constraint 1: white_block_1 is not on the table in step 9 (when held). Satisfied.

- Constraint 2: In step 9, white_block_1 is not on table. Check blue_block_3's state: it's on the table (step 4), so condition holds.

- Constraint 3: In step 6, white_block_1 has white_block_2 on top. Satisfied.

- Constraint 4: In step 6, white_block_1 is not clear. The earlier state where arm held white_block_2 is step 5. So satisfied.

- Constraint 5: In step 2, blue_block_3 is on white_block_2. Satisfied.

But this plan has 9 steps. Is there a shorter way?

Let's see if we can avoid some steps.

Alternative approach:

What if after stacking blue_block_3 on white_block_2 (step 2), we don't move it again. Then, when we pick up white_block_1, blue_block_3 is on white_block_2, which satisfies constraint 2.

But how do we then stack something on white_block_1? Because white_block_2 is under blue_block_3, so we can't unstack white_block_2 unless we first unstack blue_block_3.

Alternatively, perhaps we can stack another block on white_block_1. For example, use brown_block_1.

Plan steps:

1. unstack blue_block_3 black_block_1 → hold.

2. stack blue_block_3 white_block_2 → satisfies constraint 5.

3. pickup brown_block_1 (it's on table and clear).

4. stack brown_block_1 white_block_1 → now white_block_1 has a block on top (satisfies constraint 3). But before this step, we need to have held white_block_2 (constraint 4). However, we haven't held white_block_2 in this plan, so this violates constraint 4.

So that's no good. So we need to have held white_block_2 before stacking on white_block_1.

So perhaps the earlier approach is necessary.

Wait, another idea: After stacking blue_block_3 on white_block_2 (step 2), white_block_2 is under blue_block_3. So to stack something on white_block_1, maybe we can use blue_block_3 again. But after step 2, blue_block_3 is on white_block_2. To stack it on white_block_1, we'd need to unstack it, but that would require steps.

But let's see:

1. unstack blue_block_3 black_block_1 → hold.

2. stack blue_block_3 white_block_2 → satisfies 5.

3. unstack blue_block_3 white_block_2 → hold.

4. stack blue_block_3 white_block_1 → now white_block_1 has blue_block_3 on top (satisfies constraint 3). Before this, did we hold white_block_2? No. So this violates constraint 4.

Thus, we need to use a different block to stack on white_block_1, and ensure that before stacking, we held white_block_2.

So the earlier plan where we move white_block_2 onto white_block_1 and then back seems necessary.

But maybe there's a shorter path.

Alternative plan:

1. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_2 → hold.

2. stack white_block_2 white_block_1 → now white_block_1 has a block on top (constraint 3). Also, we held white_block_2 (step 1), which satisfies constraint 4.

3. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1 → hold.

4. putdown white_block_2 → back on table.

5. pickup white_block_1 → goal.

But what about the blue_block_3 constraints? In this plan, blue_block_3 is still on black_block_1. So when we pick up white_block_1 (step 5), the state s where white_block_1 is not on the table requires that blue_block_3 is on white_block_2 or table. But it's on black_block_1, so constraint 2 is violated.

Thus, this plan fails constraint 2.

Therefore, we need to move blue_block_3.

So integrating the necessary steps:

1. unstack blue_block_3 black_block_1 → hold.

2. stack blue_block_3 white_block_2 → satisfies 5.

3. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_2 → wait, white_block_2 is under blue_block_3. So we can't unstack white_block_2 unless we first unstack blue_block_3.

So:

3. unstack blue_block_3 white_block_2 → hold.

4. putdown blue_block_3 → on table.

5. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_2 → hold.

6. stack white_block_2 white_block_1 → satisfies 3 and 4.

7. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1 → hold.

8. stack white_block_2 blue_block_2 → put back.

9. pickup blue_block_3 → from table.

10. stack blue_block_3 white_block_2 → back to satisfy constraint 5.

11. pickup white_block_1 → goal.

But this is even longer. So perhaps the minimal steps are the earlier plan with 9 steps.

Wait, let's count again:

Original plan steps:

1. unstack blue_block_3 black_block_1

2. stack blue_block_3 white_block_2

3. unstack blue_block_3 white_block_2

4. putdown blue_block_3

5. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_2

6. stack white_block_2 white_block_1

7. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1

8. putdown white_block_2

9. pickup white_block_1

That's 9 steps. Is there a way to optimize this?

Wait, after step 2, blue_block_3 is on white_block_2. Then in step 3, we unstack it and put it down (steps 3-4). Then steps 5-8 involve moving white_block_2 onto white_block_1 and back. Then step 9 picks up white_block_1.

But what if instead of moving white_block_2, we use another block to stack on white_block_1, like brown_block_1, which is on the table. But then constraint 4 requires that before stacking on white_block_1, we held white_block_2. So we have to hold white_block_2 at some point before.

So even if we use brown_block_1 to stack on white_block_1, we still need to have held white_block_2 before. Which means we have to pick up white_block_2 at some point.

So perhaps that doesn't save steps.

Alternatively, can we hold white_block_2 while moving blue_block_3?

Wait, let's try:

1. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_2 → hold.

2. putdown white_block_2 → on table. Now, white_block_2 is clear on the table.

Now, we've held white_block_2 (satisfies constraint 4's requirement for when we stack something on white_block_1).

3. unstack blue_block_3 black_block_1 → hold.

4. stack blue_block_3 white_block_2 → now white_block_2 is under blue_block_3. Satisfies constraint 5.

5. pickup brown_block_1 → clear on table.

6. stack brown_block_1 white_block_1 → now white_block_1 is not clear (satisfies constraint 3).

7. unstack brown_block_1 white_block_1 → hold.

8. putdown brown_block_1 → back on table.

9. pickup white_block_1 → goal.

Now, check constraints:

- Constraint 1: white_block_1 is not on table in step 9. Yes.

- Constraint 2: In step 9, blue_block_3 is on white_block_2 (from step 4). So condition holds.

- Constraint 3: step 6 has white_block_1 with brown_block_1 on top.

- Constraint 4: step 6 (stacking on white_block_1) must have held white_block_2 earlier. Yes, step 1.

- Constraint 5: step 4.

So this plan has 9 steps again. Wait, but steps:

1. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_2

2. putdown white_block_2

3. unstack blue_block_3 black_block_1

4. stack blue_block_3 white_block_2

5. pickup brown_block_1

6. stack brown_block_1 white_block_1

7. unstack brown_block_1 white_block_1

8. putdown brown_block_1

9. pickup white_block_1

This is 9 steps. But maybe there's a shorter way.

Alternatively, can we stack blue_block_3 on white_block_2 after stacking brown_block_1 on white_block_1?

But then we have to ensure that when we pickup white_block_1 (final step), blue_block_3 is either on white_block_2 or table. Let's see:

Plan:

1. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_2 → hold.

2. putdown white_block_2 → on table.

3. pickup brown_block_1 → hold.

4. stack brown_block_1 white_block_1 → white_block_1 has block on top.

5. unstack brown_block_1 white_block_1 → hold.

6. putdown brown_block_1 → back on table.

7. unstack blue_block_3 black_block_1 → hold.

8. stack blue_block_3 white_block_2 → satisfies constraint 5.

9. pickup white_block_1 → goal.

Check constraints:

- Constraint 1: step 9 holds white_block_1, not on table. Yes.

- Constraint 2: in step 9, blue_block_3 is on white_block_2 (step 8). So condition holds.

- Constraint 3: step 4 has block on white_block_1.

- Constraint 4: before step 4, we held white_block_2 in step 1. Yes.

- Constraint 5: step 8.

This plan has 9 steps. Same as before.

But perhaps there's a shorter way.

Wait, in this plan, after step 4 (stack brown_block_1 on white_block_1), we unstack it in step 5 and put it back. Then move blue_block_3. But what if we don't unstack brown_block_1 until after moving blue_block_3?

Alternative:

1. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_2 → hold.

2. putdown white_block_2 → on table.

3. pickup brown_block_1 → hold.

4. stack brown_block_1 white_block_1 → step satisfies constraint 3.

5. unstack blue_block_3 black_block_1 → hold.

6. stack blue_block_3 white_block_2 → step satisfies constraint 5.

7. unstack brown_block_1 white_block_1 → hold.

8. putdown brown_block_1 → on table.

9. pickup white_block_1 → goal.

Now, this is 9 steps again. No shorter.

But maybe some steps can be combined. For example, after stacking brown_block_1 on white_block_1, can we move blue_block_3 and then unstack brown_block_1? But that's still the same number of steps.

Another idea: Can we use the same block to both satisfy constraint 5 and 3?

For example, stack blue_block_3 on white_block_1, then move it to white_block_2.

But let's see:

1. unstack blue_block_3 black_block_1 → hold.

2. stack blue_block_3 white_block_1 → satisfies constraint 3.

3. unstack blue_block_3 white_block_1 → hold.

4. stack blue_block_3 white_block_2 → satisfies constraint 5.

5. pickup white_block_1 → goal.

But check constraints:

- Constraint 4: when we stacked blue_block_3 on white_block_1 (step 2), we need to have held white_block_2 before that. But in this plan, we never held white_block_2. So constraint 4 is violated.

So this doesn't work.

Another approach: Use white_block_2 as the block stacked on white_block_1.

Plan:

1. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_2 → hold.

2. stack white_block_2 white_block_1 → satisfies constraint 3.

3. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1 → hold.

4. stack white_block_2 blue_block_2 → back.

5. unstack blue_block_3 black_block_1 → hold.

6. stack blue_block_3 white_block_2 → satisfies constraint 5.

7. pickup white_block_1 → goal.

Check constraints:

- Constraint 1: step 7 holds white_block_1.

- Constraint 2: in step 7, blue_block_3 is on white_block_2. Satisfies.

- Constraint 3: step 2.

- Constraint 4: step 2 (stacking on white_block_1) requires held white_block_2 before. Yes, step 1.

- Constraint 5: step 6.

This plan has 7 steps. That's better.

Let's verify each action's preconditions:

1. unstack white_block_2 blue_block_2: possible because white_block_2 is on blue_block_2, clear, and arm is empty.

2. stack white_block_2 white_block_1: arm is holding white_block_2, white_block_1 is clear (initially on table and clear). Yes.

3. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1: white_block_2 is on white_block_1 and clear, arm is empty. So possible.

4. stack white_block_2 blue_block_2: arm holds white_block_2, blue_block_2 is clear (since step 1 unstacked white_block_2 from it, and no one else stacked anything on it). Yes.

5. unstack blue_block_3 black_block_1: blue_block_3 is on black_block_1 and clear, arm is empty. Yes.

6. stack blue_block_3 white_block_2: arm holds blue_block_3, white_block_2 is clear (after step 4, white_block_2 is on blue_block_2. Wait, no: after step 4, white_block_2 is stacked back on blue_block_2, so white_block_2 is clear? No. After step 4, white_block_2 is on blue_block_2. So to stack blue_block_3 on white_block_2 in step 6, white_block_2 must be clear. But after step 4, white_block_2 is on blue_block_2 and is clear. Yes. So step 6 is possible.

7. pickup white_block_1: it's on table and clear. Arm is empty. Yes.

This plan seems valid and has 7 steps. Let's check all constraints again:

- Constraint 1: white_block_1 is not on table in step 7. Yes.

- Constraint 2: in step 7, blue_block_3 is on white_block_2 (step 6). Yes.

- Constraint 3: step 2. Yes.

- Constraint 4: in step 2 (white_block_1 has white_block_2 on top), the arm held white_block_2 in step 1. Yes.

- Constraint 5: step 6. Yes.

This plan seems to satisfy all constraints and has only 7 steps, which is better than the previous 9-step plans. So this is a better candidate.

But wait, after step 4, white_block_2 is back on blue_block_2. Then in step 6, stacking blue_block_3 on white_block_2 is possible because white_block_2 is clear (since after step 4, white_block_2 is on blue_block_2 and no blocks are on top of it). So yes.

This plan seems to work and is shorter. Let's write it out:

Action list:

unstack white_block_2 blue_block_2

stack white_block_2 white_block_1

unstack white_block_2 white_block_1

stack white_block_2 blue_block_2

unstack blue_block_3 black_block_1

stack blue_block_3 white_block_2

pickup white_block_1

This is 7 actions. Let's verify each step's effects:

1. unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_2: arm holds white_block_2, blue_block_2 becomes clear.

2. stack white_block_2 on white_block_1: white_block_2 is on white_block_1, white_block_1 is not clear, arm is empty.

3. unstack white_block_2 from white_block_1: arm holds white_block_2, white_block_1 becomes clear.

4. stack white_block_2 on blue_block_2: white_block_2 is back on blue_block_2, arm is empty.

5. unstack blue_block_3 from black_block_1: arm holds blue_block_3, black_block_1 becomes clear.

6. stack blue_block_3 on white_block_2: blue_block_3 is on white_block_2, arm is empty.

7. pickup white_block_1: arm holds white_block_1.

This plan meets all the constraints and is shorter. Therefore, this is the optimal plan.
