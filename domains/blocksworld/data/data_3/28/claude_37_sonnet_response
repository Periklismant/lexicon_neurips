Alright, let's analyze this problem:

I need to achieve the goal where I'm holding white_block_1. There are also several constraints I need to satisfy along the way.

First, let's understand the initial state:
- blue_block_1 is on the table and clear
- black_block_1 is on the table with blue_block_3 on top of it
- blue_block_2 is on the table with white_block_2 on top of it
- blue_block_3 is on top of black_block_1 and is clear
- white_block_1 is on the table and clear
- white_block_2 is on top of blue_block_2 and is clear
- brown_block_1 is on the table and clear
- I am not holding any block

Now, let's understand the constraints:
1. At some point, white_block_1 should not be on the table.
2. If white_block_1 is not on the table, then at that point or later, either blue_block_3 is on top of white_block_2 or blue_block_3 is on the table.
3. At some point, there should be a block on top of white_block_1.
4. Before placing a block on top of white_block_1, I must hold white_block_2 at some point.
5. At some point, blue_block_3 should be on top of white_block_2.

So, I need to plan my actions to achieve the goal while satisfying all these constraints.

Here's my approach:
1. First, I need to satisfy the constraint that I should have held white_block_2 before I put a block on top of white_block_1.
2. I need to place blue_block_3 on top of white_block_2 at some point.
3. I need to ensure that white_block_1 is not on the table and there's a block on top of it at some point.
4. Finally, I need to achieve the goal of holding white_block_1.

Let's design a plan:

1. First, I'll pick up white_block_2 from blue_block_2 (this satisfies constraint 4).
2. I'll put white_block_2 on the table.
3. I'll unstack blue_block_3 from black_block_1.
4. I'll stack blue_block_3 on white_block_2 (this satisfies constraint 5).
5. Now, I'll pick up a block (e.g., blue_block_1) and stack it on white_block_1 (this makes white_block_1 not clear, satisfying constraint 3).
6. I'll unstack blue_block_1 from white_block_1.
7. I'll stack white_block_1 on another block (e.g., brown_block_1) (this ensures white_block_1 is not on the table, satisfying constraint 1).
8. At this point, blue_block_3 is on top of white_block_2, which satisfies constraint 2.
9. I'll unstack white_block_1 from brown_block_1, achieving the goal of holding white_block_1.

Let's formalize this plan with the provided actions:

```
unstack white_block_2 blue_block_2
putdown white_block_2
unstack blue_block_3 black_block_1
stack blue_block_3 white_block_2
pickup blue_block_1
stack blue_block_1 white_block_1
unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1
putdown blue_block_1
pickup white_block_1
stack white_block_1 brown_block_1
unstack white_block_1 brown_block_1
```

Let me verify that this plan achieves the goal and satisfies all constraints:

Goal: "you are holding white_block_1"
This is achieved after the last action, unstack white_block_1 brown_block_1, which results in holding white_block_1.

Constraint 1: "white_block_1 is not on the table" must hold in at least one state.
This is achieved when I stack white_block_1 on brown_block_1.

Constraint 2: "If white_block_1 is not on the table, then blue_block_3 is on top of white_block_2 or blue_block_3 is on the table"
When white_block_1 is not on the table (after I stack it on brown_block_1), blue_block_3 is on top of white_block_2, so this constraint is satisfied.

Constraint 3: "there is a block on top of white_block_1" must hold in at least one state.
This is achieved when I stack blue_block_1 on white_block_1.

Constraint 4: "If there is a block on top of white_block_1, then there must be an earlier state in which 'you are holding white_block_2'"
I hold white_block_2 (after unstacking it from blue_block_2) before I place a block on top of white_block_1, so this constraint is satisfied.

Constraint 5: "blue_block_3 is on top of white_block_2" must hold in at least one state.
This is achieved when I stack blue_block_3 on white_block_2.

All constraints are satisfied, and the goal is achieved. However, let me double check I haven't missed anything or that there's a more optimal (shorter) plan.

I just realized I don't need to put white_block_2 on the table. I can directly stack it on another block. Let me revise the plan:

```
unstack white_block_2 blue_block_2
stack white_block_2 white_block_1 # This satisfies constraint 3 and 4
unstack blue_block_3 black_block_1
stack blue_block_3 white_block_2 # This satisfies constraint 5
unstack white_block_2 white_block_1
stack white_block_2 brown_block_1
pickup white_block_1 # This satisfies constraint 1
# blue_block_3 is on top of white_block_2, so constraint 2 is satisfied
```

But wait, I can't pick up white_block_1 if white_block_2 is on top of it. I need to remove white_block_2 first. Let me revise again.

Hmm, I think there's a problem with my understanding of constraint 4. It says:

"If expression 'there is a block on top of white_block_1, i.e., white_block_1 is not clear' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'you are holding white_block_2'"

This means that before I place a block on top of white_block_1, I should have held white_block_2 at some earlier point in the plan. It's a temporal constraint, not a direct precondition.

Let's revise the plan:

```
unstack white_block_2 blue_block_2 # After this, I'm holding white_block_2, which satisfies part of constraint 4
putdown white_block_2
pickup blue_block_1
stack blue_block_1 white_block_1 # This satisfies constraint 3, and constraint 4 is now fulfilled
unstack blue_block_1 white_block_1
putdown blue_block_1
unstack blue_block_3 black_block_1
stack blue_block_3 white_block_2 # This satisfies constraint 5
pickup white_block_1 # This satisfies constraint 1
# blue_block_3 is on top of white_block_2, so constraint 2 is satisfied
```

But, I just realized again there's an issue with constraint 1. It requires white_block_1 to not be on the table. Just picking it up temporarily satisfies this, but it might be intended that white_block_1 should be stacked on another block at some point.

Let's revise once more:

```
unstack white_block_2 blue_block_2 # After this, I'm holding white_block_2, which satisfies part of constraint 4
stack white_block_2 blue_block_1
pickup white_block_1 # This satisfies constraint 1
stack white_block_1 black_block_1
pickup brown_block_1
stack brown_block_1 white_block_1 # This satisfies constraint 3, and constraint 4 is now fulfilled
unstack blue_block_3 black_block_1 # This action might not be valid, as black_block_1 has white_block_1 stacked on it. Let me re-evaluate.
```

Hmm, I think my approach is getting a bit convoluted. Let's take a step back and reconsider.

Constraints:
1. white_block_1 should not be on the table at some point.
2. If white_block_1 is not on the table, then blue_block_3 is either on top of white_block_2 or on the table.
3. There should be a block on top of white_block_1 at some point.
4. Before placing a block on top of white_block_1, I must hold white_block_2.
5. blue_block_3 should be on top of white_block_2 at some point.

Let's simplify the plan:

1. First, unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_2. This satisfies the sub-constraint from constraint 4.
2. Stack white_block_2 on any other clear block, let's say blue_block_1. This ensures that white_block_2 is not on the table.
3. Unstack blue_block_3 from black_block_1.
4. Stack blue_block_3 on top of white_block_1. This satisfies constraint 3.
5. Unstack blue_block_3 from white_block_1.
6. Stack blue_block_3 on top of white_block_2. This satisfies constraint 5.
7. Pickup white_block_1. This satisfies the goal. It also momentarily satisfies constraint 1 and, at this point, blue_block_3 is on top of white_block_2, satisfying constraint 2.

Let's see if this plan works:

```
unstack white_block_2 blue_block_2
stack white_block_2 blue_block_1
unstack blue_block_3 black_block_1
stack blue_block_3 white_block_1
unstack blue_block_3 white_block_1
stack blue_block_3 white_block_2
pickup white_block_1
```

Let's verify:

Goal: "you are holding white_block_1"
This is achieved after the last action, pickup white_block_1.

Constraint 1: "white_block_1 is not on the table" must hold in at least one state.
This is achieved when I pick up white_block_1.

Constraint 2: "If white_block_1 is not on the table, then blue_block_3 is on top of white_block_2 or blue_block_3 is on the table"
When I pick up white_block_1, which makes it not on the table, blue_block_3 is on top of white_block_2, satisfying this constraint.

Constraint 3: "there is a block on top of white_block_1" must hold in at least one state.
This is achieved when I stack blue_block_3 on white_block_1.

Constraint 4: "If there is a block on top of white_block_1, then there must be an earlier state in which 'you are holding white_block_2'"
I hold white_block_2 (after unstacking it from blue_block_2) before I place blue_block_3 on top of white_block_1, so this constraint is satisfied.

Constraint 5: "blue_block_3 is on top of white_block_2" must hold in at least one state.
This is achieved when I stack blue_block_3 on white_block_2.

All constraints are satisfied, and the goal is achieved. This plan seems optimal (shortest) for the constraints given.

Let me double check for any potential issues:

I unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_2 and stack it on blue_block_1. Both actions are valid.
I unstack blue_block_3 from black_block_1 and stack it on white_block_1. Both actions are valid.
I unstack blue_block_3 from white_block_1 and stack it on white_block_2. Both actions are valid.
I pickup white_block_1. This action is valid as white_block_1 is on the table and clear.

Actually, let me think this through one more time. I'm unclear about the wording of constraint 1. It says that "the following expression must hold in at least one state: 'white_block_1 is not on the table'". This means that at some point, white_block_1 should not be on the table. This can happen in two ways:
1. white_block_1 is picked up by the robot arm.
2. white_block_1 is stacked on another block.

Since I need to achieve the goal of holding white_block_1, and one way to satisfy constraint 1 is to pick it up, I'll go with that approach.

For constraint 2, it says that if white_block_1 is not on the table, then blue_block_3 should be either on top of white_block_2 or on the table. This means that when I'm holding white_block_1 (which is one way for it to not be on the table), blue_block_3 should be either on top of white_block_2 or on the table. Since constraint 5 requires blue_block_3 to be on top of white_block_2 at some point, I'll use that to satisfy constraint 2.

For constraint 3, it says that at some point, there should be a block on top of white_block_1. This is a clear requirement. I'll place a block (e.g., blue_block_3) on top of white_block_1 at some point.

Constraint 4 is a temporal constraint. It says that before placing a block on top of white_block_1, I must hold white_block_2 at some earlier point. This means that the action of holding white_block_2 must precede the action of placing a block on top of white_block_1.

For constraint 5, it says that blue_block_3 should be on top of white_block_2 at some point. This is a clear requirement.

With these understandings, let's revisit the plan:

```
unstack white_block_2 blue_block_2 # This satisfies part of constraint 4
stack white_block_2 blue_block_1 # (this is an arbitrary choice, could stack it anywhere)
unstack blue_block_3 black_block_1
stack blue_block_3 white_block_1 # This satisfies constraint 3, and constraint 4 is now fulfilled
unstack blue_block_3 white_block_1
stack blue_block_3 white_block_2 # This satisfies constraint 5
pickup white_block_1 # This satisfies constraint 1 and the goal, and constraint 2 is satisfied because blue_block_3 is on top of white_block_2
```

This plan seems to satisfy all constraints and achieve the goal. The constraints are carefully ordered to ensure they are all fulfilled correctly. However, I'm not seeing any alternative paths that might be shorter. Let's check.

Actually, I think I could shorten the plan. Instead of first stacking white_block_2 on blue_block_1, I could directly stack it on white_block_1. This would save two steps (the stacking on blue_block_1 and the later unstacking). Here's the revised plan:

```
unstack white_block_2 blue_block_2
stack white_block_2 white_block_1 # This satisfies constraint 3, and since I held white_block_2, constraint 4 is also fulfilled
unstack blue_block_3 black_block_1
stack blue_block_3 white_block_2 # This satisfies constraint 5
unstack white_block_2 white_block_1 # This would temporarily satisfy constraint 1, but I need to ensure blue_block_3 is either on white_block_2 or on the table for constraint 2
# But wait, blue_block_3 is on white_block_2, so constraint 2 is satisfied
stack white_block_2 blue_block_1 # This is just to make white_block_1 accessible
pickup white_block_1 # This satisfies the goal and constraint 1
```

This plan is longer, so I'll stick with the former.

Actually, let me reconsider the whole thing from the beginning.

Initial state:
- blue_block_1 is on the table and clear
- black_block_1 is on the table with blue_block_3 on top of it
- blue_block_2 is on the table with white_block_2 on top of it
- blue_block_3 is on top of black_block_1 and is clear
- white_block_1 is on the table and clear
- white_block_2 is on top of blue_block_2 and is clear
- brown_block_1 is on the table and clear
- I am not holding any block

Goal:
- holding white_block_1

Constraints:
1. At some point, white_block_1 should not be on the table.
2. If white_block_1 is not on the table, then blue_block_3 should be either on top of white_block_2 or on the table at that point or later.
3. At some point, there should be a block on top of white_block_1.
4. Before placing a block on top of white_block_1, I must hold white_block_2 at some point.
5. At some point, blue_block_3 should be on top of white_block_2.

I think the quickest plan to achieve all of this would be:

1. Unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_2. This satisfies part of constraint 4.
2. Stack white_block_2 on white_block_1. This satisfies constraint 3, and constraint 4 is now fulfilled.
3. Unstack blue_block_3 from black_block_1.
4. Stack blue_block_3 on white_block_2. This satisfies constraint 5.
5. Unstack white_block_2 from white_block_1. At this point, white_block_1 is momentarily not clear, but is on the table. A transition to a state where white_block_1 is not on the table (constraint 1) will occur when I pick it up.
6. Pickup white_block_1. This satisfies constraint 1 and the goal.

Now, for constraint 2, when white_block_1 is not on the table (i.e., when I'm holding it), blue_block_3 is on top of white_block_2, satisfying this constraint.

Let's formalize this plan with the provided actions:

```
unstack white_block_2 blue_block_2
stack white_block_2 white_block_1
unstack blue_block_3 black_block_1
stack blue_block_3 white_block_2
unstack white_block_2 white_block_1
pickup white_block_1
```

This plan achieves the goal and satisfies all constraints in the shortest possible way.

Let's double-check:

Constraint 1: ✓ (white_block_1 is not on the table when it's picked up)
Constraint 2: ✓ (blue_block_3 is on white_block_2 when white_block_1 is not on the table)
Constraint 3: ✓ (white_block_2 is on top of white_block_1 at one point)
Constraint 4: ✓ (white_block_2 is held before placing it on white_block_1)
Constraint 5: ✓ (blue_block_3 is on top of white_block_2 at one point)
Goal: ✓ (holding white_block_1 in the end)

Actually, now that I think about it, let's ensure that we approach constraint 1 and 2 correctly. Constraint 1 says white_block_1 should not be on the table at some point, which could be if we pick it up or stack it on something else. Constraint 2 says that if white_block_1 is not on the table, blue_block_3 should be either on white_block_2 or on the table.

So, if I'm holding white_block_1 (which means it's not on the table), blue_block_3 should be either on white_block_2 or on the table.

In the plan I've been developing:
At step 5, I unstack white_block_2 from white_block_1, making white_block_1 clear. But white_block_1 is still on the table. At this point, blue_block_3 is on white_block_2, which doesn't conflict with constraints.
At step 6, I pick up white_block_1, making it not on the table. At this point, blue_block_3 is on white_block_2, which satisfies constraint 2.

So the constraints are satisfied correctly.

I think the plan is optimal and valid. Let's finalize it.

```
unstack white_block_2 blue_block_2
stack white_block_2 white_block_1
unstack blue_block_3 black_block_1
stack blue_block_3 white_block_2
unstack white_block_2 white_block_1
pickup white_block_1
```

Let me trace through the execution of this plan to verify its correctness:

Initial state:
- blue_block_1 is on the table and clear
- black_block_1 is on the table with blue_block_3 on top of it
- blue_block_2 is on the table with white_block_2 on top of it
- blue_block_3 is on top of black_block_1 and is clear
- white_block_1 is on the table and clear
- white_block_2 is on top of blue_block_2 and is clear
- brown_block_1 is on the table and clear
- I am not holding any block

1. After "unstack white_block_2 blue_block_2":
   - I am holding white_block_2
   - blue_block_2 is clear
   - white_block_2 is no longer on top of blue_block_2
   - blue_block_1, black_block_1, blue_block_2, white_block_1, and brown_block_1 are on the table
   - blue_block_3 is on top of black_block_1
   - blue_block_1, blue_block_2, blue_block_3, white_block_1, and brown_block_1 are clear

2. After "stack white_block_2 white_block_1":
   - I am not holding any block
   - white_block_2 is on top of white_block_1
   - white_block_1 is no longer clear
   - white_block_2 is clear
   - blue_block_1, black_block_1, blue_block_2, white_block_1, and brown_block_1 are on the table
   - blue_block_3 is on top of black_block_1
   - blue_block_1, blue_block_2, blue_block_3, white_block_2, and brown_block_1 are clear

3. After "unstack blue_block_3 black_block_1":
   - I am holding blue_block_3
   - black_block_1 is clear
   - blue_block_3 is no longer on top of black_block_1
   - blue_block_1, black_block_1, blue_block_2, white_block_1, and brown_block_1 are on the table
   - white_block_2 is on top of white_block_1
   - blue_block_1, blue_block_2, black_block_1, white_block_2, and brown_block_1 are clear

4. After "stack blue_block_3 white_block_2":
   - I am not holding any block
   - blue_block_3 is on top of white_block_2
   - white_block_2 is no longer clear
   - blue_block_3 is clear
   - blue_block_1, black_block_1, blue_block_2, white_block_1, and brown_block_1 are on the table
   - white_block_2 is on top of white_block_1
   - blue_block_1, blue_block_2, black_block_1, blue_block_3, and brown_block_1 are clear

5. After "unstack white_block_2 white_block_1":
   - I am holding white_block_2
   - white_block_1 is clear
   - white_block_2 is no longer on top of white_block_1
   - blue_block_3 is on top of white_block_2
   - blue_block_1, black_block_1, blue_block_2, white_block_1, and brown_block_1 are on the table
   - blue_block_1, blue_block_2, black_block_1, blue_block_3, white_block_1, and brown_block_1 are clear
   - Hmm, there's a mistake here. I can't unstack white_block_2 from white_block_1 because blue_block_3 is on top of white_block_2, making white_block_2 not clear.

This plan won't work.

Let me revise:

1. Unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_2. This satisfies part of constraint 4.
2. Stack white_block_2 on white_block_1. This satisfies constraint 3, and constraint 4 is now fulfilled.
3. Unstack blue_block_3 from black_block_1.
4. Stack blue_block_3 on blue_block_1 (arbitrary choice). This momentarily satisfies constraint 2 for the next step.
5. Pickup white_block_1. This satisfies constraint 1 and the goal. However, it's not possible to pick up white_block_1 with white_block_2 on top of it.

Alright, I need to reconsider and be more careful about the preconditions.

Let's take a different approach:

1. Unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_2. This satisfies part of constraint 4.
2. Stack white_block_2 on white_block_1. This satisfies constraint 3, and constraint 4 is now fulfilled.
3. Unstack white_block_2 from white_block_1.
4. Unstack blue_block_3 from black_block_1.
5. Stack blue_block_3 on white_block_2. This satisfies constraint 5.
6. Pickup white_block_1. This satisfies constraint 1 and the goal, and since blue_block_3 is on white_block_2, constraint 2 is also satisfied.

Let's check this plan:

```
unstack white_block_2 blue_block_2
stack white_block_2 white_block_1
unstack white_block_2 white_block_1
unstack blue_block_3 black_block_1
stack blue_block_3 white_block_2
pickup white_block_1
```

Let me trace through the execution of this revised plan:

Initial state:
- blue_block_1 is on the table and clear
- black_block_1 is on the table with blue_block_3 on top of it
- blue_block_2 is on the table with white_block_2 on top of it
- blue_block_3 is on top of black_block_1 and is clear
- white_block_1 is on the table and clear
- white_block_2 is on top of blue_block_2 and is clear
- brown_block_1 is on the table and clear
- I am not holding any block

1. After "unstack white_block_2 blue_block_2":
   - I am holding white_block_2
   - blue_block_2 is clear
   - white_block_2 is no longer on top of blue_block_2
   - Constraints met: None yet

2. After "stack white_block_2 white_block_1":
   - I am not holding any block
   - white_block_2 is on top of white_block_1
   - white_block_1 is no longer clear
   - white_block_2 is clear
   - Constraints met: 3 (there is a block on top of white_block_1), 4 (I held white_block_2 before placing it on white_block_1)

3. After "unstack white_block_2 white_block_1":
   - I am holding white_block_2
   - white_block_1 is clear
   - white_block_2 is no longer on top of white_block_1
   - Constraints met: 3, 4 (as above)

4. After "unstack blue_block_3 black_block_1":
   - Oops, I can't perform this because I'm already holding white_block_2. This invalidates my plan.

Alright, I need to correct this. Let me try once more:

1. Unstack white_block_2 from blue_block_2. This satisfies part of constraint 4.
2. Stack white_block_2 on white_block_1. This satisfies constraint 3, and constraint 4 is now fulfilled.
3. Unstack white_block_2 from white_block_1.
4. Putdown white_block_2 on the table.
5. Unstack blue_block_3 from black_block_1.
6. Stack blue_block_3 on white_block_2. This satisfies constraint 5.
7. Pickup white_block_1. This satisfies constraint 1 and the goal, and since blue_block_3 is on white_block_2, constraint 2 is also satisfied.

Let's check this plan:

```
unstack white_block_2 blue_block_2
stack white_block_2 white_block_1
unstack white_block_2 white_block_1
putdown white_block_2
unstack blue_block_3 black_block_1

   - Constraints met: 3, 4 (as above), 5 (blue_block_3 is on top of white_block_2)

7. After "pickup white_block_1":
   - I am holding white_block_1
   - white_block_1 is no longer on the table
   - Constraints met: 1 (white_block_1 is not on the table), 2 (blue_block_3 is on top of white_block_2 when white_block_1 is not on the table), 3, 4, 5 (as above)
   - Goal met: I am holding white_block_1

This plan seems to be valid and satisfies all constraints. Is it the shortest valid plan? Let's check.

Let's see if we can optimize further:

If I don't stack white_block_2 on white_block_1 and instead just place it on the table, I would save two steps (stacking and unstacking). However, this would violate constraint 3, which requires a block on top of white_block_1.

If I stack a different block on white_block_1, it would violate constraint 4, which requires me to hold white_block_2 before placing a block on white_block_1.

So, I can't see a way to shorten the plan further. I believe the plan I've provided is the shortest valid plan.

Here it is once more:

```
unstack white_block_2 blue_block_2
stack white_block_2 white_block_1
unstack white_block_2 white_block_1
putdown white_block_2
unstack blue_block_3 black_block_1
stack blue_block_3 white_block_2
pickup white_block_1
```

I'm going to re-check: this plan achieves the goal (I am holding white_block_1) and meets all constraints as traced above.

I believe this is the optimal solution.
