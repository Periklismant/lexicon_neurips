Let's analyze this problem step by step. 

First, let's understand the initial state of the world:
- white_block_1 is on the table with yellow_block_1 on top of it
- white_block_2 is on the table with green_block_1 on top of it
- orange_block_1 is on the table and is clear
- orange_block_2 is on the table and is clear
- red_block_1 is on the table and is clear
- We're not holding any block

The goal is to have yellow_block_1 on the table.

Let's consider the constraints:
1. At some point, yellow_block_1 must not be on top of white_block_1.
2. If yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1, then either white_block_2 is clear or white_block_2 is on top of green_block_1.
3. At some point, green_block_1 must not be on top of yellow_block_1.
4. If green_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_1, then orange_block_1 must be on top of white_block_2.
5. At some point, there must be a block on top of red_block_1.

Let's note that in the initial state, yellow_block_1 is on top of white_block_1, and green_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_1 (it's on top of white_block_2). So constraint 3 is already satisfied. However, according to constraint 4, since green_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_1, we need to have orange_block_1 on top of white_block_2 either now or in the future. Currently, orange_block_1 is on the table, and green_block_1 is on top of white_block_2. So we'll need to move green_block_1 off white_block_2 and then place orange_block_1 on top of white_block_2.

Let's also note that constraint 1 requires that at some point, yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1. This aligns with our goal of having yellow_block_1 on the table. Once yellow_block_1 is moved off white_block_1, constraint 2 requires that either white_block_2 is clear or white_block_2 is on top of green_block_1. In the initial state, green_block_1 is on top of white_block_2, not the other way around. So we'll need to ensure that white_block_2 is clear or rearrange the blocks to have white_block_2 on top of green_block_1.

Lastly, constraint 5 requires that at some point, there's a block on top of red_block_1. Currently, red_block_1 is clear, so we'll need to stack some block on top of it.

Now, let's construct a plan:

1. First, let's get yellow_block_1 off white_block_1:
   - unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1
   - putdown yellow_block_1

2. Now, constraint 1 is satisfied. According to constraint 2, we need to ensure that either white_block_2 is clear or white_block_2 is on top of green_block_1. Currently, green_block_1 is on top of white_block_2. So, we need to ensure that white_block_2 is clear. Let's remove green_block_1 from white_block_2:
   - unstack green_block_1 white_block_2

3. Now, we want to satisfy constraint 4 by placing orange_block_1 on top of white_block_2:
   - pickup orange_block_1
   - stack orange_block_1 white_block_2

4. Lastly, to satisfy constraint 5, we need to stack a block on top of red_block_1. We can use green_block_1 which we're currently holding:
   - putdown green_block_1 (Since we're holding it from step 2)
   - pickup green_block_1
   - stack green_block_1 red_block_1

Actually, I made a mistake. After step 2, we're holding green_block_1, so we can directly use it to satisfy constraint 5:
   - stack green_block_1 red_block_1

Let's double-check our plan:

1. unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1
2. putdown yellow_block_1
3. unstack green_block_1 white_block_2
4. stack green_block_1 red_block_1
5. pickup orange_block_1
6. stack orange_block_1 white_block_2

After executing this plan:
- yellow_block_1 is on the table (goal satisfied)
- white_block_1 is on the table and is clear
- white_block_2 is on the table with orange_block_1 on top of it
- red_block_1 is on the table with green_block_1 on top of it
- orange_block_2 is on the table and is clear
- We're not holding any block

Let's verify that all the constraints are satisfied:

1. Constraint 1: At some point (after step 1), yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1. ✓
2. Constraint 2: After yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1 (after step 1), white_block_2 is clear (after step 3). ✓
3. Constraint 3: Initially, green_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_1. ✓
4. Constraint 4: Since green_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_1, orange_block_1 is on top of white_block_2 (after step 6). ✓
5. Constraint 5: At some point (after step 4), there's a block (green_block_1) on top of red_block_1. ✓

All constraints are satisfied, and our goal is achieved. 

Actually, let me re-check the plan to ensure it's correct:

Starting state:
- white_block_1 is on the table with yellow_block_1 on top of it
- white_block_2 is on the table with green_block_1 on top of it
- orange_block_1 is on the table and is clear
- orange_block_2 is on the table and is clear
- red_block_1 is on the table and is clear
- We're not holding any block

1. unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1
   - Pre: yellow_block_1 is clear, yellow_block_1 is on top of white_block_1, we're not holding any block. ✓
   - Post: We're holding yellow_block_1, yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1, white_block_1 is clear.

2. putdown yellow_block_1
   - Pre: We're holding yellow_block_1. ✓
   - Post: yellow_block_1 is on the table, yellow_block_1 is clear, we're not holding any block.

3. unstack green_block_1 white_block_2
   - Pre: green_block_1 is clear, green_block_1 is on top of white_block_2, we're not holding any block. ✓
   - Post: We're holding green_block_1, green_block_1 is not on top of white_block_2, white_block_2 is clear.

4. stack green_block_1 red_block_1
   - Pre: We're holding green_block_1, red_block_1 is clear. ✓
   - Post: green_block_1 is on top of red_block_1, green_block_1 is clear, red_block_1 is not clear, we're not holding any block.

5. pickup orange_block_1
   - Pre: orange_block_1 is clear, orange_block_1 is on the table, we're not holding any block. ✓
   - Post: We're holding orange_block_1, orange_block_1 is not on the table.

6. stack orange_block_1 white_block_2
   - Pre: We're holding orange_block_1, white_block_2 is clear. ✓
   - Post: orange_block_1 is on top of white_block_2, orange_block_1 is clear, white_block_2 is not clear, we're not holding any block.

Final state:
- white_block_1 is on the table and is clear
- white_block_2 is on the table with orange_block_1 on top of it
- yellow_block_1 is on the table and is clear
- orange_block_2 is on the table and is clear
- red_block_1 is on the table with green_block_1 on top of it
- We're not holding any block

So, our plan satisfies the goal of having yellow_block_1 on the table. Let's double-check it against the constraints again:

1. Constraint 1: After step 1, yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1. ✓
2. Constraint 2: After yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1 (after step 1), white_block_2 is clear (after step 3). ✓
3. Constraint 3: Initially, green_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_1. ✓
4. Constraint 4: Since green_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_1, orange_block_1 is on top of white_block_2 (after step 6). ✓
5. Constraint 5: After step 4, green_block_1 is on top of red_block_1, so red_block_1 is not clear. ✓

All constraints are satisfied, and our goal is achieved. So, our plan is:

1. unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1
2. putdown yellow_block_1
3. unstack green_block_1 white_block_2
4. stack green_block_1 red_block_1
5. pickup orange_block_1
6. stack orange_block_1 white_block_2

Actually, there's one thing I'm unsure about. Let's look at constraint 4 again:

4. If expression "green_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_1" holds in some state s, then expression "orange_block_1 is on top of white_block_2" must hold at s or at some state after s.

In the initial state, green_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_1, but orange_block_1 is not on top of white_block_2. So, we need to ensure that orange_block_1 is on top of white_block_2 at some point.

Actually, that's consistent with our plan. After executing our plan, orange_block_1 is on top of white_block_2 (after step 6). So, constraint 4 is satisfied.

Checking our plan once more:

1. unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1
2. putdown yellow_block_1
3. unstack green_block_1 white_block_2
4. stack green_block_1 red_block_1
5. pickup orange_block_1
6. stack orange_block_1 white_block_2

This plan satisfies the goal and all constraints. Let's verify that it's optimal, meaning no shorter plan will achieve the goal and satisfy all constraints.

For the goal: To have yellow_block_1 on the table, we minimally need to execute steps 1 and 2.

For constraint 1: Satisfied after step 1.
For constraint 2: Requires white_block_2 to be clear (or on top of green_block_1), which is achieved after step 3.
For constraint 3: Already satisfied in the initial state.
For constraint 4: Requires orange_block_1 to be on top of white_block_2, which is achieved with steps 5 and 6.
For constraint 5: Requires a block to be on top of red_block_1, which is achieved with step 4.

Given these requirements, it's clear that we need at least 6 actions to satisfy both the goal and all constraints. Hence, our plan is optimal.

So, our final 6-step plan is:

1. unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1
2. putdown yellow_block_1
3. unstack green_block_1 white_block_2
4. stack green_block_1 red_block_1
5. pickup orange_block_1
6. stack orange_block_1 white_block_2
