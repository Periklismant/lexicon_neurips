Okay, let's tackle this Blocksworld planning problem. Hmm, the goal is to have yellow_block_1 on the table. Let's start by looking at the initial state. 

In the initial setup, yellow_block_1 is on top of white_block_1, and it's clear. So to get yellow_block_1 to the table, I need to unstack it from white_block_1. But wait, the constraints might complicate things. Let me check the constraints first.

The first constraint says that "yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" must hold in at least one state. Well, since our goal is to have yellow_block_1 on the table, which means it's not on white_block_1, that constraint will naturally be satisfied once we unstack it. But there's another part: if that condition is true in a state, then either white_block_2 is clear or white_block_2 is on green_block_1. 

Wait, initially, white_block_2 has green_block_1 on top. So green_block_1 is on white_block_2 and is clear. So white_block_2 is not clear because green_block_1 is on it. If we unstack yellow_block_1, making it not on white_block_1, then we need to ensure that either white_block_2 becomes clear or white_block_2 is on green_block_1. But white_block_2 is under green_block_1. To make white_block_2 clear, we'd have to remove green_block_1. Alternatively, putting white_block_2 on green_block_1 is impossible since blocks can't be placed under. So maybe we need to move green_block_1 off white_block_2 to make white_block_2 clear. But how does that tie into the goal?

The second constraint is that "green_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_1" must hold in some state. Since green_block_1 is initially on white_block_2, not on yellow_block_1. So this condition is already true in the initial state. Wait, but the constraint says "must hold in at least one state". So maybe that's already satisfied. Wait, but the initial state has green_block_1 on white_block_2, so the expression "green_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_1" is true. So that condition is already met in the initial state. But then the implication is that if that condition holds in some state s (including the initial state), then in s or a later state, orange_block_1 must be on top of white_block_2.

Wait, so because the initial state already satisfies "green_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_1", then we must have orange_block_1 on white_block_2 at some point after. Because the constraint says if the antecedent holds in s, the consequent must hold in s or after. So even if the antecedent is already true initially, the consequent must be achieved at some point. So we need to have orange_block_1 on white_block_2 in the plan.

Then there's the third constraint that red_block_1 must not be clear in at least one state. So we need to put some block on top of red_block_1.

Okay, so putting all this together, the plan must:

1. Get yellow_block_1 to the table (the main goal).
2. Ensure that at some point, orange_block_1 is placed on white_block_2.
3. Place a block on red_block_1 to make it not clear.
4. Also, when we unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1 (which makes the first constraint's antecedent true), then the consequent about white_block_2 must hold either immediately or later. Since after unsticking yellow_block_1, white_block_2 is still under green_block_1 (so not clear). So we need to make white_block_2 clear or have white_block_2 on green_block_1. But white_block_2 is on the table with green_block_1 on it. To make white_block_2 clear, we need to remove green_block_1. Alternatively, putting white_block_2 on top of green_block_1 isn't possible because white_block_2 is on the table. So perhaps moving green_block_1 off white_block_2 would make white_block_2 clear. Then, after that, white_block_2 is clear, satisfying the consequent. But when?

Wait, let's outline the steps.

First, to get yellow_block_1 to the table, the first step would be to unstack it from white_block_1. But wait, unstack requires that the block is on top of another and you're not holding anything. So the initial state allows that. So unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1. Then we can put it down. But putting it down would require putdown. Wait, no. When you unstack, you end up holding the block. So after unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1, we can then put it down. But that would achieve the goal. But then we have to satisfy the constraints.

But wait, the constraints:

1. When we unstack yellow_block_1, the first constraint's antecedent (yellow not on white1) becomes true. Then we need to ensure that in that state or after, white_block_2 is clear or white_block2 is on green1. But white_block2 is under green1, so it's not clear. So we need to make white_block2 clear. To do that, we need to move green_block_1 off white_block2. But moving green_block_1 would require picking it up. So perhaps after moving yellow to the table, we need to handle green.

But the main goal is just yellow on table. So the minimal steps would be unstack yellow, putdown yellow. But then the constraints must be considered.

Wait, but in the plan, after unsticking yellow, we have to ensure that the consequent of the first constraint is met. So if after unstacking yellow, white_block2 is not clear (since green is on it), then we need to make sure that either white_block2 becomes clear or white_block2 is on green_block1. But white_block2 is on the table, so the second part (white_block2 on green_block1) is impossible. So we must make white_block2 clear. Which requires moving green_block1.

But moving green_block1 would involve unstacking it from white_block2. Then putting it somewhere. So perhaps:

After unstacking yellow, putdown yellow. Then, pickup green_block1 from white_block2 (since it's on the table, but wait, green is on white_block2. To pickup green_block1, you have to unstack it from white_block2. Because green is on top of white_block2. So to pick up green, you need to unstack green_block1 white_block2. Then put it down or stack it elsewhere. But where?

Alternatively, maybe stack it on orange_block1, which is on the table. But that would require stacking green on orange1. So unstack green from white2, stack on orange1. Then white_block2 is clear. So that would satisfy the first constraint's consequent.

But also, the second constraint requires that when green is not on yellow (which is always true), we need to have orange1 on white2. So we need to stack orange1 on white2. So in the plan, we need to stack orange_block_1 on white_block2.

Additionally, the third constraint requires that red_block1 has a block on top. So we need to put some block on red_block1. Which block? Maybe use one of the blocks that's already on the table. For example, orange_block2 or red_block1 is already on the table. Wait, red_block1 is on the table, clear. So we can stack another block on it. Let's say we stack orange_block2 on red_block1.

So putting all this together, the steps might be:

1. Unstack yellow_block1 from white_block1. Now holding yellow.
2. Putdown yellow_block1. Now yellow is on table. Main goal achieved.
But now we need to handle the constraints.

Wait, but after step 1, the first constraint's antecedent is true (yellow not on white1). Then we need to ensure that in that state or after, white_block2 is clear or on green. Since after step1, white_block2 still has green on it. So we need to make white_block2 clear. So step 3: unstack green_block1 from white_block2. Then putdown green_block1. Then white_block2 is clear. But that would satisfy the consequent.

But also, the second constraint requires that if green is not on yellow (which is always true), then orange1 must be on white2. So we need to stack orange1 on white2. So after clearing white2, stack orange1 on white2.

Then, the third constraint requires putting a block on red_block1. Let's stack orange2 on red1.

So the plan steps:

1. unstack yellow_block1 white_block1 → holding yellow.
2. putdown yellow_block1 → yellow on table. Goal achieved.
3. unstack green_block1 white_block2 → holding green.
4. putdown green_block1 → green on table. Now white_block2 is clear. So the first constraint's consequent is met.
5. Then, stack orange_block1 on white_block2. To do this: pickup orange_block1 (since it's on table and clear), then stack it on white_block2 (which is clear now). So:
5. pickup orange_block1
6. stack orange_block1 white_block2 → now orange1 is on white2. Satisfies the second constraint's consequent.
7. Now, handle the third constraint: put a block on red_block1. Let's use orange_block2. So:
7. pickup orange_block2
8. stack orange_block2 red_block1 → now red1 is not clear. Satisfies third constraint.

So the plan is:

unstack yellow_block1 white_block1
putdown yellow_block1
unstack green_block1 white_block2
putdown green_block1
pickup orange_block1
stack orange_block1 white_block2
pickup orange_block2
stack orange_block2 red_block1

Wait, but let's check the preconditions for each step.

Step1: unstack yellow from white1. Preconditions: yellow is on white1, yellow is clear (yes), not holding anything. Correct.

Step2: putdown yellow. Now holding yellow, so putdown is allowed. After putdown, yellow is on table.

Step3: unstack green from white2. Green is on white2, and green is clear (initially yes). So unstacking is allowed. Now holding green.

Step4: putdown green. Correct.

Step5: pickup orange1. It's on table, clear. Yes. Now holding orange1.

Step6: stack orange1 on white2. Need to check white2 is clear. After step4, white2 is clear (since green was moved). So stack is allowed. After stacking, orange1 is on white2, and white2 is not clear.

Step7: pickup orange2. It's on table and clear. Correct.

Step8: stack orange2 on red1. Red1 is clear. So stack allowed. Now red1 has orange2 on top.

This plan seems to satisfy all the constraints. Let's check each constraint:

1. The first constraint requires that "yellow not on white1" in at least one state. After step1, that's true. Then, the implication is that in that state or after, white2 is clear or white2 is on green. After step3 and 4, white2 is clear. So satisfied.

2. The second constraint: "green not on yellow" holds in all states. So we need to have orange1 on white2 at some point. Step6 does that.

3. Third constraint: red1 not clear. Step8 makes that true.

Yes, this plan should work. But is it optimal? Let's see if there's a shorter plan. For example, maybe combining some steps. But given the constraints, maybe not. The steps needed to satisfy the constraints are necessary. Let's count the steps: 8 actions. Is there a way to do it in fewer steps?

Wait, after step2, the main goal is achieved. The rest are for constraints. Let's see:

Alternatively, after step2 (putting yellow down), can we handle the constraints more efficiently?

For the first constraint's consequent: after unstacking yellow (step1), in the state after step1, we need white2 to be clear or on green. At that point, white2 still has green on it. So we need to make white2 clear. So steps3 and 4 are needed.

For the second constraint: since green is never on yellow, but the implication is triggered by the initial state. Therefore, we need to ensure orange1 is on white2 at some point. So step5 and 6 are needed.

For the third constraint: step7 and 8 are needed.

Alternatively, can we stack orange1 on white2 without putting green on the table? For example, after moving green, maybe stack green somewhere else instead of putting it down. But stacking would require another block. But maybe stack green on orange1, but then orange1 needs to be clear. Hmm, but then we could:

After step3 (unstack green from white2), instead of putting it down, stack green on orange1. Then orange1 is not clear anymore, but that might interfere with stacking orange1 on white2 later. Let's see:

Alternative steps:

1. unstack yellow white1
2. putdown yellow
3. unstack green white2
4. stack green orange1 → now orange1 has green on top. So orange1 is not clear. Then to stack orange1 on white2, we need to unstack green from orange1 first. Which adds more steps. So that would be longer. So not better.

Alternatively, maybe stack green on red1. Then step3: unstack green white2, stack green red1. Then red1 is not clear. So satisfies the third constraint. Then step5: stack orange1 on white2. So:

1. unstack yellow white1
2. putdown yellow
3. unstack green white2
4. stack green red1 → now red1 has green on top. Satisfies third constraint.
5. pickup orange1
6. stack orange1 white2 → since white2 is clear (after step3, green was moved). So this would work. Then, steps would be 6 actions. Wait, let's count:

1. unstack yellow white1
2. putdown
3. unstack green white2
4. stack green red1
5. pickup orange1
6. stack orange1 white2

That's 6 steps. But what about the third constraint? Step4 makes red1 not clear. So that's covered. The second constraint: step6 makes orange1 on white2. The first constraint: after step1, yellow is not on white1. Then, in step3, we unstack green from white2, which makes white2 clear. So in step3, after unstacking green, white2 is clear. So the first constraint's consequent is met in step3. So this plan might work with 6 steps. Is that correct?

Let me check:

After step1: yellow not on white1. Then, the first constraint's consequent must be met in some state after. After step3, white2 is clear. So yes. So this plan would satisfy all constraints with fewer steps.

So the steps would be:

1. unstack yellow_block1 white_block1
2. putdown yellow_block1
3. unstack green_block1 white_block2
4. stack green_block1 red_block1
5. pickup orange_block1
6. stack orange_block1 white_block2

But wait, step5: pickup orange_block1. After step4, the robotic arm is holding green_block1 after step3 (unstack green), then step4 is stack green on red1. After stack, the arm is empty. Then, step5: pickup orange1, which is on table and clear (since orange1 was initially clear). Yes.

So this plan has 6 steps. But does this satisfy all constraints?

First constraint: after step1, yellow not on white1. Then, after step3, white2 is clear. So the consequent is met.

Second constraint: since in the initial state, green is not on yellow, we need orange1 on white2 at some point. Step6 achieves that.

Third constraint: step4 stacks green on red1, making red1 not clear. So satisfied.

Yes, this plan is shorter. So this would be better. So the optimal plan would be 6 steps instead of 8. So I should think of that.

But wait, in the initial plan, stacking green on red1 would require that red1 is clear. Which it is. So step4: stack green red1. Yes, green is being held, red1 is clear. So yes.

So the steps would be:

unstack yellow_block1 white_block1
putdown yellow_block1
unstack green_block1 white_block2
stack green_block1 red_block1
pickup orange_block1
stack orange_block1 white_block2

Let me verify each action's preconditions:

1. unstack yellow from white1: yes, yellow is on white1, clear, arm empty.

2. putdown yellow: holding yellow.

3. unstack green from white2: green is on white2, clear, arm empty (after putdown).

4. stack green on red1: holding green, red1 is clear. Yes.

5. pickup orange1: orange1 is on table, clear, arm empty.

6. stack orange1 on white2: holding orange1, white2 is clear (since green was moved to red1). So yes.

Yes, this works. And this plan is shorter. So this is the optimal plan.

Now, check if all constraints are satisfied:

- "yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1" is true after step1. So first constraint satisfied.

- The implication for the first constraint: after step1, in the next state (step2), white2 is not clear. But after step3, white2 becomes clear. So in step3, the consequent is met (white2 is clear). So satisfies.

- "green_block_1 is not on yellow_block_1" is always true, but the constraint requires it to be true in at least one state (which it is). Then, the implication is that orange1 must be on white2. Which step6 does.

- The third constraint requires red_block1 to have a block on top. Step4 does that.

Yes, this plan meets all constraints with minimal steps.
