Okay, let's break this down. We need to get yellow_block_1 on the table. Currently, it's on white_block_1. We also have several constraints to satisfy along the way.

Here's the plan:

1.  Unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1. This satisfies the constraint that "yellow_block_1 is not on top of white_block_1".
2.  Putdown yellow_block_1. This achieves the goal of having yellow_block_1 on the table.
3.  Pickup green_block_1.
4.  Stack green_block_1 red_block_1. This satisfies the constraint that "there is a block on top of red_block_1, i.e., red_block_1 is not clear".
5.  Unstack green_block_1 red_block_1. This satisfies the constraint that "green_block_1 is not on top of yellow_block_1".
6.  Stack orange_block_1 white_block_2. This satisfies the constraint that "orange_block_1 is on top of white_block_2".

```
```
unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1
putdown yellow_block_1
pickup green_block_1
stack green_block_1 red_block_1
unstack green_block_1 red_block_1
stack orange_block_1 white_block_2
```
