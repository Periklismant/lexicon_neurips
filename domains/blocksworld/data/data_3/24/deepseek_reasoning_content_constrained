Okay, let's tackle this Blocksworld planning problem. The goal is to make sure brown_block_1 is clear. The initial state has a tower of blocks: purple_block_1 with green_block_1 on it, then blue_block_1, brown_block_1, white_block_1, and yellow_block_1 on top. Purple_block_2 is alone on the table. 

First, I need to remove whatever is on top of brown_block_1. Looking at the initial setup, brown_block_1 has white_block_1 on it, which in turn has yellow_block_1. So to clear brown_block_1, I need to remove white_block_1. But white_block_1 is under yellow_block_1. So I must first unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1, then unstack white_block_1 from brown_block_1.

Wait, but the constraints say that in some state, I must be holding white_block_1. Also, whenever I'm holding white_block_1, there must have been a previous state where I held purple_block_2. Plus, I must hold purple_block_1 at some point, and yellow_block_1 can never be on the table. So yellow_block_1 must always be on top of another block, never on the table.

Let's outline the steps. The main goal is to clear brown_block_1. So steps needed:

1. Unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1. Then put it down? Wait, but putting it down would place it on the table, which violates the constraint that yellow_block_1 must never be on the table. So instead, after unstacking yellow_block_1, I need to stack it somewhere else. But where? The only other block on the table is purple_block_2. So maybe stack yellow_block_1 onto purple_block_2. That way, yellow is not on the table.

But before that, I need to make sure purple_block_2 is clear. Initially, purple_block_2 is clear. So yes, I can stack yellow_block_1 onto it. So steps:

- unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1. Then stack yellow_block_1 purple_block_2.

Then, unstack white_block_1 from brown_block_1. But to do that, I need to have the arm free. So after stacking yellow, I can unstack white. But to unstack white, I need to be holding nothing. So after stacking yellow, the arm is free. Then unstack white_block_1 from brown_block_1. Then putdown white_block_1? But then white_block_1 would be on the table. But the constraints require that when holding white_block_1, there was a prior state holding purple_block_2. Let's check:

When I unstack white_block_1, I'm holding it. So the constraint is that before this, I must have held purple_block_2. Let's see: when did I hold purple_block_2? If I first pickup purple_block_2, then put it down again, but why? Wait, the constraint says that if I'm holding white_block_1 in any state, there must be an earlier state where I held purple_block_2. So maybe before handling white_block_1, I need to pick up purple_block_2 and then put it back. But how does that fit into the plan? Alternatively, when stacking yellow_block_1 onto purple_block_2, that action requires holding yellow_block_1. But maybe I need to handle purple_block_2 before that. Wait, stacking yellow on purple_block_2 requires that I'm holding yellow, which I get from unstacking it. So maybe the sequence is:

1. Unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1. Now holding yellow_block_1.
2. Stack yellow_block_1 onto purple_block_2. Now purple_block_2 has yellow on top, and I'm free.

But then to unstack white_block_1 from brown_block_1, I need to have the arm free, which I do. Then:

3. Unstack white_block_1 from brown_block_1. Now holding white_block_1. But according to the constraint, before this, I must have held purple_block_2. But when did I hold purple_block_2? So far, I haven't. So this would violate the constraint. Therefore, I need to pick up purple_block_2 at some point before holding white_block_1.

But how? Let's see. Maybe before step 3, I need to pick up purple_block_2 and put it down again. Let's insert steps:

After step 2 (stacking yellow on purple2), the arm is free. Then:

3. Pickup purple_block_2. Since it's on the table and clear (after stacking yellow on it, purple2 is not clear anymore. Wait, no. Wait, stacking yellow_block_1 on purple_block_2 would make purple_block_2 have yellow on top. So purple2 is not clear anymore. So I can't pick up purple2 after that. So that approach won't work.

Hmm. So maybe I need to pick up purple_block_2 before stacking yellow on it. Let's reorder:

1. Unstack yellow from white. Now holding yellow.

But to stack yellow on purple2, I need purple2 to be clear. Initially, it is. So perhaps:

1. Unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1. Now holding yellow.

But then stack yellow on purple2. Then, to handle the constraint that when holding white_block_1, I must have held purple2 before. But when I unstack white, I need to have previously held purple2. So perhaps before unstacking white, I need to have picked up purple2. But how? Let's see:

Wait, maybe the plan is:

- Unstack yellow from white. (Now holding yellow)
- Stack yellow on purple2. (Now purple2 has yellow, so it's not clear. So I can't pick up purple2 anymore.)
- Now, to unstack white, but need to have held purple2 before. So perhaps before stacking yellow on purple2, I need to pick up purple2 and put it down again. But that would require that purple2 is clear, which it is initially. So steps:

1. Pickup purple_block_2. (Possible since it's on table and clear.)
2. Putdown purple_block_2. (Now purple2 is clear again.)
3. Then unstack yellow from white. Now holding yellow.
4. Stack yellow on purple2. Now purple2 has yellow, so not clear.
5. Now, unstack white from brown. When unstacking white, I'm holding it. The constraint says that before this state, there must have been a state where I held purple2. Which happened in step 1. So that's satisfied.

But also, the constraints require that at least one state where I'm holding purple_block_1. So I need to handle that. So maybe after unstacking white, I need to pick up purple_block_1. Let's see.

Wait, the initial state has purple_block_1 under green_block_1. So to pick up purple_block_1, I need to clear it. So first, I need to remove green_block_1 and the blocks above it. Let's see:

The initial stack is purple1 -> green1 -> blue1 -> brown1 -> white1 -> yellow1. So to get to purple1, I need to unstack all the blocks above it. But that's a lot. The goal is to clear brown1. So maybe after clearing brown1 by removing white and yellow, but also need to hold purple1 at some point. So perhaps after dealing with white and yellow, I need to start dismantling the tower to get to purple1.

Wait, the goal is only to clear brown1, which is achieved by removing white and yellow. But the constraints also require that in some state, I'm holding purple1. So perhaps after dealing with the main goal, I need to do some steps to pick up purple1. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the steps to clear brown1 also require moving some blocks, which could involve holding purple1. Let's think.

So the initial tower is:

purple1 (on table)

green1 on purple1

blue1 on green1

brown1 on blue1

white1 on brown1

yellow1 on white1

So to clear brown1, need to remove white1 and yellow1. But yellow is on white, so first unstack yellow, then unstack white.

But to unstack yellow from white1, I need to have the arm free. Then, after unstacking yellow, I need to place it somewhere. Since yellow can't be on the table, stack it on purple2. Then unstack white1 from brown1 and put it somewhere. But where? Maybe on the table. But then white is on the table, but the constraint allows that. However, the constraint only prohibits yellow from being on the table. So putting white on the table is okay.

But let's outline the steps again, considering all constraints.

Main steps:

1. Unstack yellow from white (now holding yellow)
2. Stack yellow on purple2 (now purple2 has yellow, arm is free)
3. Unstack white from brown (now holding white). Here, the constraint requires that before this, I held purple2. But when did I hold purple2? In the current steps, only step 1 and 2. I held yellow in step 1, then stacked it. So no. Therefore, before step 3, I need to have held purple2. So perhaps before step 3, I need to do:

But after step 2, purple2 has yellow on it. So I can't pick up purple2 anymore. Therefore, I need to hold purple2 before stacking yellow on it. So steps:

1. Unstack yellow from white (hold yellow)
2. Putdown yellow on table (but constraint says yellow can't be on table. So invalid)
So can't do that. Therefore, need to stack yellow on purple2 without putting it down. So after step 1, stack yellow on purple2. Then, to satisfy the constraint that when holding white, I had previously held purple2. But when did I hold purple2? I didn't. So this is a problem.

Therefore, I need to pick up purple2 before handling white. How?

Alternative approach:

- First, pick up purple2 (since it's on the table and clear)
- Then putdown purple2 (so that I can stack something on it later)
- Then proceed to unstack yellow and stack it on purple2. But why put down purple2? Wait, if I just pick up purple2 and put it back, then in the state where I hold purple2, that satisfies the constraint that when I hold white, I had previously held purple2. So:

1. Pickup purple_block_2 (now holding it)
2. Putdown purple_block_2 (now it's back on table, clear)
3. Now, proceed to unstack yellow from white (hold yellow)
4. Stack yellow on purple2 (now purple2 has yellow)
5. Unstack white from brown (now holding white). At this point, the constraint is satisfied because step 1 held purple2 before step5.

Then, after unstacking white, put it down on the table. Then brown_block_1 is clear. But wait, after unstacking white from brown, brown is clear. But the goal is to have brown_block_1 clear, so that's achieved. But also, we need to have held purple1 at some point. So in the current steps, we haven't done that yet. So we need to add steps to hold purple1.

How can we hold purple1? It's under green1. So to pick up purple1, we need to remove all blocks above it. So green1 is on purple1, then blue1, brown1. So to clear purple1, need to remove green1, which requires removing blue1, which requires removing brown1, etc. But the goal is to clear brown1. Wait, if the goal is to have brown1 clear, but in the initial state, brown1 is under white and yellow. After steps 1-5, brown1 is clear. So the main goal is achieved. But we need to also satisfy the constraint of holding purple1. So perhaps after the main goal is achieved, we need to do additional steps to pick up purple1. But how?

Since purple1 has green1 on it. So to pick up purple1, we need to unstack green1 first, which requires unstacking blue1, which requires unstacking brown1 (which is now clear). Wait, after step5, brown1 is clear. So brown1 is on top of blue1. So to unstack brown1 from blue1, we can do that since brown1 is clear. Then, after unstacking brown1, put it down. Then unstack blue1 from green1, put it down. Then unstack green1 from purple1, then pick up purple1. But that's a lot of steps. But since the plan needs to be optimal, maybe there's a shorter way.

Alternatively, after achieving the main goal, maybe we can pick up purple1. Let's see:

After step5 (unstack white from brown), brown is clear. Now, brown is on blue1. To pick up purple1, which is under green1, which is under blue1, etc. Wait, the initial stack is purple1 -> green1 -> blue1 -> brown1 -> white1 -> yellow1. After step5, white and yellow are moved. So brown1 is on blue1, which is on green1, which is on purple1. So to get to purple1, we need to unstack green1, but green1 is under blue1, which is under brown1. So:

To unstack green1, need to first remove blue1. To remove blue1, need to remove brown1. But brown1 is clear now. So:

6. Unstack brown1 from blue1. Now holding brown1.
7. Putdown brown1 on table.
8. Unstack blue1 from green1. Now holding blue1.
9. Putdown blue1 on table.
10. Unstack green1 from purple1. Now holding green1.
11. Putdown green1 on table.
12. Pickup purple1. Now holding purple1.

Then, put it down again. But that's a lot of steps. But the problem requires an optimal plan, which is as short as possible. However, the constraints say that the plan must include holding white_block_1 (step5 does that), holding purple_block_2 (step1 does that), and holding purple_block_1 (step12). But the main goal is achieved at step5. But the constraints require that all four constraints are met. So the steps after step5 are necessary to meet the holding purple1 constraint. But this would make the plan very long. Is there a shorter way?

Wait, maybe after step5 (holding white), instead of putting it down, can we use it to help in unstacking the lower blocks? For example, after step5, we have white in hand. Then we can put it down, then proceed to unstack brown1 from blue1. But that's adding steps. Alternatively, maybe after step5, we can stack white on some block to free the hand. But the goal is already achieved, but we need to hold purple1.

Alternatively, after step5, putdown white (step6), then unstack brown1 from blue1 (step7), then putdown brown1 (step8), then unstack blue1 from green1 (step9), putdown blue1 (step10), unstack green1 from purple1 (step11), putdown green1 (step12), then pickup purple1 (step13). Then putdown purple1 (step14). But that's 14 steps, which seems long. But maybe there's a shorter path.

Wait, perhaps after step5 (holding white), instead of putting it down, can we stack it somewhere else? Like on purple2, but purple2 has yellow. So to stack white on yellow, we need to be holding white and yellow is clear. But yellow is on purple2, so it's clear (since in step4, we stacked yellow on purple2, so yellow is clear. Wait, stacking yellow on purple2 makes yellow the top block. So yellow is clear. So yes, we can stack white on yellow. So:

5. Stack white_block_1 on yellow_block_1. Now white is on yellow, which is on purple2. The arm is free. Now, the brown_block_1 is clear (goal achieved). Also, the constraint that yellow is never on the table is satisfied. Now, to hold purple1, we need to unstack all blocks above it. So:

6. Unstack brown1 from blue1. Now holding brown1.
7. Putdown brown1.
8. Unstack blue1 from green1. Hold blue1.
9. Putdown blue1.
10. Unstack green1 from purple1. Hold green1.
11. Putdown green1.
12. Pickup purple1. Now holding purple1. Then putdown.

But again, that's many steps. But the constraints require that we hold purple1 in some state, so step12 is necessary. But is there a way to do this with fewer steps?

Alternatively, after achieving the main goal (brown1 clear), perhaps we can directly unstack the lower blocks. Let me think:

After step5, if we putdown white (step6), then unstack brown1 (step7), but brown1 is already clear. So step7 is possible. Then, after unstacking brown1, we can put it down (step8). Then unstack blue1 from green1 (step9), putdown (step10), unstack green1 (step11), putdown (step12), pickup purple1 (step13). That's 13 steps. But maybe there's a shorter path.

Wait, the problem requires an optimal plan, so we need the minimal number of steps. Let's see if there's a way to combine some steps. For example, after step5 (holding white), instead of putting it down, can we use it to stack somewhere else and then use that to help unstacking? Or perhaps there's a way to hold purple1 without having to unstack everything.

Alternatively, maybe after the main steps to clear brown1, we can use the fact that purple1 is under green1. But to pick up purple1, we need to clear it. So we need to unstack green1, which requires unstacking blue1, which requires unstacking brown1. So even if brown1 is clear, we still need to unstack brown1 to get to blue1.

Wait, after step5, brown1 is on blue1 and is clear. So step5 is unstack white from brown, now holding white. Then, step6: putdown white. Then step7: unstack brown1 from blue1. Now holding brown1. Step8: putdown brown1. Then step9: unstack blue1 from green1. Hold blue1. Step10: putdown blue1. Step11: unstack green1 from purple1. Hold green1. Step12: putdown green1. Step13: pickup purple1. Then step14: putdown purple1. That's 14 steps, but necessary to hold purple1. But maybe there's a shorter way.

Alternatively, after step5, instead of putting down white, stack it on purple2's stack. Since after step4, purple2 has yellow. So stack white on yellow. Then, after step5: stack white_block_1 yellow_block_1. Now, purple2's stack is yellow, white. Then, to get to purple1, we need to unstack the blocks above it. So unstack brown1 from blue1 (step6), putdown (step7), unstack blue1 from green1 (step8), putdown (step9), unstack green1 from purple1 (step10), putdown (step11), then pickup purple1 (step12). That's 12 steps. But this is getting complicated.

But regardless, the main steps to achieve the goal and satisfy the constraints are:

1. Pickup purple_block_2 (to satisfy the constraint that before holding white, we held purple2)
2. Putdown purple_block_2 (so that we can stack yellow on it later)
3. Unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1
4. Stack yellow_block_1 on purple_block_2
5. Unstack white_block_1 from brown_block_1 (now brown is clear, goal achieved)
6. (Now need to hold purple1)

But how to hold purple1 without too many steps. Let's see:

After step5, we have to hold white. To satisfy the constraint, we need to have held purple2 before. Step1 does that. Then, we can putdown white (step6). Then, we need to unstack the blocks above purple1. So:

7. Unstack brown_block_1 from blue_block_1
8. Putdown brown_block_1
9. Unstack blue_block_1 from green_block_1
10. Putdown blue_block_1
11. Unstack green_block_1 from purple_block_1
12. Putdown green_block_1
13. Pickup purple_block_1 (now holding it)
14. Putdown purple_block_1

But this is 14 steps, which seems long, but maybe necessary. However, the problem states to provide an optimal plan, so we need to check if there's a shorter way.

Wait, maybe we can optimize the steps by reordering. For example, after step5 (holding white), instead of putting it down, stack it on purple2's stack. Then proceed. But stacking white on yellow (which is on purple2) would require that yellow is clear. Since after step4, yellow is on purple2 and clear. So step5: stack white on yellow. Now, the stack is purple2 -> yellow -> white. Arm is free. Then, unstack brown1 from blue1 (step6), putdown (step7), unstack blue1 (step8), putdown (step9), unstack green1 (step10), putdown (step11), pickup purple1 (step12). That's 12 steps. But step5 is stack, so steps:

1. Pickup purple2 (step1)
2. Putdown purple2 (step2)
3. Unstack yellow from white (step3)
4. Stack yellow on purple2 (step4)
5. Unstack white from brown (step5)
6. Stack white on yellow (step6)
7. Unstack brown from blue (step7)
8. Putdown brown (step8)
9. Unstack blue from green (step9)
10. Putdown blue (step10)
11. Unstack green from purple1 (step11)
12. Putdown green (step12)
13. Pickup purple1 (step13)
14. Putdown purple1 (step14)

Still 14 steps. Hmm. Alternatively, after step5 (unstack white from brown), stack white on purple2's stack (yellow). Then, we can proceed to unstack brown, but that's still necessary. But maybe there's a way to avoid some steps.

Alternatively, perhaps after step5, instead of stacking white, put it down, then use the arm to unstack brown. But that requires putting white on the table, which is allowed. Then:

5. Putdown white_block_1 (step5)
6. Unstack brown_block_1 from blue_block_1 (step6)
7. Putdown brown_block_1 (step7)
8. Unstack blue_block_1 from green_block_1 (step8)
9. Putdown blue_block_1 (step9)
10. Unstack green_block_1 from purple_block_1 (step10)
11. Putdown green_block_1 (step11)
12. Pickup purple_block_1 (step12)
13. Putdown purple_block_1 (step13)

So total steps would be:

1. Pickup purple2
2. Putdown purple2
3. Unstack yellow from white
4. Stack yellow on purple2
5. Unstack white from brown
6. Putdown white
7. Unstack brown from blue
8. Putdown brown
9. Unstack blue from green
10. Putdown blue
11. Unstack green from purple1
12. Putdown green
13. Pickup purple1
14. Putdown purple1

That's 14 steps. But the plan must be optimal. Is there a shorter way?

Wait, perhaps after step5 (unstack white from brown), we can use the white block to help in unstacking other blocks. For example, stack white on purple2's stack, then use that to hold other blocks. But not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe we can combine some steps. For example, after unstacking brown from blue (step7), instead of putting it down, stack it on purple2's stack. But that would require holding brown and purple2's stack being clear. But purple2 has yellow and white. So the top is white, which is clear. So stacking brown on white. Then, we can do that. Let's see:

After step5: unstack white from brown (hold white)
6. Stack white on yellow (purple2's stack)
7. Unstack brown from blue (hold brown)
8. Stack brown on white (now purple2's stack is yellow -> white -> brown)
9. Unstack blue from green (hold blue)
10. Stack blue on brown (purple2's stack becomes yellow->white->brown->blue)
11. Unstack green from purple1 (hold green)
12. Stack green on blue (purple2's stack is now yellow->white->brown->blue->green)
13. Pickup purple1 (now clear)
14. Putdown purple1

This way, we're using the purple2 stack to build a tower, avoiding putting blocks on the table. This reduces the number of putdown steps. Let's count:

1. Pickup purple2
2. Putdown purple2
3. Unstack yellow from white
4. Stack yellow on purple2
5. Unstack white from brown
6. Stack white on yellow
7. Unstack brown from blue
8. Stack brown on white
9. Unstack blue from green
10. Stack blue on brown
11. Unstack green from purple1
12. Stack green on blue
13. Pickup purple1
14. Putdown purple1

That's 14 steps, same as before. But maybe this is more efficient. However, the problem requires the minimal number of steps, so perhaps this isn't shorter.

Wait, but maybe there's a way to avoid some steps. For example, after step5 (unstack white from brown), stacking white on purple2's stack (step6), then unstacking brown (step7), stacking on purple2's stack (step8), etc. But each stack requires a step. So it's the same number.

Alternatively, is there a way to hold purple1 without having to unstack all the blocks above it? Like, if purple1 is under green1, but maybe we can unstack green1 from purple1 if green1 is clear. But green1 is under blue1, which is under brown1. So green1 is not clear unless we remove blue1 and brown1. So no, we have to unstack them.

So, regardless of the approach, it seems that to hold purple1, we need to unstack all blocks above it, which takes several steps. But the problem requires an optimal plan. However, perhaps the user made a mistake in understanding the constraints. Let's recheck the constraints.

Constraints:

1. Must hold white_block_1 in at least one state. (Achieved in step5)
2. If holding white_block_1, must have held purple_block_2 earlier. (Achieved by step1)
3. Must hold purple_block_1 in at least one state. (Achieved in step13)
4. Yellow_block_1 is never on the table. (Achieved by stacking on purple2)

So the minimal steps to achieve the goal and satisfy all constraints are the steps to clear brown1 (steps1-5), plus steps to hold purple1 (steps6-13). But perhaps there's a way to hold purple1 without needing to unstack all the blocks. For example, if after clearing brown1, we can unstack green1 from purple1. But how?

Wait, in the initial state, purple1 has green1 on it. To unstack green1, it must be clear. But green1 is under blue1. So unless blue1 is removed, green1 can't be unstacked. So to unstack green1, we need to first unstack blue1, which requires unstacking brown1. But after step5, brown1 is clear. So step5: unstack white from brown (now brown is clear). Then step6: unstack brown from blue. Now, blue is clear. Step7: unstack blue from green. Now green is clear. Step8: unstack green from purple1. Now, can pick up purple1. So steps:

1. Pickup purple2 (step1)
2. Putdown purple2 (step2)
3. Unstack yellow from white (step3)
4. Stack yellow on purple2 (step4)
5. Unstack white from brown (step5)
6. Stack white on yellow (step6)
7. Unstack brown from blue (step7)
8. Unstack blue from green (step8)
9. Unstack green from purple1 (step9)
10. Pickup purple1 (step10)

That's 10 steps. Then putdown purple1 (step11). So total 11 steps. Let's check:

Step1: Pickup purple2. Now holding purple2.
Step2: Putdown purple2. Now it's clear.
Step3: Unstack yellow from white. Now holding yellow.
Step4: Stack yellow on purple2. Now purple2 has yellow. Arm is free.
Step5: Unstack white from brown. Now holding white. (Satisfies constraint1. Step1 held purple2 before, so constraint2 satisfied.)
Step6: Stack white on yellow. Arm free.
Step7: Unstack brown from blue. Now holding brown.
Step8: Putdown brown. Now brown is on table. (But no constraint against that.)
Step9: Unstack blue from green. Now holding blue.
Step10: Putdown blue.
Step11: Unstack green from purple1. Now holding green.
Step12: Putdown green.
Step13: Pickup purple1. Now holding purple1 (satisfies constraint3).
Step14: Putdown purple1.

But this is still 14 steps. Wait, but after step7 (unstack brown from blue), brown is clear. Then step8: unstack blue from green. But blue is under brown, which is now on the table. Wait, no. After step7, brown is unstacked from blue. So blue is now on green and clear. So step8: unstack blue from green. Yes. Then step9: putdown blue. Then unstack green from purple1. So steps:

1. Pickup purple2
2. Putdown purple2
3. Unstack yellow from white
4. Stack yellow on purple2
5. Unstack white from brown
6. Stack white on yellow
7. Unstack brown from blue
8. Unstack blue from green
9. Unstack green from purple1
10. Pickup purple1
11. Putdown purple1

Wait, step7: unstack brown from blue (holding brown)
Step8: putdown brown (step7.5)
Step8: unstack blue from green (now possible)
Wait, no. After step7, we're holding brown. Need to put it down first. So:

7. Unstack brown from blue (holding brown)
8. Putdown brown
9. Unstack blue from green (now possible)
10. Putdown blue
11. Unstack green from purple1
12. Putdown green
13. Pickup purple1
14. Putdown purple1

Still 14 steps. So regardless of how we arrange it, it seems we need to unstack each block above purple1, which takes multiple steps. Therefore, the minimal plan would require at least 14 steps. But perhaps I'm missing a smarter way.

Wait, but after step5, when we unstack white from brown, brown is clear. So the main goal is achieved. The additional steps are only to satisfy the constraint of holding purple1. But maybe there's a way to hold purple1 without unstacking all the blocks above. For example, if after clearing brown1, we can somehow unstack purple1 from green1. But purple1 is under green1. To unstack green1 from purple1, green1 must be clear. Which requires unstacking blue1 from green1, which requires unstacking brown1 from blue1. Which is what we have to do.

Alternatively, perhaps after step5, instead of unstacking brown1 from blue1, we can directly unstack green1 from purple1. But green1 has blue1 on top. So no.

Therefore, it seems unavoidable that we need to unstack brown1, blue1, and green1 to reach purple1. So the minimal plan would have to include those steps.

But given that the user expects an optimal plan, which is as short as possible, perhaps there's a way to combine some steps. For example, after step5 (holding white), stack it somewhere, then use the arm to unstack brown1, blue1, etc. But each unstack requires the arm to be free. So each unstack and putdown requires two steps (unstack and putdown). So for each block, two steps.

So steps after achieving the goal (steps1-5):

5. Unstack white from brown (now holding white)
6. Stack white on yellow (arm free)
7. Unstack brown from blue (hold brown)
8. Putdown brown
9. Unstack blue from green (hold blue)
10. Putdown blue
11. Unstack green from purple1 (hold green)
12. Putdown green
13. Pickup purple1
14. Putdown purple1

So that's 14 steps total.

But the initial steps (1-5) are necessary to achieve the goal and satisfy the constraints. Steps6-14 are to satisfy holding purple1. But is there a way to avoid some of these steps?

Wait, maybe after step5 (holding white), instead of stacking it on yellow, use it to stack on another block, then unstack. But I don't see how that would help. Alternatively, after step5, putdown white (step6), then pickup purple2 (step7), then putdown purple2 (step8), but that's redundant. 

Alternatively, during the process of unstacking the lower blocks, can we use the already moved blocks to stack again. For example, after unstacking brown, stack it on purple2's stack. But that would require holding brown and purple2's stack being clear. But purple2's stack after step4 has yellow and white. So the top is white. So stack brown on white. Then, when unstacking blue, stack on brown. Etc. But this doesn't reduce the number of steps; it just changes putdown to stack.

So steps:

5. Stack white on yellow (step5)
6. Unstack brown from blue (step6)
7. Stack brown on white (step7)
8. Unstack blue from green (step8)
9. Stack blue on brown (step9)
10. Unstack green from purple1 (step10)
11. Stack green on blue (step11)
12. Pickup purple1 (step12)
13. Putdown purple1 (step13)

This way, instead of putting down each block, we stack them on the purple2 tower. So steps:

1. Pickup purple2 (1)
2. Putdown purple2 (2)
3. Unstack yellow from white (3)
4. Stack yellow on purple2 (4)
5. Unstack white from brown (5)
6. Stack white on yellow (6)
7. Unstack brown from blue (7)
8. Stack brown on white (8)
9. Unstack blue from green (9)
10. Stack blue on brown (10)
11. Unstack green from purple1 (11)
12. Stack green on blue (12)
13. Pickup purple1 (13)
14. Putdown purple1 (14)

Still 14 steps. No shorter. But maybe this is considered optimal since each step is necessary.

But the user might expect a shorter plan. Let's think again.

Wait, the main goal is to make brown_block_1 clear. Once we unstack white and yellow from brown, brown is clear. So steps1-5 achieve the goal. The other constraints require holding purple2 (step1), holding white (step5), and holding purple1 (step13). Also, yellow never on table (achieved by stacking on purple2). So perhaps the steps after step5 are only to satisfy the constraint of holding purple1, but maybe there's a shorter way to hold purple1.

Wait, after step5, if we can somehow pick up purple1 without unstacking all blocks above it. For example, if purple1 is on the table and has green1 on top. To pick up purple1, it must be clear. So no, unless we unstack green1, which requires unstacking blue1, which requires unstacking brown1.

So, yes, no way around it. So the minimal plan must include these steps.

Therefore, the final plan would be:

```
1. pickup purple_block_2
2. putdown purple_block_2
3. unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1
4. stack yellow_block_1 purple_block_2
5. unstack white_block_1 brown_block_1
6. stack white_block_1 yellow_block_1
7. unstack brown_block_1 blue_block_1
8. stack brown_block_1 white_block_1
9. unstack blue_block_1 green_block_1
10. stack blue_block_1 brown_block_1
11. unstack green_block_1 purple_block_1
12. stack green_block_1 blue_block_1
13. pickup purple_block_1
14. putdown purple_block_1
```

But this is 14 steps. Let's check if each action's preconditions are met.

Step1: pickup purple2. Preconditions: clear (yes, on table and clear), arm empty (yes).

Step2: putdown purple2. Holding purple2 (yes).

Step3: unstack yellow from white. Pre: yellow is on white, clear, arm empty (yes after step2).

Step4: stack yellow on purple2. Holding yellow, purple2 is clear (after step2, purple2 was put down, then step3 unstacked yellow, so purple2 is clear again? Wait, after step2, purple2 is on table and clear. Step3: unstack yellow from white. Now holding yellow. Step4: stack yellow on purple2. Pre: holding yellow, purple2 is clear (yes). So correct.

Step5: unstack white from brown. Pre: white on brown, white is clear (after step3, white was under yellow, but step3 unstacked yellow, so white is clear. Yes. Arm is empty (after step4, stacked yellow, so arm is free). Correct.

Step6: stack white on yellow. Pre: holding white, yellow is clear (yes, after step4, yellow is on purple2 and clear). Correct.

Step7: unstack brown from blue. Pre: brown on blue, brown is clear (after step5, brown is clear). Arm empty (after step6, stacked white, arm free). Correct.

Step8: stack brown on white. Pre: holding brown, white is clear (white is under brown now? Wait, step6 stacked white on yellow. So white is on top of yellow, so white is clear. Yes. So stack brown on white. Correct.

Step9: unstack blue from green. Pre: blue on green, blue is clear (after step7, blue was under brown, which was unstacked, so blue is clear). Arm empty (after step8, stacked brown, arm free). Correct.

Step10: stack blue on brown. Pre: holding blue, brown is clear. After step8, brown is under blue. Wait, step8 stacked brown on white, so brown is part of the purple2 stack. After step9, unstacked blue from green. Now holding blue. brown is on white, which is on yellow, which is on purple2. So brown is clear (yes). So stack blue on brown. Correct.

Step11: unstack green from purple1. Pre: green on purple1, green is clear (after step9, unstacked blue from green, so green is clear). Arm empty (after step10, stacked blue, arm free). Correct.

Step12: stack green on blue. Pre: holding green, blue is clear (blue is on brown, which is on white, etc. After step10, blue is on brown. So blue is clear (yes). Correct.

Step13: pickup purple1. Pre: on table, clear (after step11, unstacked green from purple1, so purple1 is clear). Arm empty (after step12, stacked green). Correct.

Step14: putdown purple1. Pre: holding purple1. Correct.

This plan satisfies all the actions' preconditions and effects. It also meets all the constraints:

- Holding white_block_1 in step5.
- Before step5 (holding white), step1 held purple2.
- Holding purple1 in step13.
- Yellow_block_1 is never on the table (stacked on purple2).

But is there a shorter plan? Let's see.

After step5, if we putdown white instead of stacking, then steps:

5. unstack white from brown
6. putdown white
7. unstack brown from blue
8. putdown brown
9. unstack blue from green
10. putdown blue
11. unstack green from purple1
12. putdown green
13. pickup purple1
14. putdown purple1

This is also 14 steps. But in this version, steps6-14 are putdowns instead of stacks. The number of steps is the same. So neither version is shorter.

Therefore, the minimal plan is 14 steps. But the problem says to provide an optimal plan whose length is equal or less than any other valid plan. So this must be the minimal.
