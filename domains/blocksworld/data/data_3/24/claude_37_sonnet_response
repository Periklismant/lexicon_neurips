Let's analyze the problem at hand:

We have 7 blocks: purple_block_1, green_block_1, blue_block_1, purple_block_2, brown_block_1, white_block_1, and yellow_block_1.

Initial state:
- purple_block_1 is on the table
- green_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1
- blue_block_1 is on top of green_block_1
- purple_block_2 is on the table
- brown_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1
- white_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1
- yellow_block_1 is on top of white_block_1
- purple_block_2 is clear
- yellow_block_1 is clear
- no block is being held

So, we have two towers:
1. purple_block_1 -> green_block_1 -> blue_block_1 -> brown_block_1 -> white_block_1 -> yellow_block_1
2. purple_block_2

Goal state:
- brown_block_1 is clear

Constraints:
1. At some point, we need to hold white_block_1.
2. Before we hold white_block_1, we need to have held purple_block_2.
3. At some point, we need to hold purple_block_1.
4. yellow_block_1 should never be on the table.

Looking at the initial state, brown_block_1 has white_block_1 on top of it, so it's not clear. To clear brown_block_1, we need to remove white_block_1 (and consequently, yellow_block_1 which is on top of white_block_1). 

Since one of the constraints is to hold white_block_1 at some point, this aligns well with the goal.

Another constraint is that before holding white_block_1, we need to have held purple_block_2. So, our first step should involve picking up purple_block_2.

The last two constraints state that we need to hold purple_block_1 at some point, and yellow_block_1 should never be on the table.

Given these considerations, here's a approach:

1. First, pick up purple_block_2 (to satisfy constraint 2).
2. Then, place purple_block_2 somewhere safe (but not on top of yellow_block_1, because we need to pick up yellow_block_1 later).
3. Unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1.
4. Stack yellow_block_1 somewhere (not the table).
5. Unstack white_block_1 from brown_block_1 (this would satisfy both constraint 1 and our goal). But we'll need to place white_block_1 somewhere too!
6. Place white_block_1 somewhere (not the table).
7. At this point, brown_block_1 is clear, which is our goal.
8. We still need to pick up purple_block_1 to satisfy constraint 3. This would require moving all the blocks above it.

But there's a complication. If we need to pick up purple_block_1, then we need to get rid of all the blocks above it. However, if we put those blocks on the table, then we might violate the constraint that yellow_block_1 should never be on the table. 

So we need a careful approach.

Actually, let's first be more precise about the initial state. We have two towers:
1. purple_block_1 -> green_block_1 -> blue_block_1 -> brown_block_1 -> white_block_1 -> yellow_block_1
2. purple_block_2

Now let me try to formulate a plan:

1. Pick up purple_block_2 from the table.
2. Put purple_block_2 on the table.
3. Unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1.
4. Stack yellow_block_1 on purple_block_2. (This keeps yellow_block_1 off the table)
5. Unstack white_block_1 from brown_block_1. (Now white_block_1 is being held, brown_block_1 is clear, which is our goal, and we've satisfied constraint 1)
6. Stack white_block_1 on yellow_block_1.
7. Dismantle the first tower:
   - Unstack brown_block_1 from blue_block_1.
   - Stack brown_block_1 on white_block_1.
   - Unstack blue_block_1 from green_block_1.
   - Stack blue_block_1 on brown_block_1.
   - Unstack green_block_1 from purple_block_1.
   - Stack green_block_1 on blue_block_1.
8. Pickup purple_block_1 from the table. (This satisfies constraint 3)
9. Put purple_block_1 on the table.

But wait, I'm not sure goal is reached and maintained. Let's check: We need to ensure that brown_block_1 is clear at the end of the plan. After step 5, brown_block_1 is clear, but it seems we're stacking brown_block_1 with other blocks in the subsequent steps, which would negate the goal.

Let's reformulate:

1. Pick up purple_block_2 from the table.
2. Stack purple_block_2 on yellow_block_1. (This ensures purple_block_2 is picked up)
3. Unstack purple_block_2 from yellow_block_1.
4. Put purple_block_2 on the table.
5. Unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1. (This is the first step in clearing brown_block_1)
6. Stack yellow_block_1 on purple_block_2. (This ensures yellow_block_1 is not on the table)
7. Unstack white_block_1 from brown_block_1. (Now, brown_block_1 is clear, which is our goal, and we've held white_block_1, satisfying constraint 1)
8. Stack white_block_1 on yellow_block_1.
9. Now, to satisfy constraint 3, we'd need to dismantle the first tower further to access purple_block_1:
   - Unstack brown_block_1 from blue_block_1.
   - Stack brown_block_1 on white_block_1. (But this would violate our goal of having brown_block_1 clear)

So it seems we can't maintain both the goal (brown_block_1 is clear) and satisfy all constraints simultaneously.

Actually, I see the problem. We need to ensure that brown_block_1 is clear at the end of the plan. But we also want to pick up purple_block_1 at some point, which would require undoing the tower purple_block_1 -> green_block_1 -> blue_block_1 -> brown_block_1. But we can do all the required unstacking, pick up purple_block_1, and then rebuild the tower in a way that leaves brown_block_1 clear.

So I think the following could work:

1. Pick up purple_block_2 from the table.
2. Stack purple_block_2 on yellow_block_1. (We're holding purple_block_2)
3. Unstack purple_block_2 from yellow_block_1.
4. Put purple_block_2 on the table.
5. Unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1.
6. Stack yellow_block_1 on purple_block_2. (Yellow_block_1 is never on the table)
7. Unstack white_block_1 from brown_block_1. (We're holding white_block_1, satisfying constraint 1)
8. Stack white_block_1 on yellow_block_1.
9. Unstack brown_block_1 from blue_block_1.
10. Stack brown_block_1 on white_block_1.
11. Unstack blue_block_1 from green_block_1.
12. Stack blue_block_1 on brown_block_1.
13. Unstack green_block_1 from purple_block_1.
14. Stack green_block_1 on blue_block_1.
15. Pickup purple_block_1 from the table. (We're holding purple_block_1, satisfying constraint 3)
16. Putdown purple_block_1 on the table.
17. Unstack green_block_1 from blue_block_1.
18. Stack green_block_1 on purple_block_1.
19. Unstack blue_block_1 from brown_block_1. (Now brown_block_1 is clear, which is our goal)
20. Stack blue_block_1 on green_block_1.

But this doesn't seem right, because we're making brown_block_1 not clear in step 12, and then making it clear again later. This isn't an optimal plan.

Oh, I didn't realize my formulation was so unclear. Let me redescribe the initial state in a clearer way:

Tower 1: purple_block_1 (bottom) -> green_block_1 -> blue_block_1 -> brown_block_1 -> white_block_1 -> yellow_block_1 (top)
Tower 2: purple_block_2 (alone on the table)

Our goal is to have brown_block_1 clear (no blocks on top). So we need to remove white_block_1 and yellow_block_1 from Tower 1.

The constraints are:
1. We must hold white_block_1 at some point.
2. Before holding white_block_1, we must have held purple_block_2.
3. We must hold purple_block_1 at some point.
4. yellow_block_1 must never be on the table.

Actually, let's rethink this. If we're trying to minimize the number of moves, we should think about the end state that satisfies our goal (brown_block_1 is clear).

So, the minimum moves to clear brown_block_1 would be:

1. Unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1.
2. Find a place to place yellow_block_1 (not the table).
3. Unstack white_block_1 from brown_block_1. Now brown_block_1 is clear!

But we have two more constraints: we need to pick up purple_block_2 before white_block_1, and we need to pick up purple_block_1 at some point. So the minimum plan would be:

1. Pick up purple_block_2 (satisfying constraint for later picking up white_block_1).
2. Put purple_block_2 somewhere (we'll use the table for now).
3. Unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1.
4. Stack yellow_block_1 on purple_block_2 (this keeps yellow_block_1 off the table).
5. Unstack white_block_1 from brown_block_1. (Now we've held white_block_1, and brown_block_1 is clear!)
6. Stack white_block_1 on yellow_block_1.
7. Unstack brown_block_1 from blue_block_1.
8. Stack brown_block_1 on white_block_1.
9. Unstack blue_block_1 from green_block_1.
10. Stack blue_block_1 on brown_block_1. (But this would make brown_block_1 not clear, which is against our goal.)

Ok, let's try a different approach. The goal is to have brown_block_1 clear, but I'm confused on what the final state of the blocks should be. Should all the blocks remain on the table (without any stacking) or should we maintain the original stacking with the exception of having brown_block_1 clear?

Since the goal is specifically about brown_block_1 being clear and there's no other guidance on the final state of other blocks, let's focus on achieving this goal while satisfying the constraints.

In the initial state, brown_block_1 has white_block_1 and yellow_block_1 on top of it. So, to make brown_block_1 clear, these blocks must be removed.

However, we have constraints: yellow_block_1 can't be placed on the table, we need to pick up purple_block_2 at some point before picking up white_block_1, and we also need to pick up purple_block_1 at some point.

Given these, here's a plan:

1. Pick up purple_block_2 (satisfying constraint 2).
2. Put down purple_block_2 (making it available for stacking later).
3. Unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1.
4. Stack yellow_block_1 on purple_block_2 (ensuring yellow_block_1 is not on the table).
5. Unstack white_block_1 from brown_block_1 (now we've held white_block_1, which satisfies constraint 1, and brown_block_1 is clear, which is our goal).
6. Find a place to put white_block_1. Since yellow_block_1 is on purple_block_2, we can't stack white_block_1 on yellow_block_1. We can stack it on brown_block_1, but then brown_block_1 wouldn't be clear. So, let's stack it somewhere on the original tower.
7. Stack white_block_1 on green_block_1. (But we can't do this directly because blue_block_1 is on top of green_block_1.)

Actually let's not get ahead of ourselves. Let's be more systematic. From the beginning, let's see what are allowed, legal moves that achieve our goal.

Tower 1: purple_block_1 (bottom) -> green_block_1 -> blue_block_1 -> brown_block_1 -> white_block_1 -> yellow_block_1 (top)
Tower 2: purple_block_2 (alone on the table)

Clear blocks: purple_block_2, yellow_block_1

Goal: brown_block_1 is clear

Constraints:
1. We must hold white_block_1 at some point.
2. Before holding white_block_1, we must have held purple_block_2.
3. We must hold purple_block_1 at some point.
4. yellow_block_1 must never be on the table.

Let's start by satisfying constraint 2 and 4:

1. Pickup purple_block_2 from the table. (We're holding purple_block_2)
2. Putdown purple_block_2 on the table.

Now, let's clear brown_block_1. We can start by removing yellow_block_1 and then white_block_1:

3. Unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1. (Now we're holding yellow_block_1)
4. Stack yellow_block_1 on purple_block_2. (This satisfies constraint 4, yellow_block_1 is never on the table)
5. Unstack white_block_1 from brown_block_1. (Now we're holding white_block_1, and brown_block_1 is clear, which is our goal. Also, we've satisfied constraint 1 by holding white_block_1.)

Now, brown_block_1 is clear, and we've satisfied constraints 1, 2, and 4. But we still need to satisfy constraint 3, which is to hold purple_block_1 at some point.

6. Stack white_block_1 on yellow_block_1.

Now to clear away brown_block_1, blue_block_1, and green_block_1 to access purple_block_1:

7. Unstack brown_block_1 from blue_block_1. (Now we're holding brown_block_1)
8. Stack brown_block_1 on white_block_1. (brown_block_1 is still clear, as nothing is stacked on it, though it's now on top of white_block_1)
9. Unstack blue_block_1 from green_block_1. (Now we're holding blue_block_1)
10. Stack blue_block_1 on brown_block_1. (brown_block_1 is now no longer clear, so we won't have achieved our goal)
11. Unstack green_block_1 from purple_block_1. (Now we're holding green_block_1)
12. Stack green_block_1 on blue_block_1.
13. Pickup purple_block_1 from the table. (Now we're holding purple_block_1, which satisfies constraint 3)
14. Putdown purple_block_1 on the table.
15. Unstack green_block_1 from blue_block_1. (Now we're holding green_block_1)
16. Stack green_block_1 on purple_block_1.
17. Unstack blue_block_1 from brown_block_1. (Now we're holding blue_block_1, and brown_block_1 is clear again, satisfying our goal)
18. Stack blue_block_1 on green_block_1.

But wait, this isn't optimal, and the problem asks for an optimal plan.

So let me think of the goal more carefully. We need to end up with brown_block_1 being clear. We also have to make sure that at some point in the plan, we hold both white_block_1 and purple_block_1, and that we hold purple_block_2 before we hold white_block_1.

The most efficient way to make brown_block_1 clear is to remove the blocks on top of it (white_block_1 and yellow_block_1). This can be done in just 2 unstack operations.

But to do that, we need to:
1. First pick up purple_block_2 (to satisfy constraint 2).
2. Pick up white_block_1 (which will involve unstacking yellow_block_1 first) (to satisfy constraint 1).
3. Pick up purple_block_1 (which will involve a lot of unstacking) (to satisfy constraint 3).

The challenge is that once we've made brown_block_1 clear, we don't want to place any blocks on it (otherwise it won't be clear anymore), but we still need to satisfy constraint 3 by picking up purple_block_1. Also, we can't put yellow_block_1 on the table at any point during our plan.

So, considering all these constraints, let's try to craft a plan.

Wait, it's not exactly clear if the goal of "brown_block_1 is clear" is a final goal (that needs to be true at the end of the plan) or just a goal that needs to be achieved at some point during the execution of the plan.

If it's the former, then we need to ensure that by the end of our plan, brown_block_1 has no block on top of it.
If it's the latter, then we just need to ensure that at some point during our plan, brown_block_1 had no block on top of it.

Given the ambiguity, I'll assume it's a final goal. The goal has to be satisfied at the end of the plan.

Tower 1: purple_block_1 (bottom) -> green_block_1 -> blue_block_1 -> brown_block_1 -> white_block_1 -> yellow_block_1 (top)
Tower 2: purple_block_2 (alone on the table)

Clear blocks: purple_block_2, yellow_block_1

Goal: brown_block_1 is clear (at the end of the plan)

Constraints:
1. We must hold white_block_1 at some point.
2. Before holding white_block_1, we must have held purple_block_2.
3. We must hold purple_block_1 at some point.
4. yellow_block_1 must never be on the table.

So, an optimal plan without violating any of the constraints would be:

1. Pickup purple_block_2 from the table. (We're holding purple_block_2, fulfilling constraint 2)
2. Putdown purple_block_2 on the table. (We free our arm to hold other blocks)
3. Unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1. (We're holding yellow_block_1)
4. Stack yellow_block_1 on purple_block_2. (This ensures yellow_block_1 is never on the table, satisfying constraint 4)
5. Unstack white_block_1 from brown_block_1. (We're holding white_block_1, which satisfies constraint 1. Also, brown_block_1 is now clear, which is our goal.)

Now, we've satisfied constraints 1, 2, 4, and our goal. We still need to satisfy constraint a, which is to hold purple_block_1 at some point.

Argh, we keep going in circles. Let's not be confused. The goal is for brown_block_1 to be clear at the end of the plan. Let's develop a plan to ensure that.

Given the goal and constraints, let's re-approach this. We've verified that the optimal plan to make brown_block_1 clear would be:

1. Pickup purple_block_2 from the table. (We're holding purple_block_2)
2. Putdown purple_block_2 on the table. (Free up our arm)
3. Unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1. (We're holding yellow_block_1)
4. Stack yellow_block_1 on purple_block_2. (Ensuring yellow_block_1 is never on the table)
5. Unstack white_block_1 from brown_block_1. (We're holding white_block_1, and brown_block_1 is now clear)

Now, we've satisfied constraints 1, 2, 4, and our goal. But we still need to satisfy constraint 3, which is to hold purple_block_1 at some point. The challenges are:

1. We need to place white_block_1 somewhere (since we're holding it).
2. We need to access purple_block_1, which is at the bottom of a tower.
3. We need to ensure that brown_block_1 remains clear at the end.

Let's think of a strategy to access purple_block_1 without invalidating our goal of having brown_block_1 clear.

Actually, I think the following should work:

6. Stack white_block_1 on purple_block_2. (We stack it on top of yellow_block_1, ensuring brown_block_1 remains clear)

Now, we have two towers:
Tower 1: purple_block_1 (bottom) -> green_block_1 -> blue_block_1 -> brown_block_1 (top, clear)
Tower 2: purple_block_2 (bottom) -> yellow_block_1 -> white_block_1 (top)

7. Unstack blue_block_1 from green_block_1. (Freeing up green_block_1, and we're holding blue_block_1)
8. Stack blue_block_1 on white_block_1. (This means we're now stacking blue_block_1 on Tower 2)
9. Unstack green_block_1 from purple_block_1. (Freeing up purple_block_1, and we're holding green_block_1)
10. Stack green_block_1 on blue_block_1. (Again, stacking on Tower 2)
11. Pickup purple_block_1 from the table. (We're holding purple_block_1, satisfying constraint 3)
12. Putdown purple_block_1 on the table. (freeing up our arm, and purple_block_1 is now on the table, with no block on top)

Now, all blocks are accounted for:
- purple_block_1 is alone on the table.
- Tower 1: brown_block_1 (alone, clear)
- Tower 2: purple_block_2 -> yellow_block_1 -> white_block_1 -> blue_block_1 -> green_block_1

This plan satisfies all constraints:
- brown_block_1 is clear at the end.
- We held white_block_1 (step 5).
- We held purple_block_2 before holding white_block_1 (step 1, before step 5).
- We held purple_block_1 (step 11).
- yellow_block_1 was never on the table.
- brown_block_1 is still clear at the end.

Actually, I think there's a slight modification we can make. Since after we unstack white_block_1 from brown_block_1 we have brown_block_1 clear (our goal), we can avoid stacking brown_block_1 on top of any block later. This means, instead of unstacking blue_block_1 from brown_block_1 (as in the original sequence), we can unstack brown_block_1 from blue_block_1.

So the modified sequence would be:

1. Pickup purple_block_2 from the table. (We're holding purple_block_2)
2. Putdown purple_block_2 on the table. (Free up our arm)
3. Unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1. (We're holding yellow_block_1)
4. Stack yellow_block_1 on purple_block_2. (Ensuring yellow_block_1 is never on the table)
5. Unstack white_block_1 from brown_block_1. (We're holding white_block_1, and brown_block_1 is now clear)
6. Stack white_block_1 on yellow_block_1.
7. Unstack brown_block_1 from blue_block_1. (We're holding brown_block_1)
8. Putdown brown_block_1 on the table. (brown_block_1 is on the table and clear)
9. Unstack blue_block_1 from green_block_1. (We're holding blue_block_1)
10. Stack blue_block_1 on white_block_1.
11. Unstack green_block_1 from purple_block_1. (We're holding green_block_1)
12. Stack green_block_1 on blue_block_1.
13. Pickup purple_block_1 from the table. (We're holding purple_block_1, satisfying constraint 3)
14. Putdown purple_block_1 on the table.

At the end, we have:
- brown_block_1 is on the table, clear (goal fulfilled).
- purple_block_1 is on the table.
- Tower: purple_block_2 -> yellow_block_1 -> white_block_1 -> blue_block_1 -> green_block_1.

All constraints are satisfied.

Let me double-check this again, as I think the above is a good plan.

But wait. I think I've been overthinking this. Looking at the facts again:

The original state of the world is the following:
	"purple_block_1 is on the table"
	"green_block_1 is on top of purple_block_1"
	"blue_block_1 is on top of green_block_1"
	"purple_block_2 is on the table"
	"brown_block_1 is on top of blue_block_1"
	"white_block_1 is on top of brown_block_1"
	"yellow_block_1 is on top of white_block_1"
	"there is no block on top of purple_block_2, i.e., purple_block_2 is clear"
	"there is no block on top of yellow_block_1, i.e., yellow_block_1 is clear"
	"you are not holding any block"

So initially tower 1 is:
purple_block_1 (bottom) -> green_block_1 -> blue_block_1 -> brown_block_1 -> white_block_1 -> yellow_block_1 (top)

And tower 2 is:
purple_block_2 (alone)

Our goal is:
brown_block_1 is clear

The constraints are:
- At some point, we need to hold white_block_1.
- Before holding white_block_1, we need to have held purple_block_2.
- At some point, we need to hold purple_block_1.
- yellow_block_1 should never be on the table.

Given these insights, let me reconsider the optimal plan:

1. Pickup purple_block_2 from the table. (We're holding purple_block_2, satisfying the constraint that we hold purple_block_2 before white_block_1)
2. Putdown purple_block_2 on the table. (Freeing up our arm)
3. Unstack yellow_block_1 from white_block_1. (We're holding yellow_block_1)
4. Stack yellow_block_1 on purple_block_2. (This ensures yellow_block_1 is never on the table)
5. Unstack white_block_1 from brown_block_1. (We're holding white_block_1, which satisfies the constraint that we hold white_block_1, and brown_block_1 is now clear, which is our goal)
6. Stack white_block_1 on yellow_block_1.

Now, brown_block_1 is clear, which is our goal. But we still have the constraint to hold purple_block_1. To access purple_block_1, we need to move brown_block_1, blue_block_1, and green_block_1. The trick is to ensure that after all these movements, brown_block_1 remains clear.

7. Unstack brown_block_1 from blue_block_1. (We're holding brown_block_1)
8. Putdown brown_block_1 on the table. (brown_block_1 is on the table and clear)
9. Unstack blue_block_1 from green_block_1. (We're holding blue_block_1)
10. Stack blue_block_1 on white_block_1.
11. Unstack green_block_1 from purple_block_1. (We're holding green_block_1)
12. Stack green_block_1 on blue_block_1.
13. Pickup purple_block_1 from the table. (We're holding purple_block_1, satisfying the constraint)
14. Putdown purple_block_1 on the table.

At the end, we have brown_block_1 clear (on the table), which is our goal, and all constraints are satisfied.

Actually, this seems right. Let me convert to the "ActionName Argument1 ... ArgumentN" format:

1. pickup purple_block_2
2. putdown purple_block_2
3. unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1
4. stack yellow_block_1 purple_block_2
5. unstack white_block_1 brown_block_1
6. stack white_block_1 yellow_block_1
7. unstack brown_block_1 blue_block_1
8. putdown brown_block_1
9. unstack blue_block_1 green_block_1
10. stack blue_block_1 white_block_1
11. unstack green_block_1 purple_block_1
12. stack green_block_1 blue_block_1
13. pickup purple_block_1
14. putdown purple_block_1

But wait, one more thing. is this plan optimal? Let's think about it. The optimal plan needs to:
- Satisfy all constraints.
- Achieve the goal.
- Do so in the least number of steps.

Looking at the constraints, we need to hold:
1. purple_block_2
2. white_block_1 (after holding purple_block_2)
3. purple_block_1
4. And ensure yellow_block_1 is never on the table.

Our goal is to have brown_block_1 clear.

Given these, to achieve the goal of having brown_block_1 clear, we need to remove the blocks on top of it. In the initial state, there are two blocks on top of brown_block_1: white_block_1 and yellow_block_1. To remove these, we'd need to first unstack yellow_block_1 (since it's on top), and then unstack white_block_1. This takes 2 unstack operations.

Constraint 4 requires that yellow_block_1 is never on the table. So after unstacking yellow_block_1, we'd need to stack it on another block.

Constraint 1 and 2 require that we hold purple_block_2 at some point, and we hold it before holding white_block_1. The optimal way to fulfill these would be to pick up purple_block_2, put it down, then proceed to hold white_block_1 (which we'd do anyway to clear brown_block_1).

Constraint 3 requires that we hold purple_block_1, but purple_block_1 is at the bottom of a tower in the initial state. To access it, we'd need to move all the blocks above it (green_block_1, blue_block_1, brown_block_1, white_block_1, and yellow_block_1). This'd require a lot of operations.

So to optimize, one approach would be:
1. Satisfy Constraints 1, 2, and 4 while achieving our goal in the process (clear brown_block_1).
2. Then, work on satisfying Constraint 3 by accessing purple_block_1.

Let me revisit the plan with this in mind:

1. pickup purple_block_2 (Satisfying Constraint 1)
2. putdown purple_block_2 (Freeing up our arm)
3. unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1 (Necessary to clear brown_block_1)
4. stack yellow_block_1 purple_block_2 (Satisfying Constraint 4)
5. unstack white_block_1 brown_block_1 (Completing the clearing of brown_block_1, satisfying our goal, and also satisfying Constraint 2)
6. stack white_block_1 yellow_block_1 (Freeing up our arm, still maintaining our goal)

Now, we have our goal (brown_block_1 is clear) and have satisfied Constraints 1, 2, and 4. To satisfy Constraint 3, we need to hold purple_block_1, which is at the bottom of a tower. We need to move blocks to access it.

7. unstack brown_block_1 blue_block_1 (moving brown_block_1 to access blocks below it)
8. putdown brown_block_1 (ensuring it's clear, maintaining our goal)
9. unstack blue_block_1 green_block_1
10. stack blue_block_1 white_block_1
11. unstack green_block_1 purple_block_1
12. stack green_block_1 blue_block_1
13. pickup purple_block_1 (Satisfying Constraint 3)
14. putdown purple_block_1 (Freeing up our arm)

At the end, brown_block_1 is clear (it's on the table with no block on top), which achieves our goal. All our constraints are satisfied. And this uses 14 moves. Is this optimal? I think it is, given the constraints we have.

Let me revise the plan once more, making sure it's correct. We have two towers:
- Tower 1: purple_block_1 (bottom) -> green_block_1 -> blue_block_1 -> brown_block_1 -> white_block_1 -> yellow_block_1 (top)
- Tower 2: purple_block_2 (alone, on the table)

Goal: brown_block_1 is clear.

Constraints:
1. Hold white_block_1 at some point.
2. Hold purple_block_2 before holding white_block_1.
3. Hold purple_block_1 at some point.
4. yellow_block_1 should never be on the table.

Optimal Plan:
1. pickup purple_block_2
2. putdown purple_block_2
3. unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1
4. stack yellow_block_1 purple_block_2
5. unstack white_block_1 brown_block_1
6. stack white_block_1 yellow_block_1
7. unstack brown_block_1 blue_block_1
8. putdown brown_block_1
9. unstack blue_block_1 green_block_1
10. stack blue_block_1 white_block_1
11. unstack green_block_1 purple_block_1
12. stack green_block_1 blue_block_1
13. pickup purple_block_1
14. putdown purple_block_1

At the end, brown_block_1 is clear (on the table), which is our goal, and all constraints are satisfied. This is optimal because we've accomplished the goal and satisfied all constraints with a minimal number of operations.

Actually, I almost forgot a constraint check. Let me verify constraint 4: "yellow_block_1 should never be on the table". According to my plan, yellow_block_1 is only ever on top of white_block_1 (initial state) or on top of purple_block_2 (after step 4). I never put it on the table, so this constraint is also satisfied.

So my final, optimal plan is:

1. pickup purple_block_2
2. putdown purple_block_2
3. unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1
4. stack yellow_block_1 purple_block_2
5. unstack white_block_1 brown_block_1
6. stack white_block_1 yellow_block_1
7. unstack brown_block_1 blue_block_1
8. putdown brown_block_1
9. unstack blue_block_1 green_block_1
10. stack blue_block_1 white_block_1
11. unstack green_block_1 purple_block_1
12. stack green_block_1 blue_block_1
13. pickup purple_block_1
14. putdown purple_block_1
