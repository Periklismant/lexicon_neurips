Okay, let's break this down. We need to clear brown_block_1, which means removing white_block_1 and yellow_block_1. We also have several constraints: we must hold white_block_1 at some point, and before that, we must hold purple_block_2. We also must hold purple_block_1 at some point, and yellow_block_1 must never be on the table.

Here's the plan:

```
```
unstack yellow_block_1 white_block_1
putdown yellow_block_1
unstack white_block_1 brown_block_1
pickup purple_block_2
stack white_block_1 purple_block_2
pickup purple_block_1
putdown purple_block_1
```
