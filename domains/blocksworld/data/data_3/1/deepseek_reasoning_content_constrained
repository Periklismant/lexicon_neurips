Okay, let's tackle this Blocksworld planning problem. The goal is to get brown_block_1 onto the table, but there are several constraints to satisfy along the way. Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's look at the initial state. The blocks are arranged as follows:

- white_block_1 is on the table.
- white_block_2 is on top of white_block_1.
- green_block_1 is on white_block_2.
- brown_block_1 is on green_block_1. And brown_block_1 is clear.
- yellow_block_1 is on the table and clear.
- orange_block_1 is on the table with white_block_3 on top, which is clear.

The goal is to have brown_block_1 on the table. So, we need to move brown_block_1 from its current position (on green_block_1) to the table. To do that, since it's on top of green_block_1 and it's clear, we can unstack it directly. Wait, but the preconditions for unstack require that the robotic arm isn't holding anything. So the first action might be unstack brown_block_1 green_block_1. Then put it down with putdown brown_block_1. That would achieve the goal in two steps. But wait, there are constraints that must be satisfied. So the plan can't just be those two actions; we have to make sure all the constraints are met.

Let's list the constraints:

1. At least one state where green_block_1 is not on the table. So green_block_1 must be moved from its initial position (on white_block_2) to somewhere else, maybe stacked or on the table. But in the initial state, green_block_1 is on white_block_2, which is on white_block_1, so green_block_1 isn't on the table. Wait, in the initial state, green_block_1 is on white_block_2, so it's not on the table. So the first constraint is already satisfied in the initial state. Hmm, but maybe during the plan, it's moved onto the table and then back off? Wait, the constraint says "must hold in at least one state". If the initial state already has green_block_1 not on the table (since it's on white_block_2), then that's already satisfied. So maybe we don't need to do anything for constraint 1. But wait, let me check. The original state says green_block_1 is on top of white_block_2. So yes, green_block_1 is not on the table in the initial state. Therefore, constraint 1 is already met. So we don't need to do anything extra for that.

But constraint 2 says that if in some state green_block_1 is not on the table, then in that state or a subsequent state, white_block_1 must be clear. But in the initial state, green_block_1 is not on the table (on white_block_2), and white_block_1 has white_block_2 on it. So white_block_1 is not clear. So the condition for constraint 2 is that whenever green_block_1 is not on the table, white_block_1 must be clear in that state or later. But in the initial state, green_block_1 is not on the table, and white_block_1 is not clear. So we need to ensure that after the initial state, at some point when green_block_1 is not on the table, white_block_1 becomes clear. So perhaps we need to make white_block_1 clear at some point after the initial state. How? The initial stack is white_block_1 has white_block_2, which has green_block_1, which has brown_block_1. So to clear white_block_1, we need to remove white_block_2 from it. But white_block_2 is under green_block_1 and brown_block_1. So we need to unstack brown_block_1 first, then green_block_1, then white_block_2. But moving white_block_2 would clear white_block_1. So if we move white_block_2 at some point, then white_block_1 becomes clear. So if during the plan, after moving green_block_1 (which is not on the table), we have to make sure that white_block_1 is clear in that state or later. Let's see. Suppose we unstack brown_block_1 from green_block_1. Then, green_block_1 is still not on the table (it's on white_block_2). So constraint 2 requires that white_block_1 is clear either now or later. But white_block_1 is not clear yet. So maybe after unstacking brown_block_1, we need to unstack green_block_1 from white_block_2, then unstack white_block_2 from white_block_1. Then white_block_1 becomes clear. But this might be part of the plan. But the main goal is to put brown_block_1 on the table. Let's think.

Constraint 3: At least one state where brown_block_1 is not clear (i.e., something is on top of it). So after moving brown_block_1, maybe we stack something on it. But the goal is to have it on the table, so perhaps after putting it down, we pick up another block and stack it on brown_block_1. But that's extra steps, but the constraints require that this happens at least once. So we need to have a step where brown_block_1 has a block on top of it.

Constraint 4: If in some state brown_block_1 is not clear (has a block on top), then in an earlier state, yellow_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1. So to satisfy this, we need to have a state where yellow is on orange, before any state where brown is covered. But initially, orange_block_1 has white_block_3 on it, so yellow isn't on orange. So we have to stack yellow on orange at some point, then stack something on brown_block_1.

Constraint 5: At least one state where brown_block_1 is not on top of green_block_1. Well, the initial state has brown on green. The goal is to have brown on the table. So once we move brown from green to the table, that state satisfies this constraint. But maybe during the plan, we could also move brown somewhere else temporarily. But the goal requires it to be on the table in the end. So perhaps just moving brown to the table will satisfy constraint 5.

Constraint 6: If in some state brown_block_1 is not on top of green_block_1, then in an earlier state, the robot is holding yellow or white_block_1. So when we move brown off green (which is needed for the goal), we need to have previously held yellow or white_block_1. So for example, if we unstack brown from green (which is the first step to move it to table), then in the state after that, brown is not on green. So the condition applies. Therefore, before that action (unstack brown green), we must have a state where the robot is holding yellow or white_block_1. But how?

Wait, the unstack action requires that the robot is not holding anything. So to unstack brown from green, the robot must be empty. So before unstacking, the robot can't be holding yellow or white. So how to satisfy constraint 6? Because when we unstack brown from green, the next state has brown not on green, so the constraint says that in some earlier state, the robot held yellow or white_block_1. Therefore, the plan must include an action where the robot picks up yellow or white_block_1 before unstacking brown from green.

But wait, the initial state has yellow on the table and clear. So we could pick up yellow, then put it down again, which would create a state where the robot was holding yellow. That would satisfy the condition. Alternatively, maybe during the plan, we need to hold yellow or white_block_1 before moving brown.

So putting this all together, the plan needs to:

1. Move brown_block_1 to the table (goal).

But to do that, the robot must unstack brown from green, then put it down. But before unstacking brown, the robot needs to have held yellow or white_block_1 at some earlier step.

So possible steps:

- pickup yellow_block_1 (since it's on the table and clear). Then put it down again. This would create a state where the robot was holding yellow. Then proceed to unstack brown.

But also, constraint 3 requires that in some state, brown_block_1 is not clear. So after putting brown on the table, we need to stack something on it. For example, maybe stack yellow on brown. But then we have to unstack it again to meet the goal? Wait, no. The goal is just brown on the table. So if after putting brown on the table, we stack another block on it, then in the final state, brown would have a block on top, which violates the goal. So we need to stack something on brown and then remove it again. But that's extra steps. Alternatively, perhaps stack something on brown before moving it to the table. Wait, no. Because brown is initially on green. So to stack something on brown, we need to have another block, but brown is already clear. Let's think:

Wait, the initial state of brown_block_1 is on green_block_1 and is clear. So to stack a block on brown, we can pick up another block (like yellow) and stack it on brown. But then brown would have yellow on top. Then, to get brown to the table, we first need to unstack yellow from brown, put it down, then unstack brown from green. But that's more steps.

Alternatively, maybe during the process of moving brown, we can stack something on it temporarily. Let's outline possible steps.

But let's start considering all constraints step by step.

First, the main goal: brown_block_1 on table.

Constraints:

- Constraint 3: At least one state where brown_block_1 is not clear. So during the plan, we must have a state where there's a block on top of brown_block_1.

- Constraint 4: Any state where brown_block_1 is not clear must have a previous state where yellow is on orange.

So, to satisfy constraint 3 and 4:

We need to first stack yellow on orange, then stack some block on brown_block_1. Then later remove that block from brown to put it on the table.

So steps could be:

1. Unstack white_block_3 from orange_block_1 (since orange has white_block_3 on it). But white_block_3 is clear. So unstack white_block_3 from orange, put it down. Then stack yellow_block_1 on orange_block_1. Then stack that block on brown_block_1.

Wait, but yellow is on the table. So:

1. pickup yellow_block_1.

2. stack yellow_block_1 on orange_block_1. But orange_block_1 has white_block_3 on it, so we need to clear orange_block_1 first. Wait, in the initial state, orange_block_1 has white_block_3 on top. So to stack yellow on orange, we need to move white_block_3 first.

So steps:

1. unstack white_block_3 orange_block_1. Then putdown white_block_3.

Now, orange_block_1 is clear.

2. pickup yellow_block_1.

3. stack yellow_block_1 orange_block_1. Now, yellow is on orange. This satisfies the condition for constraint 4, because if later we stack something on brown, that requires that in an earlier state, yellow was on orange.

Then, to stack something on brown_block_1:

But brown_block_1 is on green_block_1. So to stack something on brown, we need to pick up a block (like white_block_3) and stack it on brown.

4. pickup white_block_3.

5. stack white_block_3 brown_block_1.

Now, brown_block_1 has white_block_3 on top, so it's not clear. This satisfies constraint 3.

Then, to move brown_block_1 to the table:

We need to unstack white_block_3 from brown_block_1 (since brown is under it). But wait, the stack is green_block_1 -> brown_block_1 -> white_block_3. So to unstack white_block_3 from brown, we can do that because white_block_3 is clear. Then put it down.

6. unstack white_block_3 brown_block_1.

7. putdown white_block_3.

Now, brown_block_1 is clear again. Now, we can unstack brown_block_1 from green_block_1.

8. unstack brown_block_1 green_block_1.

9. putdown brown_block_1.

This achieves the goal. But also, during this process, we have to satisfy constraint 6. Let's check:

Constraint 6 says that if brown is not on green (which is true after step 8), then in an earlier state, the robot was holding yellow or white_block_1.

Looking at the steps, step 2 is holding yellow (step 2: pickup yellow). Then step 4: holding white_block_3 (but white_block_3 is not white_block_1). So, in step 2, the robot held yellow_block_1, which satisfies the condition for constraint 6. So that's covered.

Now, let's check constraint 2. The initial state already satisfies that green_block_1 is not on the table. But after step 8, when we unstack brown_block_1, green_block_1 is still on white_block_2, so not on the table. So at that point, we need to ensure that white_block_1 is clear at that state or later. White_block_1 has white_block_2 on it, which is under green_block_1. So after unstacking brown and green, we need to clear white_block_1.

Wait, after step 8, the stack is white_block_1 -> white_block_2 -> green_block_1. So to make white_block_1 clear, we need to remove white_block_2. But green_block_1 is on white_block_2. So we need to unstack green_block_1 from white_block_2, then unstack white_block_2 from white_block_1.

But in the current plan, after step 8, brown is being put down, but green is still on white_block_2. So green_block_1 is not on the table (since it's on white_block_2), so in the state after step 8, green is not on the table, so according to constraint 2, white_block_1 must be clear in that state or later.

But in that state, white_block_1 still has white_block_2 on it. So we need to make sure that after step 8, there's a step where white_block_1 becomes clear.

So after step 9, we need to unstack green_block_1 from white_block_2, then unstack white_block_2 from white_block_1.

But those steps aren't part of the current plan. So the current plan doesn't satisfy constraint 2.

Therefore, we need to adjust the plan to include steps that clear white_block_1 after moving brown.

So let's adjust:

After step 9 (putdown brown_block_1), we need to handle the green_block_1 and white_block_2.

Let's see:

10. unstack green_block_1 white_block_2. But green is on white_block_2. Is it clear? Initially, green had brown on top, but after step 8, brown is moved. So green_block_1 is clear? No. Wait, after step 8, when we unstack brown_block_1 from green_block_1, the effect is that brown is no longer on green, and green becomes clear. So yes, after step 8, green_block_1 is clear. So step 10: unstack green_block_1 white_block_2. Wait, no: to unstack green from white_block_2, the preconditions are: green is on white_block_2, green is clear, and the arm is empty. After step 8, the arm is holding brown_block_1. After step 9, the arm is empty. So after step 9, we can do:

10. unstack green_block_1 white_block_2.

But wait, after step 8 (unstack brown_block_1 green_block_1), the arm is holding brown_block_1. Then step 9 is putdown brown_block_1, so the arm is empty. Then, green_block_1 is on white_block_2 and is clear (since brown was removed). So yes, we can unstack green_block_1 from white_block_2.

11. putdown green_block_1.

Now, green is on the table. Then, white_block_2 is on white_block_1 and is clear (since green was removed).

12. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1.

13. putdown white_block_2.

Now, white_block_1 is clear. So at step 13, white_block_1 is clear. Since after step 8, green_block_1 was not on the table (it was on white_block_2), and in step 13, white_block_1 becomes clear, which satisfies constraint 2: if green is not on the table (which is true from step 0 to step 10, and after step 10, green is on the table), then white_block_1 must be clear at that state or later. So steps 12-13 make white_block_1 clear.

But this adds several steps. But the plan must be optimal, i.e., as short as possible. So maybe there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, after moving brown to the table, perhaps we can leave green and white_block_2 as they are, but then constraint 2 isn't satisfied. Because after step 8, green is not on the table (still on white_block_2), so in that state, we need to have white_block_1 clear at some point after. So we need to make white_block_1 clear at least once after any state where green is not on the table. Wait, but the initial state has green not on the table, and white_block_1 not clear. So we need to make sure that after the initial state, there's a state where green is not on the table and white_block_1 is clear. Because the constraint says "if in some state s, green is not on the table, then in s or a subsequent state, white_block_1 is clear".

In the initial state, green is not on the table, and white_block_1 is not clear. So we need to have a state after the initial state where green is not on the table and white_block_1 is clear. So during the plan, even if green is moved to the table later, we need to have at least one state where green is not on the table (which could be the initial state) and white_block_1 is clear. But in the initial state, white_block_1 is not clear. So we need to have a subsequent state where green is not on the table and white_block_1 is clear.

So how? By moving white_block_2 off white_block_1. That makes white_block_1 clear. But white_block_2 is under green and brown. So after moving brown and green, we can unstack white_block_2 from white_block_1.

But that's what I added in steps 10-13. But that adds steps. Is there a way to avoid those steps and still satisfy the constraints?

Alternatively, maybe during the process of moving brown, we can also clear white_block_1.

Wait, if after moving brown and green, we move white_block_2 to the table, that clears white_block_1. But that requires moving green first. Let's think.

Original stack: white_block_1 has white_block_2, which has green_block_1, which has brown_block_1.

To move white_block_2 off white_block_1, we need to unstack white_block_2. But it's under green. So first, we need to move green and brown.

So steps could be:

1. unstack brown_block_1 green_block_1.

2. putdown brown_block_1. Now, brown is on table. But then green is still on white_block_2, which is on white_block_1. So to clear white_block_1, we need to unstack green and white_block_2.

But to satisfy constraint 2, after moving brown (so green is not on the table), we need to make white_block_1 clear. So steps:

3. unstack green_block_1 white_block_2.

4. putdown green_block_1.

5. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1.

6. putdown white_block_2.

Now, white_block_1 is clear.

But this adds steps 3-6. But in this case, after step 3, green is on the table. So after step 3, green is on the table, so the state where green is not on the table is from step 0 to step 3. So constraint 2 requires that in any state where green is not on the table, white_block_1 must be clear in that state or later. So in the initial state, green is not on the table, and white_block_1 is not clear. But after step 5, white_block_1 is clear. So all states after step 5 would satisfy that. But the initial state and steps 1-4 are before step 5. So the initial state (and steps 1-4) have green not on the table but white_block_1 not clear. So constraint 2 requires that in those states (like initial and steps 1-4), either they have white_block_1 clear (which they don't) or there's a subsequent state where white_block_1 is clear (which step 5 does). So the plan would satisfy constraint 2 as long as after those states, white_block_1 becomes clear. Which it does in step 5. So perhaps this is acceptable.

But this adds steps. However, the problem says the plan must be optimal (as short as possible). So maybe there's a way to combine some steps.

Wait, but let's think again about constraint 2. It's a conditional: if in any state s, green is not on the table, then in s or a later state, white_block_1 is clear. So for all s where green is not on the table, the implication holds. The initial state has s0: green not on table. In s0, white_block_1 is not clear. So there must exist a state after s0 where white_block_1 is clear. Similarly, if during the plan, green is moved back to not on the table (e.g., stacked again), then in those states, white_block_1 must be clear. But the plan may not need to move green back.

So to satisfy constraint 2, it's sufficient to ensure that after the initial state, there's a state where white_block_1 is clear. Because in all other states where green is not on the table (if any), white_block_1 must be clear in that state or later.

So perhaps the easiest way is to ensure that white_block_1 becomes clear at least once after the initial state. So steps to unstack white_block_2 from white_block_1 would do that. But as part of the plan.

But how to do that with minimal steps.

Alternatively, maybe after moving brown, we can move green and white_block_2, but that's adding steps. Let's see.

But let's go back to the original plan with the constraints.

Main goal: brown on table.

Constraints:

3. brown must have a block on top at some point.

4. Before that, yellow must be on orange.

5. At least one state where brown is not on green. (This is satisfied when brown is moved.)

6. When brown is not on green, earlier held yellow or white_block_1.

So the steps needed:

- To satisfy constraint 4, stack yellow on orange. But orange initially has white_block_3. So first move white_block_3, then stack yellow on orange.

- Then stack something on brown (to satisfy constraint 3).

- Then unstack that block from brown.

- Then unstack brown from green and put it down.

- Also, satisfy constraint 6 by holding yellow or white_block_1 before unstacking brown.

So let's outline this:

1. unstack white_block_3 orange_block_1.

2. putdown white_block_3.

3. pickup yellow_block_1.

4. stack yellow_block_1 orange_block_1. Now, yellow is on orange, satisfying the precondition for constraint 4.

5. unstack yellow_block_1 orange_block_1. (To get yellow back, but maybe not necessary.)

Alternatively, after step 4, pick up another block to stack on brown.

Wait, after step 4, yellow is on orange. To stack something on brown, we need a block. Let's use white_block_3, which was put down in step 2.

6. pickup white_block_3.

7. stack white_block_3 brown_block_1. Now, brown has white_block_3 on top, satisfying constraint 3.

8. unstack white_block_3 brown_block_1.

9. putdown white_block_3.

10. unstack brown_block_1 green_block_1. But before this step, we need to have held yellow or white_block_1. In step 3, we held yellow, which is before step 10. So constraint 6 is satisfied.

11. putdown brown_block_1. Now, brown is on the table. Goal achieved.

But now, we need to handle constraint 2: after moving brown (which makes green not on the table), ensure white_block_1 is clear.

In step 10, after unstacking brown, green_block_1 is still on white_block_2. So green is not on the table. So according to constraint 2, in that state or later, white_block_1 must be clear. But white_block_1 has white_block_2, which has green_block_1. So we need to move white_block_2.

So steps after 11:

12. unstack green_block_1 white_block_2.

13. putdown green_block_1.

14. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1.

15. putdown white_block_2.

Now, white_block_1 is clear. This satisfies constraint 2.

But this makes the plan longer. Is there a way to avoid these steps?

Wait, the initial state has green not on the table. The plan must ensure that in some state after the initial state, white_block_1 is clear. So even if we just move white_block_2 once, that's enough.

But in the current plan steps 1-11, after step 11, white_block_1 still has white_block_2 and green_block_1 on it. So we need steps 12-15 to clear it. But that's adding four steps. So the total steps would be 15, but that's not optimal.

Alternatively, can we combine some steps?

Wait, after step 7 (stack white_block_3 on brown), we can then unstack brown_block_1 from green_block_1. But no, because brown_block_1 has white_block_3 on top. To unstack brown_block_1, it must be clear. So we need to unstack white_block_3 first.

But the problem is that to unstack brown_block_1 from green_block_1, brown must be clear. So steps 7-9 are necessary.

Alternatively, perhaps stack yellow_block_1 on brown_block_1 instead of white_block_3.

Wait, after step 4: yellow is on orange. To stack on brown, we need to pick up another block, like green_block_1. But green is under brown. So no, can't do that.

Alternatively, after step 4, unstack yellow from orange and stack on brown.

But that requires:

5. unstack yellow_block_1 orange_block_1.

6. stack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1.

But yellow is clear after step 4? No, after stacking, the top block is clear. So after step 4, orange_block_1 has yellow on top, which is clear. So step 5 is possible.

Then step 6: stack yellow on brown.

Now, brown has yellow on top. Then, to get brown to the table:

7. unstack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1.

8. putdown yellow_block_1.

9. unstack brown_block_1 green_block_1.

10. putdown brown_block_1.

This way, constraint 3 is satisfied (step 6: brown has yellow on top).

Constraint 4: before step 6, yellow was on orange (step 4), which is earlier.

Constraint 6: before step 9 (unstack brown), we held yellow in step 5.

So this seems to work.

But also, we need to handle constraint 2. After step 9, green is still on white_block_2. So we need to make sure that white_block_1 becomes clear.

So after step 10:

11. unstack green_block_1 white_block_2.

12. putdown green_block_1.

13. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1.

14. putdown white_block_2.

Now, white_block_1 is clear. So steps 11-14.

But this adds four steps. Is there a shorter way?

Alternatively, after moving brown and green, but that may not help.

Alternatively, when we unstack green_block_1 from white_block_2, can we stack it somewhere else and not put it down? Not sure.

Alternatively, is there a way to have white_block_1 clear earlier?

Wait, during the process of stacking yellow on brown, then unstacking it, perhaps we can use white_block_2 or green_block_1 in a way that clears white_block_1. But I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, maybe we don't need to put green_block_1 and white_block_2 back on the table. But the goal doesn't require that; the goal only specifies brown_block_1 on the table. So leaving green and white_block_2 wherever is fine, as long as all constraints are met.

But the problem is constraint 2 requires that after any state where green is not on the table, white_block_1 must be clear in that state or later. So after step 9, green is not on the table (it's on white_block_2), so we need to have white_block_1 clear in that state or later.

But in step 9, white_block_1 still has white_block_2 and green_block_1 on it. So after step 9, we need to move white_block_2 to clear white_block_1.

But that requires steps 13-14 in the earlier plan.

So this seems unavoidable. But this makes the plan longer. But the problem requires an optimal plan. So maybe there's a shorter path.

Wait, maybe there's a way to use the fact that when we move white_block_3 initially, we can stack it on white_block_1, thereby clearing white_block_1.

Wait, initial state:

white_block_1 has white_block_2, which has green, which has brown.

orange has white_block_3.

yellow is on table.

So steps:

1. unstack white_block_3 orange.

2. stack white_block_3 white_block_1. But white_block_1 has white_block_2 on it. So to stack white_block_3 on white_block_1, we need to have white_block_1 clear. But it's not. So can't do that.

Alternatively, unstack white_block_2 from white_block_1. But white_block_2 has green on it, so need to unstack green first.

So this approach isn't helpful.

Another idea: After moving brown and green, move white_block_2 to the table, which clears white_block_1.

But to move white_block_2, we need to first move green.

So steps:

After putting down brown:

10. unstack green_block_1 white_block_2.

11. putdown green_block_1.

12. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1.

13. putdown white_block_2.

This makes white_block_1 clear. So steps 10-13.

But again, this adds four steps.

Alternatively, can we use some blocks in a different way to minimize steps?

Let me think of the entire plan again, trying to minimize steps while meeting all constraints.

Alternative plan:

1. unstack white_block_3 orange_block_1.

2. putdown white_block_3. (Now orange is clear.)

3. pickup yellow_block_1.

4. stack yellow_block_1 orange_block_1. (Now yellow is on orange, satisfying constraint 4's precondition.)

5. unstack yellow_block_1 orange_block_1. (To use yellow to stack on brown.)

6. stack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1. (Satisfies constraint 3: brown is not clear.)

7. unstack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1. (To clear brown.)

8. putdown yellow_block_1.

9. unstack brown_block_1 green_block_1. (Now, brown is not on green, so constraint 5 is satisfied. Before this, step 3-5 involve holding yellow, satisfying constraint 6.)

10. putdown brown_block_1. (Goal achieved.)

Now, we need to handle constraint 2. After step 9, green is on white_block_2, so not on the table. So we need to ensure that white_block_1 is clear in some state after step 9.

Steps after 10:

11. unstack green_block_1 white_block_2.

12. putdown green_block_1.

13. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1.

14. putdown white_block_2.

This makes white_block_1 clear at step 14. But steps 11-14 are four more steps. Total steps: 14.

But maybe there's a way to combine steps. For example, after step 11, maybe we can stack green_block_1 somewhere else instead of putting it down.

Alternatively, perhaps during the plan, after moving brown and green, we can move white_block_2 to the table, thus clearing white_block_1.

But how?

After step 9: unstack brown_block_1 green_block_1 (brown is held).

Step 10: putdown brown_block_1.

Step 11: unstack green_block_1 white_block_2.

Step 12: putdown green_block_1.

Step 13: unstack white_block_2 white_block_1.

Step 14: putdown white_block_2.

This clears white_block_1. So these steps are necessary.

But this makes the plan 14 steps. Is there a shorter way?

Wait, maybe we can use the pickup of yellow_block_1 to satisfy constraint 6. Step 3 is pickup yellow_block_1, which is before unstacking brown in step 9. So constraint 6 is satisfied.

Now, the constraints:

- Constraint 1: green not on table in initial state. Check.

- Constraint 2: after any state where green is not on table, white_block_1 is clear in that state or later. In steps 0-9, green is not on table. After step 14, white_block_1 is clear. So during steps 0-14, there are states where green is not on table, but after step 14, white_block_1 is clear, satisfying the requirement.

- Constraint 3: step 6 has brown not clear (yellow on top). Check.

- Constraint 4: before step 6, step 4 has yellow on orange. Check.

- Constraint 5: step 9 makes brown not on green. Check.

- Constraint 6: step 3 holds yellow before step 9. Check.

So this plan satisfies all constraints, but has 14 steps. However, maybe there's a shorter way.

Alternative approach: instead of stacking yellow on brown, stack white_block_3 on brown.

Let's try:

1. unstack white_block_3 orange_block_1.

2. stack white_block_3 brown_block_1. (But brown_block_1 is on green_block_1. To stack white_block_3 on brown, we need to have the arm holding white_block_3 and brown be clear. Initially, brown is clear. So:

1. unstack white_block_3 orange_block_1. (Arm now holds white_block_3.)

2. stack white_block_3 brown_block_1. (Now, brown has white_block_3 on top. Satisfies constraint 3.)

3. unstack white_block_3 brown_block_1. (To clear brown.)

4. putdown white_block_3.

5. unstack brown_block_1 green_block_1.

6. putdown brown_block_1. (Goal achieved.)

Now, check constraints:

- Constraint 4: if brown has a block on top (step 2), then in an earlier state, yellow is on orange. But in this plan, we didn't stack yellow on orange. So constraint 4 is not satisfied. So this plan is invalid.

So we need to stack yellow on orange before stacking anything on brown.

So steps:

1. unstack white_block_3 orange_block_1.

2. putdown white_block_3.

3. pickup yellow_block_1.

4. stack yellow_block_1 orange_block_1. (Now, yellow on orange, satisfying constraint 4.)

5. unstack yellow_block_1 orange_block_1.

6. stack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1. (Satisfies constraint 3.)

7. unstack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1.

8. putdown yellow_block_1.

9. unstack brown_block_1 green_block_1.

10. putdown brown_block_1.

Now, constraint 2: after step 9, green is not on table. Need to make white_block_1 clear.

11. unstack green_block_1 white_block_2.

12. putdown green_block_1.

13. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1.

14. putdown white_block_2.

This is 14 steps again.

But maybe there's a way to combine steps. For example, after stacking yellow on orange (step 4), instead of unstacking it, use another block to stack on brown.

But the available blocks are white_block_3, which is on the table after step 2.

So after step 4, orange has yellow. Then:

5. pickup white_block_3.

6. stack white_block_3 brown_block_1. (Satisfies constraint 3.)

7. unstack white_block_3 brown_block_1.

8. putdown white_block_3.

9. unstack brown_block_1 green_block_1.

10. putdown brown_block_1.

Now, constraints:

- Constraint 4: step 4 has yellow on orange, which is before step 6.

- Constraint 3: step 6.

- Constraint 6: step 3 is pickup yellow, which is before step 9.

Then, handle constraint 2:

11. unstack green_block_1 white_block_2.

12. putdown green_block_1.

13. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1.

14. putdown white_block_2.

This is still 14 steps.

But perhaps we can save steps by not moving green and white_block_2, but instead find another way to make white_block_1 clear.

Alternatively, after moving brown, can we stack green_block_1 on white_block_1, thereby clearing white_block_2 and thus white_block_1? No, because green is on white_block_2, and moving green to another place would require moving white_block_2 first.

Hmm. This seems tricky. Maybe the minimal steps are indeed 14, but I'm not sure. Is there a way to avoid some of these steps?

Wait, perhaps when we unstack green_block_1 from white_block_2 (step 11 in some plans), we can stack it on the table, and then unstack white_block_2, but that still requires two steps.

Alternatively, after step 10 (putdown brown), can we unstack white_block_2 from white_block_1 directly? But white_block_2 has green_block_1 on top. So we can't unstack white_block_2 unless it's clear. So need to first unstack green_block_1.

So steps:

10. unstack green_block_1 white_block_2.

11. putdown green_block_1.

12. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1.

13. putdown white_block_2.

This is three steps after putting down brown. So the total steps would be 13.

Wait, in the previous plan:

1. unstack white_block_3 orange_block_1. (1)

2. putdown white_block_3. (2)

3. pickup yellow_block_1. (3)

4. stack yellow_block_1 orange_block_1. (4)

5. pickup white_block_3. (5)

6. stack white_block_3 brown_block_1. (6)

7. unstack white_block_3 brown_block_1. (7)

8. putdown white_block_3. (8)

9. unstack brown_block_1 green_block_1. (9)

10. putdown brown_block_1. (10)

11. unstack green_block_1 white_block_2. (11)

12. putdown green_block_1. (12)

13. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1. (13)

14. putdown white_block_2. (14)

Total steps: 14.

But maybe step 7 and 8 can be skipped by putting white_block_3 somewhere else. For example, after stacking white_block_3 on brown_block_1 (step 6), instead of unstacking it, leave it there. But then brown_block_1 has white_block_3 on top, so we can't unstack brown_block_1 unless we remove white_block_3 first. So steps 7 and 8 are necessary.

Alternatively, can we use a different block to stack on brown_block_1? Like green_block_1. But green_block_1 is under brown_block_1 initially. So no.

Another idea: Instead of stacking white_block_3 on brown_block_1, stack yellow_block_1 after moving it to orange.

But that would require unstacking yellow again.

Alternatively, use yellow_block_1 to stack on brown_block_1, which requires unstacking it from orange_block_1.

But this would add steps.

So perhaps the minimal plan is indeed 14 steps. But I'm not sure. Let me check if there's a shorter way.

Wait, perhaps after step 6 (stack white_block_3 on brown_block_1), we can unstack brown_block_1 from green_block_1. But no, because brown_block_1 has white_block_3 on top. To unstack brown_block_1, it must be clear. So steps 7-8 are necessary to remove white_block_3.

Alternatively, can we put brown_block_1 on the table while it has white_block_3 on top? No, because putdown requires holding the block. If the robotic arm is holding brown_block_1, but it has white_block_3 on top, but the arm can't hold two blocks. So that's not possible.

Hmm. It seems that the constraints force us to have at least 14 steps. But I'm not sure if there's a way to optimize further.

But perhaps there's a smarter way to handle the constraints. Let's think again.

Constraint 2: if green is not on the table, then white_block_1 must be clear in that state or later.

The initial state has green not on the table. So we need white_block_1 clear in some state after the initial state.

If we can make white_block_1 clear once after the initial state, that would satisfy the constraint for all states where green is not on the table, as long as in that state or later, white_block_1 is clear.

So if we can make white_block_1 clear once, that's enough. For example, if we unstack white_block_2 from white_block_1 once, then in all subsequent states, white_block_1 is clear. So even if green is not on the table in earlier states, as long as eventually white_block_1 becomes clear, it's okay.

So perhaps the steps to clear white_block_1 can be done once, and that's sufficient.

So the plan could be:

Steps to satisfy main goal and all constraints:

1. unstack white_block_3 orange_block_1.

2. putdown white_block_3.

3. pickup yellow_block_1.

4. stack yellow_block_1 orange_block_1.

5. unstack yellow_block_1 orange_block_1.

6. stack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1.

7. unstack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1.

8. putdown yellow_block_1.

9. unstack brown_block_1 green_block_1.

10. putdown brown_block_1.

11. unstack green_block_1 white_block_2.

12. putdown green_block_1.

13. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1.

14. putdown white_block_2.

This way, after step 14, white_block_1 is clear, which satisfies constraint 2 for all previous states where green was not on the table.

But this is 14 steps. Is there a way to make it shorter?

Alternatively, after step 10 (putdown brown), can we just unstack white_block_2 from white_block_1, but it has green on top. So no. We need to first move green.

Thus, steps 11-13 are necessary.

Alternative approach: Let's consider that the robotic arm can clear white_block_1 by moving white_block_2, but that requires moving green first. So steps:

After putting down brown_block_1 (step 10):

11. unstack green_block_1 white_block_2.

12. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1.

13. putdown white_block_2.

14. putdown green_block_1.

Wait, no. After step 11 (unstack green_block_1 from white_block_2), the arm is holding green_block_1. Then step 12 requires unstacking white_block_2 from white_block_1, but the arm is holding green_block_1. So that's impossible. So steps must be:

11. unstack green_block_1 white_block_2.

12. putdown green_block_1.

13. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1.

14. putdown white_block_2.

So this adds four steps after step 10.

I think this is the minimal steps required. Thus, the optimal plan would have 14 steps.

But wait, is there a way to integrate some steps?

For example, after unstacking green_block_1 (step 11), can we stack it somewhere else without putting it down?

But the goal doesn't require any specific position for green_block_1, so putting it down is fine.

Alternatively, after step 11, can we stack green_block_1 on another block to save a step? For example, stack green_block_1 on yellow_block_1. But yellow_block_1 is on the table after step 8. So:

11. unstack green_block_1 white_block_2.

12. stack green_block_1 yellow_block_1.

This would save a step (putdown), but stacking requires that yellow_block_1 is clear. After step 8, yellow_block_1 is on the table and clear. So yes.

Then:

13. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1.

14. putdown white_block_2.

Now, white_block_1 is clear. This would save one step (putdown green_block_1).

So steps:

1. unstack white_block_3 orange_block_1.

2. putdown white_block_3.

3. pickup yellow_block_1.

4. stack yellow_block_1 orange_block_1.

5. unstack yellow_block_1 orange_block_1.

6. stack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1.

7. unstack yellow_block_1 brown_block_1.

8. putdown yellow_block_1.

9. unstack brown_block_1 green_block_1.

10. putdown brown_block_1.

11. unstack green_block_1 white_block_2.

12. stack green_block_1 yellow_block_1.

13. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1.

14. putdown white_block_2.

Now, total steps: 14.

But step 12 stacks green_block_1 on yellow_block_1, which makes yellow not clear. But after step 8, yellow is on the table and clear, so step 12 is possible. This saves a step by not putting down green_block_1 but stacking it on yellow. So the total steps are still 14. So no reduction.

Another idea: After step 11 (unstack green_block_1 white_block_2), can we stack green_block_1 on white_block_3, which is on the table?

Yes:

11. unstack green_block_1 white_block_2.

12. stack green_block_1 white_block_3.

13. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1.

14. putdown white_block_2.

This way, step 12 stacks green on white_block_3, which is on the table. This saves a putdown step. So total steps: 14 again.

But whether this is allowed depends on the effects. Stacking green on white_block_3 would require that white_block_3 is clear. After step 2, white_block_3 is on the table and clear. So yes, possible.

But does this save a step? Let's count:

Original steps after step 10:

11. unstack green_block_1 white_block_2.

12. putdown green_block_1.

13. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1.

14. putdown white_block_2.

New steps:

11. unstack green_block_1 white_block_2.

12. stack green_block_1 white_block_3.

13. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1.

14. putdown white_block_2.

So same number of steps. But maybe this allows some other optimizations.

No, not really. The number of steps remains the same.

Therefore, it seems that the minimal plan requires 14 steps. But I'm not entirely sure. However, given the complexity of the constraints, this might be the optimal solution.
