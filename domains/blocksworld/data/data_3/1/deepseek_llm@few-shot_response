Let's break down the problem step by step to find an optimal plan that satisfies all the given constraints.

### Initial State:
- white_block_1 is on the table
- white_block_2 is on top of white_block_1
- green_block_1 is on top of white_block_2
- brown_block_1 is on top of green_block_1
- yellow_block_1 is on the table (clear)
- orange_block_1 is on the table
- white_block_3 is on top of orange_block_1 (clear)
- brown_block_1 is clear
- yellow_block_1 is clear
- white_block_3 is clear
- Not holding any block

### Goal:
- brown_block_1 is on the table

### Constraints:
1. green_block_1 is not on the table (must hold at least once)
2. If green_block_1 is not on the table, then white_block_1 must be clear at that state or later.
3. brown_block_1 is not clear (must hold at least once)
4. If brown_block_1 is not clear, then earlier state must have yellow_block_1 on top of orange_block_1.
5. brown_block_1 is not on top of green_block_1 (must hold at least once)
6. If brown_block_1 is not on top of green_block_1, then earlier state must have holding yellow_block_1 or white_block_1.

### Plan:
To achieve the goal and satisfy all constraints, we need to:
1. Move brown_block_1 to the table. This requires unstacking it from green_block_1 and then putting it down.
2. Ensure all constraints are satisfied during the process.

### Step-by-Step Plan:
1. First, satisfy constraint 4 (yellow_block_1 on top of orange_block_1) before making brown_block_1 not clear.
   - To do this, we need to move white_block_3 from orange_block_1 (since orange_block_1 must be clear to stack yellow_block_1 on it).
   - unstack white_block_3 from orange_block_1 (now holding white_block_3, orange_block_1 is clear).
   - putdown white_block_3 (white_block_3 is on the table, clear).
   - pickup yellow_block_1 (since it's clear and on the table).
   - stack yellow_block_1 on orange_block_1 (now yellow_block_1 is on orange_block_1, satisfying constraint 4).

2. Now, make brown_block_1 not clear (constraint 3). To do this, we need to stack something on brown_block_1. The only clear block available is white_block_3.
   - pickup white_block_3 (clear and on the table).
   - stack white_block_3 on brown_block_1 (now brown_block_1 is not clear, satisfying constraint 3).

3. Now, unstack white_block_3 from brown_block_1 to make brown_block_1 clear again (since we need to move it to the table).
   - unstack white_block_3 from brown_block_1 (now holding white_block_3, brown_block_1 is clear).
   - putdown white_block_3 (white_block_3 is on the table, clear).

4. Now, unstack brown_block_1 from green_block_1 to move it to the table.
   - unstack brown_block_1 from green_block_1 (now holding brown_block_1, green_block_1 is clear).
   - At this point, brown_block_1 is not on top of green_block_1 (satisfying constraint 5), and earlier we were holding yellow_block_1 (satisfying constraint 6).
   - Also, green_block_1 is not on the table (it's on white_block_2, satisfying constraint 1), and white_block_1 is not clear yet (since white_block_2 is on it). We need to ensure white_block_1 becomes clear later.

5. Now, put brown_block_1 on the table to achieve the goal.
   - putdown brown_block_1 (now brown_block_1 is on the table, clear).

6. Finally, to satisfy constraint 2 (if green_block_1 is not on the table, then white_block_1 must be clear at some point), we need to make white_block_1 clear. Currently, white_block_2 is on white_block_1, and green_block_1 is on white_block_2.
   - unstack green_block_1 from white_block_2 (now holding green_block_1, white_block_2 is clear).
   - putdown green_block_1 (green_block_1 is on the table, clear).
   - Now, white_block_2 is clear, so we can unstack it from white_block_1.
   - unstack white_block_2 from white_block_1 (now holding white_block_2, white_block_1 is clear, satisfying constraint 2).
   - putdown white_block_2 (white_block_2 is on the table, clear).

### Final Plan:
```
```
unstack white_block_3 orange_block_1
putdown white_block_3
pickup yellow_block_1
stack yellow_block_1 orange_block_1
pickup white_block_3
stack white_block_3 brown_block_1
unstack white_block_3 brown_block_1
putdown white_block_3
unstack brown_block_1 green_block_1
putdown brown_block_1
unstack green_block_1 white_block_2
putdown green_block_1
unstack white_block_2 white_block_1
putdown white_block_2
```
