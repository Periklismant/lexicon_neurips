1. unstack white_block_3 orange_block_1
2. putdown white_block_3
3. pickup yellow_block_1 (Satisfies the prerequisite for constraint 6)
4. stack yellow_block_1 orange_block_1 (Sets up for constraint 4)
5. pickup white_block_3
6. stack white_block_3 brown_block_1 (Satisfies constraint 3, and since yellow_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1 in step 4, constraint 4 is also satisfied)
7. unstack white_block_3 brown_block_1
8. putdown white_block_3
9. unstack brown_block_1 green_block_1 (Satisfies constraint 5, and since we held yellow_block_1 in step 3, constraint 6 is also satisfied)
10. putdown brown_block_1 (Achieves the main goal)
11. unstack green_block_1 white_block_2
12. putdown green_block_1
13. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1
14. putdown white_block_2 (After this, white_block_1 is clear, which satisfies constraint 2)
