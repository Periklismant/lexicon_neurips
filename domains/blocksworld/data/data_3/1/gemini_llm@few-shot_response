Okay, let's break this down. We need to get brown_block_1 on the table. To do that, we'll need to clear it off the stack it's currently on. This means unstacking brown_block_1 from green_block_1, then unstacking green_block_1 from white_block_2, then unstacking white_block_2 from white_block_1. Then we can putdown brown_block_1.

Here's the plan, keeping the constraints in mind:

```
```
unstack brown_block_1 green_block_1
putdown brown_block_1
```
