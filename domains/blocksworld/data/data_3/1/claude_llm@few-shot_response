I'll solve this planning problem step by step, considering all the constraints.

First, let me analyze the initial state and goal:
- Initial state: brown_block_1 is on top of green_block_1, which is on top of white_block_2, which is on top of white_block_1 on the table. Also, yellow_block_1 is on the table, orange_block_1 is on the table with white_block_3 on top of it.
- Goal: brown_block_1 is on the table.

Now, let's consider the constraints:
1. green_block_1 must not be on the table at some point
2. If green_block_1 is not on the table, then white_block_1 must be clear at that point or later
3. brown_block_1 must not be clear at some point
4. If brown_block_1 is not clear, then yellow_block_1 must have been on top of orange_block_1 earlier
5. brown_block_1 must not be on top of green_block_1 at some point
6. If brown_block_1 is not on top of green_block_1, then earlier we must have been holding yellow_block_1 or white_block_1

Let me plan a solution:

```
unstack brown_block_1 green_block_1
putdown brown_block_1
unstack green_block_1 white_block_2
stack green_block_1 brown_block_1
unstack white_block_2 white_block_1
putdown white_block_2
pickup yellow_block_1
stack yellow_block_1 orange_block_1
unstack white_block_3 orange_block_1
stack white_block_3 green_block_1
unstack green_block_1 brown_block_1
putdown green_block_1
```
