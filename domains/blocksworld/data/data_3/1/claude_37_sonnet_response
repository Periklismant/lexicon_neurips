Alright, let's break this problem down to understand the system and the constraints we need to meet.

First, let's outline the initial state:

1. Stack: brown_block_1 on top of green_block_1 on top of white_block_2 on top of white_block_1, which is on the table.
2. yellow_block_1 on the table.
3. white_block_3 on top of orange_block_1, which is on the table.
4. The blocks brown_block_1, yellow_block_1, and white_block_3 are clear (no blocks on top of them).
5. The arm is not holding any block.

Our goal is to bring brown_block_1 to the table.

Now, let's understand the constraints:

1. green_block_1 must at some point not be on the table.
   - Actually, green_block_1 starts not on the table in the initial state, so we don't need to worry about this constraint.

2. If green_block_1 is not on the table, then white_block_1 must be clear at that state or a future state.
   - green_block_1 starts not on the table, so at some point, we need to ensure white_block_1 becomes clear.

3. At some point, brown_block_1 must not be clear (i.e., there should be a block on top of it).
   - brown_block_1 starts clear, so we need to place a block on top of it at some point.

4. If brown_block_1 is not clear, then yellow_block_1 must be on top of orange_block_1 in an earlier state.
   - This means before we place a block on top of brown_block_1, we need to put yellow_block_1 on top of orange_block_1.

5. At some point, brown_block_1 must not be on top of green_block_1.
   - This is already what we're aiming for in our goal, so we'll satisfy this.

6. If brown_block_1 is not on top of green_block_1, then at an earlier state, you must have been holding either yellow_block_1 or white_block_1.
   - This means that to remove brown_block_1 from green_block_1, we first must have held yellow_block_1 or white_block_1.

Let's start planning:

Initial Step: The arm is not holding any block. We need to hold either yellow_block_1 or white_block_1 before we can remove brown_block_1 from green_block_1.

Since yellow_block_1 is on the table and clear, we can pick it up.

1. pickup yellow_block_1

Now, we need to place yellow_block_1 on top of orange_block_1, because of constraint 4.

2. stack yellow_block_1 orange_block_1

Now, we need to ensure white_block_1 becomes clear (constraint 2). For this, we need to remove all the blocks on top of it. Since brown_block_1 is on top of green_block_1, on top of white_block_2, on top of white_block_1, we need to first unstack brown_block_1. But before we do that, constraint 3 says that at some point, brown_block_1 must have a block on top of it. So, we need to place a block on top of brown_block_1 before we move it.

White_block_3 is currently clear and on top of orange_block_1. We can use it.

3. unstack white_block_3 orange_block_1
4. stack white_block_3 brown_block_1

Now white_block_3 is on top of brown_block_1, so brown_block_1 is not clear, fulfilling constraint 3. Now we can move white_block_3 and then brown_block_1.

Wait, this won't work directly because to move brown_block_1, we need to remove white_block_3 first, which would make brown_block_1 clear again.

Actually, it says "At some point", not that it must remain the case. So as long as there is a block on top of brown_block_1 at some time, it's fine even if brown_block_1 becomes clear later.

Let's revise our plan:

1. pickup yellow_block_1
2. stack yellow_block_1 orange_block_1 (this fulfills the requirement for constraint 4)

Now, let's put a block on top of brown_block_1 (to satisfy constraint 3) and then move brown_block_1 to the table (our main goal).

3. unstack white_block_3 orange_block_1
4. stack white_block_3 brown_block_1 (this satisfies constraint 3)
5. unstack white_block_3 brown_block_1
6. putdown white_block_3
7. unstack brown_block_1 green_block_1 (this satisfies constraint 5, and the prerequisite of holding either yellow_block_1 or white_block_1 earlier was satisfied)
8. putdown brown_block_1 (this achieves our main goal)

After step 7, white_block_1 is not yet clear (it's still under white_block_2 and green_block_1). To satisfy constraint 2, we need to make white_block_1 clear after this point.

9. unstack green_block_1 white_block_2
10. putdown green_block_1
11. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1

Now, white_block_1 is clear, which satisfies constraint 2.

Actually, wait, I think I misunderstood a couple of constraints. Let's look at them again:

Constraint 1: "green_block_1 is not on the table" must be true in at least one state.
- This is true in the initial state.

Constraint 2: If "green_block_1 is not on the table" holds in a state s, then "white_block_1 is clear" must be true in state s or a later state.
- green_block_1 is not on the table in the initial state, so we need to ensure white_block_1 is clear at some point.

Constraint 3: "brown_block_1 is not clear" must be true in at least one state.
- This means we need to place a block on top of brown_block_1.

Constraint 4: If "brown_block_1 is not clear" is true in a state, then "yellow_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1" must be true in an earlier state.
- Before we place a block on top of brown_block_1, we need to place yellow_block_1 on top of orange_block_1.

Constraint 5: "brown_block_1 is not on top of green_block_1" must be true in at least one state.
- We just need to make sure brown_block_1 is not on top of green_block_1 at some point.

Constraint 6: If "brown_block_1 is not on top of green_block_1" is true in a state, then in an earlier state, you must have held either yellow_block_1 or white_block_1.
- Before brown_block_1 is not on top of green_block_1, you must have held either yellow_block_1 or white_block_1.

So, to satisfy constraint 6, I need to pick up yellow_block_1 or white_block_1 before moving brown_block_1.

Let me reconsider my plan:

1. pickup yellow_block_1 (this will satisfy the prerequisite for constraint 6)
2. stack yellow_block_1 orange_block_1 (this sets up for constraint 4)
3. unstack white_block_3 orange_block_1
4. stack white_block_3 brown_block_1 (this satisfies constraint 3, and since yellow_block_1 is already on top of orange_block_1, constraint 4 is satisfied)
5. unstack white_block_3 brown_block_1
6. putdown white_block_3
7. unstack brown_block_1 green_block_1 (this satisfies constraint 5, and since we held yellow_block_1 earlier, constraint 6 is satisfied)
8. putdown brown_block_1 (this achieves our main goal)

But I still need to make white_block_1 clear to satisfy constraint 2. Let me continue:

9. unstack green_block_1 white_block_2
10. putdown green_block_1
11. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1
12. putdown white_block_2

Now, white_block_1 is clear, which satisfies constraint 2.

So, my plan is:

1. pickup yellow_block_1
2. stack yellow_block_1 orange_block_1
3. unstack white_block_3 orange_block_1
4. stack white_block_3 brown_block_1
5. unstack white_block_3 brown_block_1
6. putdown white_block_3
7. unstack brown_block_1 green_block_1
8. putdown brown_block_1
9. unstack green_block_1 white_block_2
10. putdown green_block_1
11. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1
12. putdown white_block_2

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating. Let's try to find the shortest valid plan to achieve our goal, which is to have brown_block_1 on the table, while ensuring all constraints are satisfied.

Initial state:
- Stack: brown_block_1 (clear) → green_block_1 → white_block_2 → white_block_1 (on table)
- yellow_block_1 (clear, on table)
- white_block_3 (clear) → orange_block_1 (on table)
- Arm is empty.

Let's start with the most basic plan to get brown_block_1 to the table, which would be:
1. unstack brown_block_1 green_block_1
2. putdown brown_block_1

But we need to ensure all constraints are satisfied. Constraint 6 says before brown_block_1 is not on top of green_block_1, we must have held yellow_block_1 or white_block_1. So:

1. pickup yellow_block_1 (satisfies the prerequisite for constraint 6)
2. ... (we need to put yellow_block_1 somewhere)
3. unstack brown_block_1 green_block_1
4. putdown brown_block_1

But constraint 4 says before brown_block_1 is not clear, yellow_block_1 must be on top of orange_block_1. So we need to place yellow_block_1 on orange_block_1 before placing a block on brown_block_1.

1. pickup yellow_block_1
2. stack yellow_block_1 orange_block_1 (sets up for constraint 4)
3. ... (we still need to make brown_block_1 not clear at some point)
4. unstack brown_block_1 green_block_1
5. putdown brown_block_1

To make brown_block_1 not clear, we can place a block on top of it. white_block_3 is a good candidate.

1. pickup yellow_block_1
2. stack yellow_block_1 orange_block_1
3. unstack white_block_3 orange_block_1
4. stack white_block_3 brown_block_1 (satisfies constraint 3, and since yellow_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1, constraint 4 is satisfied)
5. unstack white_block_3 brown_block_1
6. putdown white_block_3
7. unstack brown_block_1 green_block_1 (satisfies constraint 5, and since we held yellow_block_1 earlier, constraint 6 is satisfied)
8. putdown brown_block_1 (main goal achieved)

Now, to satisfy constraint 2, we need to make white_block_1 clear after green_block_1 is not on the table. green_block_1 is not on the table in the initial state, so we need to make white_block_1 clear at some point. After step 8, green_block_1 is still not on the table and white_block_1 is not clear. So we need to continue:

9. unstack green_block_1 white_block_2
10. putdown green_block_1
11. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1
12. putdown white_block_2

Now, white_block_1 is clear, which satisfies constraint 2.

Actually, that's a lot of steps. Let me think carefully about the constraints and see if there's a shorter path:

1. "green_block_1 is not on the table" must be true in at least one state.
   - This is true in the initial state, so nothing special we need to do.

2. If "green_block_1 is not on the table" holds in a state s, then "white_block_1 is clear" must be true in state s or a later state.
   - Initially, green_block_1 is not on the table, so at some point in our plan, white_block_1 must be clear.

3. "brown_block_1 is not clear" must be true in at least one state.
   - We need to place a block on top of brown_block_1 at some point.

4. If "brown_block_1 is not clear" is true in a state, then "yellow_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1" must be true in an earlier state.
   - Before we place a block on top of brown_block_1, we need to place yellow_block_1 on top of orange_block_1.

5. "brown_block_1 is not on top of green_block_1" must be true in at least one state.
   - This will be true once we remove brown_block_1 from green_block_1.

6. If "brown_block_1 is not on top of green_block_1" is true in a state, then in an earlier state, you must have held either yellow_block_1 or white_block_1.
   - Before we remove brown_block_1 from green_block_1, we must hold either yellow_block_1 or white_block_1.

It's a bit clearer now. Let's try a streamlined plan:

1. pickup yellow_block_1 (this satisfies the prerequisite for constraint 6)
2. stack yellow_block_1 orange_block_1 (this sets up for constraint 4)
3. unstack white_block_3 orange_block_1
4. stack white_block_3 brown_block_1 (this satisfies constraint 3, and since yellow_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1, constraint 4 is satisfied)
5. unstack white_block_3 brown_block_1
6. putdown white_block_3
7. unstack brown_block_1 green_block_1 (this satisfies constraint 5, and since we held yellow_block_1 earlier, constraint 6 is satisfied)
8. putdown brown_block_1 (this achieves our main goal)

Now, we still need to make white_block_1 clear to satisfy constraint 2. To do this, we need to remove white_block_2 and then green_block_1. But we can't directly unstack green_block_1 because it's not clear.

Actually, huh, in the state after step 8, brown_block_1 is on the table, but white_block_1 is still not clear. green_block_1 is on top of white_block_2, which is on top of white_block_1. To make white_block_1 clear, we need to unstack both green_block_1 and white_block_2.

Let me reorganize and ensure I'm tracking the state after each step:

Initial state:
- Stack: brown_block_1 (clear) → green_block_1 → white_block_2 → white_block_1 (on table)
- yellow_block_1 (clear, on table)
- white_block_3 (clear) → orange_block_1 (on table)
- Arm is empty.

1. pickup yellow_block_1 (Constraint 6 prerequisite satisfied)
   State: Arm holds yellow_block_1, rest unchanged.
2. stack yellow_block_1 orange_block_1 (Constraint 4 setup)
   State: yellow_block_1 (clear) → orange_block_1 (on table), rest unchanged.
3. unstack white_block_3 orange_block_1
   State: Arm holds white_block_3, orange_block_1 (clear, on table), rest unchanged.
4. stack white_block_3 brown_block_1 (Constraint 3 satisfied)
   State: white_block_3 (clear) → brown_block_1 → green_block_1 → white_block_2 → white_block_1 (on table), orange_block_1 (clear, on table), yellow_block_1 (clear) → orange_block_1 (on table)
   // Wait, this is wrong, I can't stack both yellow_block_1 and white_block_3 on orange_block_1.
   // I think was confused, let me try again.

Initial state:
- Stack: brown_block_1 (clear) → green_block_1 → white_block_2 → white_block_1 (on table)
- yellow_block_1 (clear, on table)
- white_block_3 (clear) → orange_block_1 (on table)
- Arm is empty.

1. pickup yellow_block_1 (Constraint 6 prerequisite satisfied)
   State: Arm holds yellow_block_1, rest unchanged.
2. stack yellow_block_1 orange_block_1 (Constraint 4 setup)
   State: yellow_block_1 (clear) → orange_block_1 (on table), white_block_3 (clear) → orange_block_1 (on table), rest unchanged.

Uh oh, I can't stack yellow_block_1 on orange_block_1 if white_block_3 is already on orange_block_1. I've been making a mistake. Let's rethink the plan.

Initial state:
- Stack: brown_block_1 (clear) → green_block_1 → white_block_2 → white_block_1 (on table)
- yellow_block_1 (clear, on table)
- white_block_3 (clear) → orange_block_1 (on table)
- Arm is empty.

Actually, hold on, I'm still having some misconceptions. Let me re-parse the initial state:

- "white_block_1 is on the table"
- "white_block_2 is on top of white_block_1"
- "green_block_1 is on top of white_block_2"
- "brown_block_1 is on top of green_block_1"
- "yellow_block_1 is on the table"
- "orange_block_1 is on the table"
- "white_block_3 is on top of orange_block_1"

So, the stacks are:
1. brown_block_1 (clear) → green_block_1 → white_block_2 → white_block_1 (on table)
2. yellow_block_1 (clear, on table)
3. white_block_3 (clear) → orange_block_1 (on table)

- "there is no block on top of brown_block_1, i.e., brown_block_1 is clear"
- "there is no block on top of yellow_block_1, i.e., yellow_block_1 is clear"
- "there is no block on top of white_block_3, i.e., white_block_3 is clear"
- "you are not holding any block"

This matches what I have. So let me continue. To place yellow_block_1 on top of orange_block_1, I need to first remove white_block_3.

1. unstack white_block_3 orange_block_1
   State: Arm holds white_block_3, orange_block_1 (clear, on table), rest unchanged.
2. putdown white_block_3
   State: white_block_3 (clear, on table), orange_block_1 (clear, on table), rest unchanged.
3. pickup yellow_block_1 (Constraint 6 prerequisite satisfied)
   State: Arm holds yellow_block_1, white_block_3 (clear, on table), orange_block_1 (clear, on table), rest unchanged.
4. stack yellow_block_1 orange_block_1 (Constraint 4 setup)
   State: yellow_block_1 (clear) → orange_block_1 (on table), white_block_3 (clear, on table), rest unchanged.
5. pickup white_block_3
   State: Arm holds white_block_3, yellow_block_1 (clear) → orange_block_1 (on table), rest unchanged.
6. stack white_block_3 brown_block_1 (Constraint 3 satisfied)
   State: white_block_3 (clear) → brown_block_1 → green_block_1 → white_block_2 → white_block_1 (on table), yellow_block_1 (clear) → orange_block_1 (on table)
7. unstack white_block_3 brown_block_1
   State: Arm holds white_block_3, brown_block_1 (clear) → green_block_1 → white_block_2 → white_block_1 (on table), yellow_block_1 (clear) → orange_block_1 (on table)
8. putdown white_block_3
   State: white_block_3 (clear, on table), brown_block_1 (clear) → green_block_1 → white_block_2 → white_block_1 (on table), yellow_block_1 (clear) → orange_block_1 (on table)
9. unstack brown_block_1 green_block_1 (Constraint 5 satisfied)
   State: Arm holds brown_block_1, green_block_1 (clear) → white_block_2 → white_block_1 (on table), white_block_3 (clear, on table), yellow_block_1 (clear) → orange_block_1 (on table)
10. putdown brown_block_1 (Main goal achieved)
    State: brown_block_1 (clear, on table), green_block_1 (clear) → white_block_2 → white_block_1 (on table), white_block_3 (clear, on table), yellow_block_1 (clear) → orange_block_1 (on table)

Now, to satisfy constraint 2, we need to make white_block_1 clear. For that, we need to unstack green_block_1 and white_block_2.

11. unstack green_block_1 white_block_2
    State: Arm holds green_block_1, white_block_2 (clear) → white_block_1 (on table), brown_block_1 (clear, on table), white_block_3 (clear, on table), yellow_block_1 (clear) → orange_block_1 (on table)
12. putdown green_block_1
    State: green_block_1 (clear, on table), white_block_2 (clear) → white_block_1 (on table), brown_block_1 (clear, on table), white_block_3 (clear, on table), yellow_block_1 (clear) → orange_block_1 (on table)
13. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1
    State: Arm holds white_block_2, white_block_1 (clear, on table), green_block_1 (clear, on table), brown_block_1 (clear, on table), white_block_3 (clear, on table), yellow_block_1 (clear) → orange_block_1 (on table)
14. putdown white_block_2
    State: white_block_2 (clear, on table), white_block_1 (clear, on table), green_block_1 (clear, on table), brown_block_1 (clear, on table), white_block_3 (clear, on table), yellow_block_1 (clear) → orange_block_1 (on table)

Now, white_block_1 is clear, which satisfies constraint 2.

But wait, let's check if this plan is really the most efficient:
- To satisfy constraint 6, we need to pick up yellow_block_1 or white_block_1 before moving brown_block_1.
- To satisfy constraint 3, we need to place a block on top of brown_block_1.
- To satisfy constraint 4, we need to place yellow_block_1 on top of orange_block_1 before satisfying constraint 3.

White_block_1 is at the bottom of a stack, so picking up yellow_block_1 seems more efficient (which is what we did). Then, to satisfy constraint 4, we need to place yellow_block_1 on orange_block_1. We could skip steps 1-2 (unstack white_block_3 and putdown) and directly stack yellow_block_1 on orange_block_1, but then we'd need to remove yellow_block_1 to place it on brown_block_1, which would take more steps.

Hmm, let me redraw the initial state again to make sure:

- brown_block_1 (clear) → green_block_1 → white_block_2 → white_block_1 (on table)
- yellow_block_1 (clear, on table)
- white_block_3 (clear) → orange_block_1 (on table)

Actually, I think I misunderstood constraint 3 and 4. Constraint 3 says "brown_block_1 is not clear" must be true in at least one state. And constraint 4 says if "brown_block_1 is not clear" is true, then "yellow_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1" must be true in an earlier state.

So it's not about placing a specific block on top of brown_block_1, but just making sure brown_block_1 is not clear at some point, with the constraint that yellow_block_1 must be on top of orange_block_1 earlier.

This means I can simplify my plan:

1. unstack white_block_3 orange_block_1
   State: Arm holds white_block_3, orange_block_1 (clear, on table), rest unchanged.
2. putdown white_block_3
   State: white_block_3 (clear, on table), orange_block_1 (clear, on table), rest unchanged.
3. pickup yellow_block_1 (Constraint 6 prerequisite satisfied)
   State: Arm holds yellow_block_1, white_block_3 (clear, on table), orange_block_1 (clear, on table), rest unchanged.
4. stack yellow_block_1 orange_block_1 (Constraint 4 setup)
   State: yellow_block_1 (clear) → orange_block_1 (on table), white_block_3 (clear, on table), rest unchanged.
5. pickup white_block_3
   State: Arm holds white_block_3, yellow_block_1 (clear) → orange_block_1 (on table), rest unchanged.
6. stack white_block_3 brown_block_1 (Constraint 3 satisfied)
   State: white_block_3 (clear) → brown_block_1 → green_block_1 → white_block_2 → white_block_1 (on table), yellow_block_1 (clear) → orange_block_1 (on table)
7. unstack white_block_3 brown_block_1
   State: Arm holds white_block_3, brown_block_1 (clear) → green_block_1 → white_block_2 → white_block_1 (on table), yellow_block_1 (clear) → orange_block_1 (on table)
8. putdown white_block_3
   State: white_block_3 (clear, on table), brown_block_1 (clear) → green_block_1 → white_block_2 → white_block_1 (on table), yellow_block_1 (clear) → orange_block_1 (on table)
9. unstack brown_block_1 green_block_1 (Constraint 5 satisfied)
   State: Arm holds brown_block_1, green_block_1 (clear) → white_block_2 → white_block_1 (on table), white_block_3 (clear, on table), yellow_block_1 (clear) → orange_block_1 (on table)
10. putdown brown_block_1 (Main goal achieved)
    State: brown_block_1 (clear, on table), green_block_1 (clear) → white_block_2 → white_block_1 (on table), white_block_3 (clear, on table), yellow_block_1 (clear) → orange_block_1 (on table)
11. unstack green_block_1 white_block_2
    State: Arm holds green_block_1, white_block_2 (clear) → white_block_1 (on table), brown_block_1 (clear, on table), white_block_3 (clear, on table), yellow_block_1 (clear) → orange_block_1 (on table)
12. putdown green_block_1
    State: green_block_1 (clear, on table), white_block_2 (clear) → white_block_1 (on table), brown_block_1 (clear, on table), white_block_3 (clear, on table), yellow_block_1 (clear) → orange_block_1 (on table)
13. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1
    State: Arm holds white_block_2, white_block_1 (clear, on table), green_block_1 (clear, on table), brown_block_1 (clear, on table), white_block_3 (clear, on table), yellow_block_1 (clear) → orange_block_1 (on table)
14. putdown white_block_2
    State: white_block_2 (clear, on table), white_block_1 (clear, on table), green_block_1 (clear, on table), brown_block_1 (clear, on table), white_block_3 (clear, on table), yellow_block_1 (clear) → orange_block_1 (on table)

Wait, but there's an issue with constraint 4. It says if "brown_block_1 is not clear" is true, then "yellow_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1" must be true in an earlier state.

In our plan, at step 6, brown_block_1 is not clear because white_block_3 is on top of it. And at this point, yellow_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1, which is what we set up in step 4. So, constraint 4 is satisfied.

Actually, let's check if this plan can be further optimized.

I wonder if we even need to clear white_block_1. Constraint 2 says if "green_block_1 is not on the table" holds in a state s, then "white_block_1 is clear" must be true in state s or a later state. In our plan, green_block_1 is not on the table in the initial state, and later on in the future it is moved. We need to ensure white_block_1 becomes clear at some point.

Actually yes, to fully satisfy constraint 2, we need to make white_block_1 clear. I'm inclined to believe that steps 11-14 are necessary to satisfy constraint 2.

Let's double-check if our plan works and if there are any constraints we might have missed:

1. "green_block_1 is not on the table" must be true in at least one state.
   - This is true in the initial state, so no action needed.

2. If "green_block_1 is not on the table" holds in a state s, then "white_block_1 is clear" must be true in state s or a later state.
   - green_block_1 is not on the table in the initial state, and white_block_1 becomes clear in the end, so this is satisfied.

3. "brown_block_1 is not clear" must be true in at least one state.
   - brown_block_1 is not clear at step 6, so this is satisfied.

4. If "brown_block_1 is not clear" is true in a state, then "yellow_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1" must be true in an earlier state.
   - At step 6, brown_block_1 is not clear, and at step 4, yellow_block_1 is placed on top of orange_block_1, so this is satisfied.

5. "brown_block_1 is not on top of green_block_1" must be true in at least one state.
   - This becomes true at step 9, so it's satisfied.

6. If "brown_block_1 is not on top of green_block_1" is true in a state, then in an earlier state, you must have held either yellow_block_1 or white_block_1.
   - brown_block_1 is not on top of green_block_1 at step 9, and at step 3, we held yellow_block_1, so this is satisfied.

All constraints are satisfied, and our main goal is achieved.

So, here's the final plan:

1. unstack white_block_3 orange_block_1
2. putdown white_block_3
3. pickup yellow_block_1
4. stack yellow_block_1 orange_block_1
5. pickup white_block_3
6. stack white_block_3 brown_block_1
7. unstack white_block_3 brown_block_1
8. putdown white_block_3
9. unstack brown_block_1 green_block_1
10. putdown brown_block_1
11. unstack green_block_1 white_block_2
12. putdown green_block_1
13. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1
14. putdown white_block_2

I'm satisfied that this plan achieves our goal and satisfies all the constraints.

But let me check my understanding of constraint 2 again. It says if green_block_1 is not on the table in a state s, white_block_1 must be clear in state s or a later state. Given that green_block_1 is initially not on the table, white_block_1 must become clear at some point. A shorter plan would just unstack brown_block_1 and put it on the table, but that wouldn't make white_block_1 clear, so steps 11-14 are necessary.

I think the plan I have is the most efficient way to achieve the goal while satisfying all the constraints. 

Actually, there's one more constraint I missed, let me reread them:

If expression "brown_block_1 is not on top of green_block_1" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: "At least one of the following conditions is true: "you are holding yellow_block_1", "you are holding white_block_1""

This means that before we satisfy constraint 5 (brown_block_1 is not on top of green_block_1), we must have held either yellow_block_1 or white_block_1. In our plan, we hold yellow_block_1 at step 3, and brown_block_1 is not on top of green_block_1 at step 9, which is after we held yellow_block_1, so this constraint is also satisfied.

I think we're all set:

1. unstack white_block_3 orange_block_1
2. putdown white_block_3
3. pickup yellow_block_1 (Satisfies the prerequisite for constraint 6)
4. stack yellow_block_1 orange_block_1 (Sets up for constraint 4)
5. pickup white_block_3
6. stack white_block_3 brown_block_1 (Satisfies constraint 3, and since yellow_block_1 is on top of orange_block_1 in step 4, constraint 4 is also satisfied)
7. unstack white_block_3 brown_block_1
8. putdown white_block_3
9. unstack brown_block_1 green_block_1 (Satisfies constraint 5, and since we held yellow_block_1 in step 3, constraint 6 is also satisfied)
10. putdown brown_block_1 (Achieves the main goal)
11. unstack green_block_1 white_block_2
12. putdown green_block_1
13. unstack white_block_2 white_block_1
14. putdown white_block_2 (After this, white_block_1 is clear, which satisfies constraint 2)

This plan satisfies all the constraints and achieves the main goal. I think we're good to go!
