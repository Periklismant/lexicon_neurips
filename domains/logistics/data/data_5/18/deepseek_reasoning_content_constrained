Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. So, the goal is to get package p1 to l1_3 and p2 to l1_5. But there are a bunch of constraints we need to satisfy along the way. Let me break this down step by step.

First, let's look at the initial state. Both p1 and p2 are in their respective cities. p1 is in l1_4 (city c1), and p2 is in l2_3 (city c2). The trucks and airplanes are in various locations. Trucks t1 and t2 are in l1_4 and l2_3, respectively. Airplanes a1 and a2 are in their airports l1_1 and l2_1.

The goal is to have p1 in l1_3 (which is in c1) and p2 in l1_5 (also in c1). So p2 needs to move from c2 to c1. Since airplanes can move between airports, maybe we need to fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1, carry p2 there, then use a truck in c1 to move it to l1_5. But let's check the constraints.

Constraints:
1. p2 must be in l2_4 at some point.
2. p2 must be in l1_7 at some point.
3. At least one of p1 in t2 or p2 in a1 must be true at some state.
4. p2 must be in l1_1 at some point.
5. If p2 is in l1_1, then either p2 is in l1_7 or p1 is in l1_1 must hold in that state or later.
6. p2 must be in a2 at some point.
7. If p2 is in a2, then either p1 is in a2 or p1 is in l2_5 must hold in that state or later.

Hmm, okay. Let's see how to satisfy all these.

Starting with p2. Since it's in l2_3 (city c2), to get it to c1, we need to get it to an airport in c2 (like l2_1), then fly it to c1's airport l1_1. But let's check the steps.

First, move p2 from l2_3 to l2_4 (to satisfy constraint 1). Since l2_3 and l2_4 are both in c2, maybe use truck t2 (which is at l2_3 initially). So drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_4, then unload p2 there. Then, maybe drive t2 to l2_1 (airport in c2) to load p2 onto a2.

Wait, but a2 is initially at l2_1. So if we drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1, then load p2 into a2. Then fly a2 to l1_1. Then unload p2 at l1_1, then use a truck in c1 (t1 is in l1_4 initially) to move p2 to l1_5. But we also need to get p2 to l1_7 and l1_1. Let's see.

But first, the steps:

For p2:
- Load p2 into t2 at l2_3 (since t2 is there). Wait, initial state says "Package t2 is in location l2_3". Wait, wait, the original state says "Package t2 is in location l2_3". Wait, that's a typo? Because t2 is a truck. Wait, looking back: The original state includes "Package t1 is in location l1_4", "Package t2 is in location l2_3", "Package p1 is in location l1_4", etc. Wait, that must be a mistake. Because t1 and t2 are trucks, not packages. So maybe that's a misstatement. Wait, the user might have made a typo. Let me check again.

Wait, the original state says:

"Package t1 is in location l1_4"
"Package t2 is in location l2_3"
"Package p1 is in location l1_4"
"Package p2 is in location l2_3"
"Package a1 is in location l1_1"
"Package a2 is in location l2_1"

Wait, this is confusing. Trucks t1 and t2 are packages? Or is this a mistake. Because in the objects list, we have "truck t1", "truck t2", "package p1", "package p2", etc. So the original state seems to have entries like "Package t1 is in location l1_4" which is incorrect. Because t1 is a truck, not a package. This must be a mistake in the problem statement. Similarly, "Package a1 is in location l1_1"â€”a1 is an airplane, not a package.

This is a problem. Because if the initial state says that trucks and airplanes are packages, then loading them into other vehicles would be possible, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps this is a typo. The correct initial state should be:

"Truck t1 is in location l1_4"
"Truck t2 is in location l2_3"
"Airplane a1 is in location l1_1"
"Airplane a2 is in location l2_1"
And the packages p1 and p2 are in their respective locations.

Assuming that the problem statement has a typo, and the correct initial positions are:

- Truck t1 is at l1_4
- Truck t2 is at l2_3
- Airplane a1 is at l1_1
- Airplane a2 is at l2_1
- Packages p1 is at l1_4
- Package p2 is at l2_3

Because otherwise, the problem is impossible. For example, if t1 is a package, then you can't drive it. So I'll proceed under that assumption.

So, initial state:

p1 is in l1_4 (c1), with truck t1 also there.
p2 is in l2_3 (c2), with truck t2 also there.
Airplanes a1 in l1_1 (c1), a2 in l2_1 (c2).

Now, the goal is p1 in l1_3 (c1) and p2 in l1_5 (c1). So p1 needs to move within c1, and p2 needs to move from c2 to c1.

Let's handle p1 first. Since p1 is in l1_4 (c1), and t1 is there. So load p1 into t1, drive t1 to l1_3, unload. That's straightforward.

But for p2, need to get it from l2_3 (c2) to l1_5 (c1). So steps would involve moving p2 via truck to an airport in c2, load into airplane, fly to c1's airport, unload, then truck to l1_5.

But also, need to satisfy the constraints.

Constraints for p2:

- Must be in l2_4 (so at some point, move it there)
- Must be in l1_7 (so after arriving in c1, need to take it there)
- Must be in l1_1 (so after flying to c1's airport l1_1, that's covered)
- Must be in a2 (so load into a2 in c2, which would be at l2_1, so need to move p2 to l2_1, load into a2, then fly to l1_1)
- Also, after p2 is in a2 (when loaded into a2), we need either p1 in a2 or p1 in l2_5. But p1 is in c1, so getting it to l2_5 (which is in c2) would require flying it there. That seems complicated. Alternatively, if p1 is in a2, but a2 is moving from c2 to c1. So maybe after a2 arrives in c1, p1 is loaded into a2? But p1 is supposed to end up in l1_3, so that might not be feasible. Hmm, this constraint is tricky.

Also, the constraint that if p2 is in l1_1, then either p2 is in l1_7 or p1 is in l1_1 must hold at or after that state. Since p2 is in l1_1 when unloaded from a2, then we need to ensure that later p2 is moved to l1_7 (since p1's goal is l1_3, not l1_1). So after unloading p2 at l1_1, we can drive it to l1_7 (using a truck in c1), then to l1_5.

But let's outline the steps.

For p2:

1. Move p2 from l2_3 to l2_4 using truck t2. (satisfy constraint 1)
   - drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
   - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
2. Then, move p2 to l2_1 (airport in c2). So drive t2 to l2_1.
   - drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
   - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (wait, no. Wait, after step 1, p2 is in l2_4. So truck t2 is in l2_4. So need to drive t2 to l2_1. Then load p2 into a2 at l2_1. But first, need to have p2 in l2_1. Wait, after step 1, p2 is in l2_4. So to get it to l2_1, perhaps use truck t2 again. So drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1, then load p2 into t2 (if t2 is there). Wait, no: after unloading p2 at l2_4, t2 is in l2_4. So to move p2 to l2_1, we need to load it back into t2, drive to l2_1, then unload. But maybe that's not necessary. Wait, let me re-examine.

Wait, after step 1, p2 is in l2_4. To get it to l2_1 (airport), we can use another truck? But according to the objects, the trucks are t1 (in c1) and t2 (in c2). So t2 is in c2. So after step 1, t2 is in l2_4. So drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1. Then load p2 into t2 again (but p2 is in l2_4, not in t2 anymore). Wait, no: after step 1, p2 is unloaded from t2 into l2_4. So to get p2 to l2_1, we need to load it back into t2 at l2_4, then drive to l2_1, then unload. So steps:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
2. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (now p2 is in l2_4, t2 is in l2_4)
3. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (precondition: p2 and t2 are in l2_4)
4. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
5. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (now p2 is in l2_1)
6. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (since a2 is at l2_1)
7. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
8. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (now p2 is in l1_1, satisfying constraint 4)
Then, to get p2 from l1_1 to l1_7 (constraint 2), need to use a truck in c1. The trucks in c1 are t1 (initially at l1_4). So perhaps:

9. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (but t1 is at l1_4. So need to move t1 to l1_1 first. Wait, t1 starts at l1_4. So drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1:

But wait, handling p1 first might be better. Let's think about p1's plan.

For p1:

Initial location: l1_4. Needs to go to l1_3. Truck t1 is at l1_4. So load p1 into t1, drive to l1_3, unload. Simple.

But let's see how this interacts with constraints.

Constraint 3: At least one of p1 in t2 or p2 in a1. But t2 is in c2. So getting p1 into t2 would require moving p1 to c2, which complicates things. Alternatively, p2 in a1. But a1 is in l1_1 (c1). So maybe during the process, p2 is loaded into a1. For example, after p2 is in l1_1 (from being unloaded from a2), load it into a1. But why? Because then we can satisfy constraint 3. Let's see.

Alternatively, maybe when p2 is in a1, that's one way. But a1 is in l1_1. So if we load p2 into a1 at l1_1, then that would satisfy the third constraint.

But let's outline steps.

For p1:

- loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
- drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1
- unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (done)

But need to make sure that during this, we handle the constraints.

Now, let's combine the steps for both packages.

But let's check the constraints again.

Constraints:

3. At least one of p1 in t2 or p2 in a1. Since t2 is in c2, getting p1 into t2 would require transporting p1 to c2, which is possible but complicates the plan. Alternatively, get p2 into a1. Since a1 is in l1_1 (c1), and p2 is arriving at l1_1 via a2. So after unloading p2 at l1_1, we could load it into a1. Then, perhaps fly a1 somewhere, but not necessary. Just loading it into a1 would satisfy the constraint.

So step 8: unload p2 from a2 into l1_1. Then step 9: loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (since a1 is there). Then unload again? But that might add unnecessary steps. However, this would satisfy constraint 3 because p2 is in a1. So that's one way.

But then, after that, we need to move p2 to l1_7. So perhaps unload p2 from a1 into l1_1 again, then use truck t1 (if it's in l1_3) to pick up p2 and take it to l1_7. But that's adding steps. Alternatively, after loading p2 into a1, fly a1 to l1_7's airport? Wait, l1_7 is a regular location, not an airport. Airplanes can only land at airports. The airports are l1_1 and l2_1. So airplanes can't go to l1_7. So to get p2 to l1_7, we need to use a truck.

So steps after p2 is in l1_1:

9. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (but t1 is at l1_3 after delivering p1. Wait, no. Let's think.

Wait, for p1's steps:

- loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
- drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1 (t1 is now in l1_3)
- unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (p1 is done)

So t1 is in l1_3. To get p2 from l1_1 to l1_7, we need to use t1 again. So drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1 (if possible). But l1_3 and l1_1 are both in c1. The cities have locations l1_1 to l1_8. So driving from l1_3 to l1_1 via truck is allowed.

So steps:

After p1 is delivered:

10. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
11. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
12. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_7 c1
13. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_7 (satisfies constraint 2)
14. Then drive t1 to l1_5 to drop off p2:
    drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_5 c1
15. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 (goal achieved)

But wait, after step 13, p2 is in l1_7. Then steps 14-15 move it to l1_5. That's okay.

Now, let's check all constraints:

1. p2 in l2_4: achieved in step 2 (unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4)
2. p2 in l1_7: step 13
3. p2 in a1: after step 8 (p2 in l1_1), we can load into a1. Let's add that.

Wait, between step 8 and 9 (assuming steps for p2 after flying):

After step 8: p2 is in l1_1. Then, load into a1:

8. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
9. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (now p2 is in a1, satisfying constraint 3)
Then, to get p2 to l1_7, we need to unload from a1, but a1 is at l1_1. So unload p2 from a1 to l1_1 again. Then use truck t1 to take it to l1_7. But this adds steps. Alternatively, after loading into a1, fly a1 to l2_1? Not helpful. Alternatively, just load and unload to get the condition.

But maybe after step 8 (p2 in l1_1), we can load it into a1 (step 9), then immediately unload (step 10), which would put p2 back in l1_1, but then we have the condition that p2 was in a1 at step 9. That satisfies constraint 3. So steps:

8. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
9. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (satisfies constraint 3)
10. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
Then proceed to move p2 via truck.

This way, constraint 3 is satisfied.

Now, constraint 5: if p2 is in l1_1 (which happens in step 8, 10, etc.), then in that state or later, either p2 is in l1_7 or p1 is in l1_1. Since p1 is in l1_3, we need p2 to reach l1_7 eventually, which it does in step 13. So that's okay.

Constraint 6: p2 must be in a2. That's achieved when p2 is loaded into a2 in step 6 (loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1), and remains in a2 until step 7 (fly to l1_1) and step 8 (unload). So step 6 is when p2 is in a2.

Constraint 7: when p2 is in a2 (step 6), then either p1 is in a2 or p1 is in l2_5 must hold in that state or later. But p1 is in c1 (l1_4 initially, then moved to l1_3). So how to satisfy this?

We need either p1 in a2 (which is in c2's airport l2_1 at that time) or p1 in l2_5 (c2's location). But p1 is in c1. So this seems impossible unless we move p1 to c2. But that complicates the plan. Wait, this is a problem. How to handle constraint 7.

Constraint 7 says: if p2 is in a2 at some state s, then after s, either p1 is in a2 or p1 is in l2_5.

But in our current plan, p2 is loaded into a2 in step 6 (l2_1 in c2). So after that step, we need to ensure that either p1 is in a2 or in l2_5 at some later state.

But p1 is in c1. To get p1 into a2, we would have to transport it from c1 to c2. For example, load p1 into a1 in l1_1, fly to l2_1, unload, load into a2. But that's adding many steps. Alternatively, have p1 in l2_5. But l2_5 is in c2. So how can p1 get there?

This is a major hurdle. Let's think.

Option 1: After p2 is loaded into a2 (step 6), fly a2 to l1_1 (step 7), unload p2 (step 8). Then, somehow get p1 into a2. But a2 is now in l1_1 (c1). So we can load p1 into a2 in l1_1. Then, perhaps fly a2 back to l2_1, but that's extra steps. But this would satisfy the constraint because after step 6 (s), in a later state, p1 is in a2.

But how to do that without affecting the goal. The goal requires p1 to be in l1_3, so we need to make sure that after loading p1 into a2, we unload it back into l1_3 or something. Wait, this complicates the plan.

Alternative approach: After step 6 (p2 in a2), fly a2 to l1_1 (step 7), unload p2 (step 8). Then load p1 into a2 at l1_1 (step 9), then fly a2 to l2_5's airport? Wait, airports are only l1_1 and l2_1. So l2_5 is a regular location in c2, not an airport. So airplanes can't land there. So the only way to get p1 to l2_5 is via truck in c2. But trucks in c2 are t2. But p1 is in c1. So this seems impossible unless we use an airplane to transport p1 to c2's airport l2_1, then use truck t2 to move it to l2_5.

But that's a lot of steps. Let's see:

To satisfy constraint 7:

After step 6 (p2 is in a2), we need to have either p1 in a2 or p1 in l2_5 at some point after.

Option: Load p1 into a1, fly to l2_1, unload into t2, drive to l2_5, unload. Then p1 is in l2_5. But then we have to get it back to l1_3, which is the goal. So this would require:

But p1's initial location is l1_4. To get it to l1_3, we can do that first, then move it to a1, fly to c2, then to l2_5. But this adds many steps, making the plan longer. But the problem requires an optimal plan (shortest possible). So this approach may not be optimal.

Alternative idea: After p2 is in a2 (step 6), fly a2 to l1_1 (step7), unload p2 (step8). Then load p1 into a2 (step9), fly a2 to l2_1 (step10), unload p1 (step11). Now p1 is in l2_1 (c2). Then drive t2 (which is in l2_1 after step5) to l2_5, load p1, drive to l2_5, unload. Now p1 is in l2_5. But then we need to get p1 back to c1 to l1_3. Which requires loading into a2 again, flying to l1_1, then truck to l1_3. This is getting very complicated and makes the plan much longer.

But the problem says the plan must be optimal. So this approach is not optimal.

Alternative approach: Find a way to satisfy constraint 7 without moving p1 to c2. Is that possible?

Constraint 7: If p2 is in a2 in state s, then at s or later, p1 is in a2 or in l2_5.

So during the time when p2 is in a2 (from step6 to step8), we need to have either p1 in a2 or in l2_5 at some point after step6.

But in our current plan, after step6, p1 is still in l1_4 (not yet moved). So how can we get p1 into a2 after step6?

Wait, perhaps after step6 (p2 loaded into a2), fly a2 to l1_1 (step7), unload p2 (step8), then load p1 into a2 (step9), then fly a2 somewhere else. But why would we do that? Because after loading p1 into a2, we can satisfy the constraint. Then, unload p1 back into l1_1, and then move it to l1_3. But this adds steps:

Steps for p1:

Original plan:

1. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1
3. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3

But if we need to load p1 into a2 after step8 (when a2 is in l1_1):

After step8 (p2 unloaded at l1_1), load p1 into a2 (which is in l1_1):

But p1 is in l1_3. So we need to move p1 from l1_3 to l1_1 using t1:

4. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
5. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (but p1 is in l1_3, not in t1 anymore. Wait, no: after step3, p1 is in l1_3, and t1 is in l1_3. To load p1 into a2, which is in l1_1, we need to drive t1 to l1_1 with p1.

Wait, no. After step3, p1 is unloaded from t1 into l1_3. So p1 is in l1_3, and t1 is in l1_3. So to move p1 to l1_1, we need to load it into t1 again:

4. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
5. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
6. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (now p1 is in l1_1)
7. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (a2 is there after step7)
8. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1 (not necessary, but just to have p1 in a2)
9. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (now p1 is in l2_1)
10. Then, to get p1 back to l1_3, need to load into a2 again, fly to l1_1, then truck. This is getting too long.

Alternatively, after loading p1 into a2 in l1_1 (step7 above), we can immediately unload it, which would put p1 back in l1_1, and then drive to l1_3. But that adds steps.

This approach is making the plan longer, which contradicts the optimality requirement.

Hmm. Is there another way to satisfy constraint 7 without moving p1?

Wait, what if after loading p2 into a2 (step6), we immediately load p1 into a2 as well? But p1 is in l1_4, which is in c1. a2 is in l2_1 (c2) at step6. So to load p1 into a2, we need to have p1 in l2_1, which is impossible unless we move it there. Which brings us back to the previous problem.

Alternatively, is there a way to have p1 in a2 while a2 is in c1? For example, after flying a2 to l1_1 (step7), then load p1 into a2 there. So after step7, a2 is in l1_1. Then load p1 into a2 (requires p1 to be in l1_1). So steps:

After delivering p1 to l1_3, drive t1 back to l1_1:

4. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
5. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (but p1 is in l1_3, not in t1. So this isn't possible unless we first load p1 into t1 again.

Wait, p1 is in l1_3. To get it to l1_1:

6. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (assuming t1 is in l1_3)
7. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
8. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (now p1 is in l1_1)
9. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (a2 is there after step7)
Now p1 is in a2. This satisfies constraint 7 because after step6 (p2 in a2), in step9, p1 is in a2. So the constraint is satisfied.

Then, we can unload p1 from a2 back to l1_1:

10. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
11. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
12. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
13. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (but p1 was already there, so this is redundant. But necessary to get it back to the goal.)

But this adds a lot of steps. However, this might be necessary to satisfy constraint7.

Let's outline the full plan with these steps:

For p2:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
2. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (constraint1 met)
3. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
4. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
5. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
6. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (constraint6 met)
7. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
8. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (constraint4 met)
9. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (constraint3 met)
10. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
11. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (assuming t1 is now in l1_1)
12. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_7 c1
13. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_7 (constraint2 met)
14. drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_5 c1
15. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 (goal met)

For p1:

a. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
b. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1
c. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (goal met)
d. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (to move it back)
e. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
f. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
g. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (now p1 is in a2, satisfying constraint7 after step6)
h. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
i. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
j. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
k. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3

But this is very long. However, the problem requires an optimal plan. So perhaps there's a shorter way.

Wait, maybe we can combine some steps. Let's see:

After step6 (p2 loaded into a2), we need to get p1 into a2 or l2_5. The easiest way is to have p1 in a2 after step6. But how?

Alternatively, after step7 (a2 flies to l1_1), we load p1 into a2 there. So steps:

For p1:

- After stepc (p1 in l1_3), drive t1 to l1_1 (stepd: drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1)
- Load p1 into a2 (step e: loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1). This requires a2 to be in l1_1, which it is after step7.
- Now p1 is in a2. Then, we can unload it back into l1_1 (stepf: unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1)
- Then load into t1 (stepg: loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1)
- Drive back to l1_3 (steph: drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1)
- Unload (stepi: unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3)

This adds steps d, e, f, g, h, i. But these steps are necessary to satisfy constraint7.

So the full plan would be:

```
drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_7 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_7
drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_5 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
```

Wait, but this plan has many steps. Let's count:

Steps 1-7: Moving p2 to l1_1.

Steps 8-11: Moving p1 to l1_3.

Steps 12-16: Moving p1 to l1_1, loading into a2, then back to l1_3.

Steps 17-22: Moving p2 to l1_7 and then to l1_5.

This seems too long. But maybe there's a smarter way.

Alternative approach: After p2 is in a2 (step6), fly a2 to l1_1 (step7). Then, before unloading p2, load p1 into a2. But p1 is in l1_4. So how?

Alternatively, after step7, a2 is in l1_1. To get p1 into a2, p1 must be in l1_1. So drive t1 to l1_1 with p1:

But p1 is initially in l1_4. So:

After delivering p1 to l1_3 (steps a-c), drive t1 back to l1_4 to pick up p1 again? No, p1 is in l1_3. So steps:

After step c (p1 in l1_3), load p1 into t1 (which is in l1_3), drive to l1_1, unload, load into a2.

So:

d. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
e. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
f. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
g. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (now p1 is in a2)
h. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (now p1 is back in l1_1)
i. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
j. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
k. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3

This way, after step g, p1 is in a2, satisfying constraint7 (since after step6, p2 was in a2, and then in stepg, p1 is in a2, which is after step6). So this meets the requirement.

But this adds steps d-k. However, this allows the plan to proceed.

So integrating all steps:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2 (move t2 to l2_4)
2. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (p2 in l2_4, constraint1)
3. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (p2 loaded back)
4. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2 (to airport)
5. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (p2 in l2_1)
6. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (constraint6)
7. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (fly to c1's airport)
8. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (constraint4)
9. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (constraint3)
10. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (p2 back in l1_1)
11. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4 (start moving p1)
12. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1
13. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (p1 goal met)
14. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (to move it to l1_1)
15. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
16. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (p1 in l1_1)
17. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (now p1 in a2, satisfying constraint7)
18. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
19. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (prepare to move back)
20. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
21. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (p1 back in goal)
22. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (p2 is in l1_1 from step10)
23. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_7 c1
24. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_7 (constraint2)
25. drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_5 c1
26. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 (p2 goal met)

But this is a very long plan. Is there a way to optimize?

Let me think again. The key constraints are:

- p2 must be in a2 (step6)
- After that, p1 must be in a2 or l2_5. The simplest is to load p1 into a2 after it arrives in l1_1.

But after step7, a2 is in l1_1. So if we can load p1 into a2 there, then unload it back, that satisfies the constraint.

But how to get p1 to l1_1 after it's been delivered to l1_3.

Alternative idea: Maybe while moving p1 to l1_3, we take a detour through l1_1. But that's not optimal.

Alternatively, after moving p1 to l1_3, move it to l1_1 via truck, load into a2, then move back.

But this adds steps.

Alternatively, maybe we can combine moving p1 to l1_3 with the steps to satisfy constraint7.

But I'm not sure. Given the time constraints, perhaps this is the best possible plan, even though it's long. However, I need to check if all constraints are met:

- Constraint1: p2 in l2_4 (step2)
- Constraint2: p2 in l1_7 (step24)
- Constraint3: p2 in a1 (step9)
- Constraint4: p2 in l1_1 (step8 and step10)
- Constraint5: after p2 in l1_1 (step8), later p2 is in l1_7 (step24), which satisfies the requirement.
- Constraint6: p2 in a2 (step6)
- Constraint7: after step6, p1 is loaded into a2 (step17), which happens after step6.

Yes, all constraints are satisfied.

But the plan is quite long. Is there a shorter way?

Alternative approach: Perhaps after step6 (p2 in a2), fly a2 to l1_1 (step7), then unload p2 (step8). Then load p1 into a2 (step9), then fly a2 back to l2_1 (step10), unload p1 (step11). Now p1 is in l2_1. Then drive t2 (which is in l2_1 after step4) to l2_5, load p1, unload there (step12). This puts p1 in l2_5, satisfying constraint7. But then we need to get p1 back to l1_3. So load into a2 again, fly to l1_1, then truck to l1_3. This adds steps but might be shorter.

Let's try:

Steps for p2:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
2. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (constraint1)
3. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
4. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
5. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
6. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (constraint6)
7. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
8. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (constraint4)
9. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (constraint3)
10. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
11. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
12. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_7 c1
13. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_7 (constraint2)
14. drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_5 c1
15. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 (goal)

For p1:

a. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
b. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1
c. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (goal)
d. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
e. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
f. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
g. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (now p1 in a2)
h. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
i. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
j. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
k. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
l. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (constraint7)
m. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
n. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
o. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
p. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
q. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
r. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
s. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
t. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3

This is even longer. Not optimal.

Alternative idea: Maybe the initial assumption about the typo was incorrect. Maybe t1 and t2 are packages, and trucks are something else. But the problem states trucks t1 and t2 are part of the world. So the initial state must have errors. Given that, perhaps the correct initial positions are:

Packages p1 and p2 are in their locations, trucks t1 and t2 are in l1_4 and l2_3, airplanes a1 and a2 are in l1_1 and l2_1.

Thus, the correct initial state is:

- Truck t1 is at l1_4.
- Truck t2 is at l2_3.
- Airplane a1 is at l1_1.
- Airplane a2 is at l2_1.
- Package p1 is at l1_4.
- Package p2 is at l2_3.

This makes sense. So the original state's "Package t1 is in location l1_4" is a mistake, and should be "Truck t1 is in location l1_4".

Assuming that, then the initial state is correct.

Given that, the plan can proceed as follows:

For p1:

1. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1
3. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (done)

For p2:

4. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
5. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (constraint1)
6. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
7. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
8. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
9. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (constraint6)
10. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
11. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (constraint4)
12. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (constraint3)
13. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
14. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (assuming t1 is now in l1_3, but t1 was used for p1 and is now in l1_3. So need to drive t1 to l1_1)

Wait, t1 is in l1_3 after step3. To move p2 from l1_1 to l1_7, we need to use t1. So steps:

14. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
15. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
16. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_7 c1
17. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_7 (constraint2)
18. drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_5 c1
19. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 (goal)

But also, need to satisfy constraint7. When p2 is in a2 (step9), then after that, p1 must be in a2 or l2_5.

So after step9 (p2 in a2), we need to get p1 into a2 or l2_5.

But p1 is in l1_3. So how?

Perhaps after step3, move p1 to l1_1:

4. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1 (t1 is in l1_3 after step3)
5. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (a2 is in l1_1 after step10)
But steps need to be ordered correctly.

Wait, the steps for p2 must happen after p1's steps? Or can they be interleaved?

Let's reorder:

1. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1
3. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (p1 done)
4. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2 (p2 to l2_4)
5. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (constraint1)
6. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
7. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
8. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
9. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (constraint6)
10. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
11. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (constraint4)
12. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (constraint3)
13. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
14. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1 (move t1 to l1_1)
15. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
16. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_7 c1
17. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_7 (constraint2)
18. drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_5 c1
19. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 (goal)
20. Now, to satisfy constraint7: after step9 (p2 in a2), need p1 in a2 or l2_5. So after step9, fly a2 to l1_1, then load p1 into a2.

But p1 is in l1_3. So need to move p1 to l1_1:

21. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (but t1 is in l1_3 after step3)
22. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1 (t1 is now in l1_1)
23. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (p1 in l1_1)
24. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (now p1 is in a2, satisfying constraint7 after step9)
25. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
26. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
27. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
28. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (p1 back to goal)

But this adds steps 21-28, making the plan even longer.

This seems unavoidable. Given the constraints, especially constraint7, the plan must include steps to get p1 into a2 after p2 is loaded into a2.

The optimal plan would require the fewest possible steps while satisfying all constraints. The best approach seems to be:

- Handle p1 first, then p2, while interleaving steps to meet the constraints.

But I'm running out of time, so I'll present the plan that includes all necessary steps to meet the constraints, even if it's longer.
