Let's break down the problem:

We have two cities, c1 and c2. Each city has several locations, including an airport (l1_1 for c1 and l2_1 for c2). We also have two trucks, t1 and t2, and two airplanes, a1 and a2. Our goal is to transport two packages, p1 and p2, to specific locations.

But there's a mistake in the initial state description:
- It says "Package t1 is in location l1_2", but t1 is a truck, not a package.
- It says "Package t2 is in location l2_1", but t2 is a truck, not a package.
- It says "Package a1 is in location l1_1", but a1 is an airplane, not a package.
- It says "Package a2 is in location l2_1", but a2 is an airplane, not a package.

Let's assume the correct initial state is:
- "Truck t1 is in location l1_2"
- "Truck t2 is in location l2_1"
- "Airplane a1 is in location l1_1"
- "Airplane a2 is in location l2_1"
- "Package p1 is in location l2_5"
- "Package p2 is in location l2_2"

Our goal is to ensure:
- "Package p1 is in location l1_1"
- "Package p2 is in location l1_4"

We also have several constraints that dictate the intermediate states that must be satisfied:

1. "Package p1 is in location l1_2" OR "Package p2 is in location l2_3" must be true in at least one state.
2. "Package p2 is in location l2_1" must be true in at least one state.
3. Before "Package p2 is in location l2_1" holds, "Package p2 is in location l2_3" OR "Package p1 is in location l1_3" must be true.
4. "Package p2 is in location l1_4" must be true in at least one state (this is already covered by our goal).
5. Before "Package p2 is in location l1_4" holds, "Package p1 is in location l1_3" OR "Package p2 is in location l2_4" must be true.
6. "Package p2 is in location l1_1" must be true in at least one state.
7. Before "Package p2 is in location l1_1" holds, "Package p1 is in location l2_3" must be true.
8. "Package p1 is in location l2_1" must be true in at least one state.
9. After (or at the same time as) "Package p1 is in location l2_1" holds, "Package p2 is in location l2_4" OR "Package p1 is in location l2_2" must be true.

Let's try to come up with a plan that satisfies these constraints.

First, let's start with the initial state:
- "Truck t1 is in location l1_2"
- "Truck t2 is in location l2_1"
- "Airplane a1 is in location l1_1"
- "Airplane a2 is in location l2_1"
- "Package p1 is in location l2_5"
- "Package p2 is in location l2_2"

Given the constraints, we need to transport p1 to l1_1 and p2 to l1_4, while also ensuring all the intermediate states are satisfied. 

Let's think step by step. Since we need p1 to be in l2_3 at some point (due to constraint 7, which says before p2 is in l1_1, p1 must be in l2_3), and we need p1 to end up in l1_1, let's first transport p1 from l2_5 to l2_3, then to l2_1, and finally to l1_1.

Similarly, for p2, we need it to pass through l2_3 (or p1 to be in l1_3, but let's go with the first option), then to l2_1, and eventually to l1_4. Also, due to constraint 6, p2 must be in l1_1 at some point, and before that happens, p1 must be in l2_3 (constraint 7). And for constraint 9, after p1 is in l2_1, we need p2 to be in l2_4 or p1 to be in l2_2, so let's ensure p2 passes through l2_4 as well.

I need to refine this plan further by ensuring the exact sequence that satisfies all constraints. Let's try to piece a valid plan step by step:

For package p1:
- Start in l2_5
- Needs to go to l2_3 (constraint 7 before p2 is in l1_1)
- Needs to go to l2_1 (constraint 8)
- After p1 is in l2_1, either p2 is in l2_4 or p1 is in l2_2 (constraint 9)
- Finally, p1 needs to end up in l1_1 (goal)

For package p2:
- Start in l2_2
- Needs to go to l2_3 (or p1 needs to be in l1_3, constraint 3 before p2 is in l2_1)
- Needs to go to l2_1 (constraint 2)
- Needs to go to l2_4 (or p1 needs to be in l1_3, constraint 5 before p2 is in l1_4)
- Needs to pass through l1_1 (constraint 6)
- Finally, p2 needs to end up in l1_4 (goal)

Let's outline a sequence:

1. Move truck t2 to l2_5 to pick up p1.
2. Load p1 onto t2.
3. Drive t2 to l2_3.
4. Unload p1 at l2_3 (satisfies part of constraint 7).
5. Drive t2 to l2_2 to pick up p2.
6. Load p2 onto t2.
7. Drive t2 to l2_3.
8. Unload p2 at l2_3 (satisfies part of constraint 3, where p2 needs to be in l2_3 before it's in l2_1).
9. Load p1 back onto t2 (p1 is in l2_3 from step 4).
10. Drive t2 to l2_1.
11. Unload p1 at l2_1 (satisfies constraint 8).
12. Load p2 onto t2 (p2 is in l2_3 from step 8).
13. Drive t2 to l2_4.
14. Unload p2 at l2_4 (satisfies constraint 9 and part of constraint 5).
15. Now, we need to transport both packages to city c1. Since packages are in city c2, we need to use airplanes to transport them.
16. Drive t2 to l2_1 to load p1 onto an airplane.
17. Load p1 onto airplane a2 (a2 is initially at l2_1).
18. Fly a2 to l1_1.
19. Unload p1 at l1_1 (satisfies goal for p1).
20. Fly a2 back to l2_1.
21. Drive t2 to l2_4 to pick up p2.
22. Load p2 onto t2.
23. Drive t2 to l2_1.
24. Load p2 onto a2.
25. Fly a2 to l1_1.
26. Unload p2 at l1_1 (satisfies constraint 6).
27. Drive truck t1 to l1_1 (t1 starts in l1_2).
28. Load p2 onto t1.
29. Drive t1 to l1_4.
30. Unload p2 at l1_4 (satisfies goal for p2).

Wait, I realized I missed some constraints. Let's review the constraints again.

1. "Package p1 is in location l1_2" OR "Package p2 is in location l2_3" must be true in at least one state.
   - We have p2 in l2_3 (step 8), so this is satisfied.

2. "Package p2 is in location l2_1" must be true in at least one state.
   - This will be true after we transport p2 to the airport (step 23-24).

3. Before "Package p2 is in location l2_1" holds, "Package p2 is in location l2_3" OR "Package p1 is in location l1_3" must be true.
   - We have p2 in l2_3 (step 8), so this is satisfied.

4. "Package p2 is in location l1_4" must be true in at least one state (this is already covered by our goal).
   - This is true in the goal.

5. Before "Package p2 is in location l1_4" holds, "Package p1 is in location l1_3" OR "Package p2 is in location l2_4" must be true.
   - We have p2 in l2_4 (step 14), so this is satisfied.

6. "Package p2 is in location l1_1" must be true in at least one state.
   - This is true in step 26.

7. Before "Package p2 is in location l1_1" holds, "Package p1 is in location l2_3" must be true.
   - We have p1 in l2_3 (step 4), which is before p2 is in l1_1 (step 26), so this is satisfied.

8. "Package p1 is in location l2_1" must be true in at least one state.
   - This is true in step 11.

9. After (or at the same time as) "Package p1 is in location l2_1" holds, "Package p2 is in location l2_4" OR "Package p1 is in location l2_2" must be true.
   - We have p2 in l2_4 (step 14), which comes after p1 is in l2_1 (step 11), so this is satisfied.

Looks like the plan addresses all the constraints. Let's now translate this plan into the exact action format required. I'll expand each step into the required actions.

1. Move truck t2 to l2_5 to pick up p1:
   "drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2"

2. Load p1 onto t2:
   "loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5"

3. Drive t2 to l2_3:
   "drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_3 c2"

4. Unload p1 at l2_3:
   "unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3"

5. Drive t2 to l2_2 to pick up p2:
   "drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2"

6. Load p2 onto t2:
   "loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2"

7. Drive t2 to l2_3:
   "drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2"

8. Unload p2 at l2_3:
   "unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3"

9. Load p1 back onto t2:
   "loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3"

10. Drive t2 to l2_1:
    "drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2"

11. Unload p1 at l2_1:
    "unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1"

12. Drive t2 back to l2_3 to pick up p2:
    "drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2"

13. Load p2 onto t2:
    "loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3"

14. Drive t2 to l2_4:
    "drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2"

15. Unload p2 at l2_4:
    "unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4"

16. Drive t2 to l2_1 to facilitate airplane operations:
    "drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2"

17. Load p1 onto airplane a2:
    "loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1"

18. Fly a2 to l1_1:
    "flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1"

19. Unload p1 at l1_1:
    "unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1"

20. Fly a2 back to l2_1:
    "flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1"

21. Drive t2 to l2_4 to pick up p2:
    "drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2"

22. Load p2 onto t2:
    "loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4"

23. Drive t2 to l2_1:
    "drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2"

24. Load p2 onto a2:
    "loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1"

25. Fly a2 to l1_1:
    "flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1"

26. Unload p2 at l1_1:
    "unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1"

27. Drive truck t1 to l1_1:
    "drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1"

28. Load p2 onto t1:
    "loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1"

29. Drive t1 to l1_4:
    "drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1"

30. Unload p2 at l1_4:
    "unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4"

Let me double-check this plan:

1. We pick up p1 from its initial location l2_5.
2. We move p1 to l2_3 (satisfying constraint 7).
3. We pick up p2 from its initial location l2_2.
4. We move p2 to l2_3 (satisfying constraint 1 and part of constraint 3).
5. We move p1 to l2_1 (satisfying constraint 8).
6. We move p2 to l2_4 (satisfying part of constraint 5 and constraint 9).
7. We fly p1 to l1_1 (satisfying the goal for p1).
8. We transport p2 to l1_1 using the airplane (satisfying constraint 6).
9. We finally transport p2 to l1_4 (satisfying the goal for p2).

All constraints are satisfied, and both packages reach their goal locations.

However, I realized I made a mistake in the actions. There's no "unloadairplane" action; it should be "loadairplane", but that doesn't make sense. Let me recheck the action descriptions.

Ah, there seems to be a typo in the action descriptions. The fourth action should be "unloadairplane" but is mistakenly written as "loadairplane" again. Let's correct that:

The actions of this domain are:
1. "loadtruck p t l": Load package p in truck t. Both p and t are in location l.
2. "loadairplane p ap l": Load package p in airplane ap. Both p and ap are in location l.
3. "unloadtruck p t l": Unload package p from truck t in location l.
4. "unloadairplane p ap l": Unload package p from airplane ap in location l. (Corrected from the input)
5. "drivetruck t l_from l_to c": Drive truck t from location l_from to location l_to in city c.
6. "flyairplane ap l_from l_to": Fly airplane ap from location l_from to location l_to.

With this correction, the plan remains the same. Let me quickly review the steps to confirm validity.

Ok, my plan is mostly correct, but I think there's an issue with the initial state. Let's correct that:

Initial state:
- "Truck t1 is in location l1_2"
- "Truck t2 is in location l2_1"
- "Airplane a1 is in location l1_1"
- "Airplane a2 is in location l2_1"
- "Package p1 is in location l2_5"
- "Package p2 is in location l2_2"

The plan I've outlined above should work with this corrected initial state. Let's summarize it once more:

1. Move truck t2 from its initial location l2_1 to l2_5.
2. Load package p1 onto truck t2.
3. Drive truck t2 from l2_5 to l2_3.
4. Unload package p1 from truck t2 at l2_3. (This satisfies constraint 7, p1 in l2_3 before p2 in l1_1)
5. Drive truck t2 from l2_3 to l2_2.
6. Load package p2 onto truck t2.
7. Drive truck t2 from l2_2 to l2_3.
8. Unload package p2 from truck t2 at l2_3. (This satisfies constraint 1, p2 in l2_3, and part of constraint 3, p2 in l2_3 before p2 in l2_1)
9. Load package p1 back onto truck t2.
10. Drive truck t2 from l2_3 to l2_1.
11. Unload package p1 from truck t2 at l2_1. (This satisfies constraint 8, p1 in l2_1)
12. Drive truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_3.
13. Load package p2 onto truck t2.
14. Drive truck t2 from l2_3 to l2_4.
15. Unload package p2 from truck t2 at l2_4. (This satisfies constraint 9, p2 in l2_4 after p1 in l2_1, and part of constraint 5, p2 in l2_4 before p2 in l1_4)
16. Drive truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
17. Load package p1 onto airplane a2.
18. Fly airplane a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
19. Unload package p1 from airplane a2 at l1_1. (This satisfies part of the goal, p1 in l1_1)
20. Fly airplane a2 from l1_1 to l2_1.
21. Drive truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_4.
22. Load package p2 onto truck t2.
23. Drive truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
24. Load package p2 onto airplane a2.
25. Fly airplane a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
26. Unload package p2 from airplane a2 at l1_1. (This satisfies constraint 6, p2 in l1_1)
27. Drive truck t1 from l1_2 to l1_1.
28. Load package p2 onto truck t1.
29. Drive truck t1 from l1_1 to l1_4.
30. Unload package p2 from truck t1 at l1_4. (This satisfies the remainder of the goal, p2 in l1_4, and constraint 4, p2 in l1_4)

All constraints are satisfied, and both packages reach their goal locations.

Let me now write out the complete sequence of actions:

```
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_3 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
```

This plan should satisfy all the given constraints while achieving the goal of transporting p1 to l1_1 and p2 to l1_4.

Let me verify that constraint 2, "Package p2 is in location l2_1" must be true in at least one state, is satisfied.

In my plan, after steps 23-24, p2 is loaded onto a2 at l2_1. For a brief moment, before it's loaded onto a2, p2 must be in location l2_1, since it's a precondition for loading it onto the airplane. So constraint 2 is indeed satisfied.

And for constraint 3, "Before 'Package p2 is in location l2_1' holds, 'Package p2 is in location l2_3' OR 'Package p1 is in location l1_3' must be true."

In my plan, p2 is in l2_3 (after step 8) before p2 is in l2_1 (step 23-24), so constraint 3 is satisfied.

All other constraints are also checked and satisfied. This plan should be valid.

Actually let me think through this one more time to make sure everything is valid with the problem statement:

We have a logistics problem with two cities, c1 and c2. Each city has multiple locations, with l1_1 and l2_1 being airports. We also have two trucks, t1 and t2, and two airplanes, a1 and a2. Our goal is to transport two packages, p1 and p2, to specific locations.

The initial state is:
- "Location l1_1 is in city c1"
- "Location l1_2 is in city c1"
- "Location l1_3 is in city c1"
- "Location l1_4 is in city c1"
- "Location l1_5 is in city c1"
- "Location l2_1 is in city c2"
- "Location l2_2 is in city c2"
- "Location l2_3 is in city c2"
- "Location l2_4 is in city c2"
- "Location l2_5 is in city c2"
- "Package t1 is in location l1_2"
- "Package t2 is in location l2_1"
- "Package p1 is in location l2_5"
- "Package p2 is in location l2_2"
- "Package a1 is in location l1_1"
- "Package a2 is in location l2_1"

This seems very odd. The problem statement says t1 and t2 are trucks, and a1 and a2 are airplanes, but in the initial state, they're described as packages. Let me reconsider.

I think there's a typo in the problem statement, and what is intended is:
- "Truck t1 is in location l1_2"
- "Truck t2 is in location l2_1"
- "Airplane a1 is in location l1_1"
- "Airplane a2 is in location l2_1"
- "Package p1 is in location l2_5"
- "Package p2 is in location l2_2"

The goal is to ensure:
- "Package p1 is in location l1_1"
- "Package p2 is in location l1_4"

With this correction, the plan I've outlined above should be valid. However, given the issue in the problem statement, it's important to double-check with the original source if possible.

Final plan summary:
1. Move truck t2 from its initial location l2_1 to l2_5.
2. Load package p1 onto truck t2.
3. Drive truck t2 from l2_5 to l2_3.
4. Unload package p1 from truck t2 at l2_3. (This satisfies constraint 7, p1 in l2_3 before p2 in l1_1)
5. Drive truck t2 from l2_3 to l2_2.
6. Load package p2 onto truck t2.
7. Drive truck t2 from l2_2 to l2_3.
8. Unload package p2 from truck t2 at l2_3. (This satisfies constraint 1, p2 in l2_3, and part of constraint 3, p2 in l2_3 before p2 in l2_1)
9. Load package p1 back onto truck t2.
10. Drive truck t2 from l2_3 to l2_1.
11. Unload package p1 from truck t2 at l2_1. (This satisfies constraint 8, p1 in l2_1)
12. Drive truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_3.
13. Load package p2 onto truck t2.
14. Drive truck t2 from l2_3 to l2_4.
15. Unload package p2 from truck t2 at l2_4. (This satisfies constraint 9, p2 in l2_4 after p1 in l2_1, and part of constraint 5, p2 in l2_4 before p2 in l1_4)
16. Drive truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
17. Load package p1 onto airplane a2.
18. Fly airplane a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
19. Unload package p1 from airplane a2 at l1_1. (This satisfies part of the goal, p1 in l1_1)
20. Fly airplane a2 from l1_1 to l2_1.
21. Drive truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_4.
22. Load package p2 onto truck t2.
23. Drive truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
24. Load package p2 onto airplane a2.
25. Fly airplane a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
26. Unload package p2 from airplane a2 at l1_1. (This satisfies constraint 6, p2 in l1_1)
27. Drive truck t1 from l1_2 to l1_1.
28. Load package p2 onto truck t1.
29. Drive truck t1 from l1_1 to l1_4.
30. Unload package p2 from truck t1 at l1_4. (This satisfies the remainder of the goal, p2 in l1_4, and constraint 4, p2 in l1_4)

All constraints are satisfied, and both packages reach their goal locations.

Now, let's write out the complete sequence of actions:

```
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_3 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
```

Hang on, there seems to be an issue in the initial state. It claims that "Package t1 is in location l1_2" and "Package t2 is in location l2_1", but t1 and t2 are trucks, not packages. Similarly, a1 and a2 are described as packages, but they are airplanes.

Let's reconsider:

Initial state:
- "Location l1_1 is in city c1"
- "Location l1_2 is in city c1"
- "Location l1_3 is in city c1"
- "Location l1_4 is in city c1"
- "Location l1_5 is in city c1"
- "Location l2_1 is in city c2"
- "Location l2_2 is in city c2"
- "Location l2_3 is in city c2"
- "Location l2_4 is in city c2"
- "Location l2_5 is in city c2"
- "Package t1 is in location l1_2"
- "Package t2 is in location l2_1"
- "Package p1 is in location l2_5"
- "Package p2 is in location l2_2"
- "Package a1 is in location l1_1"
- "Package a2 is in location l2_1"

We're asked to bring about the situation:
- "Package p1 is in location l1_1"
- "Package p2 is in location l1_4"

But there's no mention of where the trucks and airplanes are in the initial state. Given the context, it's most likely a typo, and what is intended is:
- "Truck t1 is in location l1_2"
- "Truck t2 is in location l2_1"
- "Airplane a1 is in location l1_1"
- "Airplane a2 is in location l2_1"
- "Package p1 is in location l2_5"
- "Package p2 is in location l2_2"

With this correction, the plan I've outlined above should be valid. However, to be certain, it would be good to double-check with the original source if possible.

For now, I'll go with the corrected initial state:
- "Truck t1 is in location l1_2"
- "Truck t2 is in location l2_1"
- "Airplane a1 is in location l1_1"
- "Airplane a2 is in location l2_1"
- "Package p1 is in location l2_5"
- "Package p2 is in location l2_2"

And the plan remains as I've outlined:

```
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_3 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
```

That should be a valid plan with the corrected initial state. 

Actually, for the sake of argument, let's assume the initial state is as stated, with "Package t1", "Package t2", etc. In that case, t1 and t2 are packages, not trucks, and a1 and a2 are packages, not airplanes. We would need to introduce other entities to serve the role of trucks and airplanes.

But that doesn't make sense with the problem statement, which explicitly states:
"The world may also include trucks, airplanes and packages. Trucks may move between locations in a city, while airplanes may move between airports. Trucks and airplanes may carry packages."

So, t1 and t2, as listed in the initial state, must be trucks, not packages. Similarly, a1 and a2 must be airplanes, not packages.

The most sensible interpretation is that there's a typo in the initial state, and the corrected version is what I've been working with. That is:
- "Truck t1 is in location l1_2"
- "Truck t2 is in location l2_1"
- "Airplane a1 is in location l1_1"
- "Airplane a2 is in location l2_1"
- "Package p1 is in location l2_5"
- "Package p2 is in location l2_2"

Thus, the plan I've outlined above is valid.

Let me run through the plan one last time to ensure it satisfies all constraints:

1. Transport p1 from l2_5 to l2_3 (addressing constraint 7, p1 in l2_3 before p2 in l1_1)
2. Transport p2 from l2_2 to l2_3 (addressing constraint 1, p2 in l2_3, and part of constraint 3, p2 in l2_3 before p2 in l2_1)
3. Transport p1 from l2_3 to l2_1 (addressing constraint 8, p1 in l2_1)
4. Transport p2 from l2_3 to l2_4 (addressing constraint 9, p2 in l2_4 after p1 in l2_1, and part of constraint 5, p2 in l2_4 before p2 in l1_4)
5. Transport p1 from l2_1 to l1_1 (addressing part of the goal, p1 in l1_1)
6. Transport p2 from l2_4 to l1_1 via l2_1 (addressing constraint 6, p2 in l1_1, and constraint 2, p2 in l2_1)
7. Transport p2 from l1_1 to l1_4 (addressing the remainder of the goal, p2 in l1_4, and constraint 4, p2 in l1_4)

All constraints are satisfied, and both packages reach their goal locations. The plan consists of 30 steps, which I believe is optimal for the given constraints.

Actually, let me be careful about constraint 9: After p1 is in l2_1, either p2 should be in l2_4 or p1 should be in l2_2.

In our plan, p1 is in l2_1 after step 11, and p2 is in l2_4 after step 15. So, at that point, p1 is no longer in l2_1 (it's being transported to l1_1). This seems to contradict constraint 9. 

Let me revisit the exact wording of constraint 9: "If expression 'Package p1 is in location l2_1' holds in some state s, then expression 'At least one of the following conditions is true: Package p2 is in location l2_4, Package p1 is in location l2_2' must hold at s or at some state after s."

So, after p1 is in l2_1 (step 11), either p2 should be in l2_4 or p1 should be in l2_2. In our plan, p2 is in l2_4 after step 15, which is indeed after step 11. So constraint 9 is satisfied.

Let's double-check all the constraints once more:

1. "Package p1 is in location l1_2" OR "Package p2 is in location l2_3" must be true in at least one state.
   - In our plan, p2 is in l2_3 after step 8, so this is satisfied.

2. "Package p2 is in location l2_1" must be true in at least one state.
   - In our plan, p2 is in l2_1 after step 23 (before it's loaded onto airplane a2), so this is satisfied.

3. Before "Package p2 is in location l2_1" holds, "Package p2 is in location l2_3" OR "Package p1 is in location l1_3" must be true.
   - In our plan, p2 is in l2_3 after step 8, which is before p2 is in l2_1 (step 23), so this is satisfied.

4. "Package p2 is in location l1_4" must be true in at least one state (this is already covered by our goal).
   - In our plan, p2 is in l1_4 after step 30 (the final step), so this is satisfied.

5. Before "Package p2 is in location l1_4" holds, "Package p1 is in location l1_3" OR "Package p2 is in location l2_4" must be true.
   - In our plan, p2 is in l2_4 after step 15, which is before p2 is in l1_4 (step 30), so this is satisfied.

6. "Package p2 is in location l1_1" must be true in at least one state.
   - In our plan, p2 is in l1_1 after step 26, so this is satisfied.

7. Before "Package p2 is in location l1_1" holds, "Package p1 is in location l2_3" must be true.
   - In our plan, p1 is in l2_3 after step 4, which is before p2 is in l1_1 (step 26), so this is satisfied.

8. "Package p1 is in location l2_1" must be true in at least one state.
   - In our plan, p1 is in l2_1 after step 11, so this is satisfied.

9. After (or at the same time as) "Package p1 is in location l2_1" holds, "Package p2 is in location l2_4" OR "Package p1 is in location l2_2" must be true.
   - In our plan, p1 is in l2_1 after step 11, and later, p2 is in l2_4 after step 15, so this is satisfied.

All constraints are satisfied, and our plan is valid.

Here's the complete sequence of actions:
