Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. First, I need to understand the initial state and the goal. The goal is to have p1 in l1_5 and p2 in l1_4. Let's look at where everything starts.

Initial state:
- p1 is in l2_5 (city c2)
- p2 is in l2_3 (city c2)
- Trucks t1 is in l1_4 (city c1), t2 in l2_3 (city c2)
- Airplanes a1 is in l1_1 (c1's airport), a2 in l2_1 (c2's airport)

So both packages start in city c2. To get them to c1, we probably need airplanes. Let's see the constraints.

Constraints:
1. p2 must be in l1_1 at some state. And when that happens, there must be an earlier state where p1 is in l1_4 or p2 in l1_2.
2. p2 must be in l2_1 at some state. If that's true, then p1 must be in l1_4 at or after that state.
3. p2 must end up in l1_4, but that's part of the goal. Also, when p2 is in l1_4, there must be an earlier state where p1 was in l1_4.
4. p1 must be in a1 at some state, and p2 must be in a1 at some state.

Hmm, so for constraint 4 and 5, both packages need to be loaded into a1 at some point. But a1 is in c1's airport (l1_1). So to get the packages into a1, they need to be transported to l1_1 first.

Let me outline the steps for each package.

For p1: starts in l2_5 (c2). To get to l1_5 (c1). So probably need to move p1 from l2_5 to l2_1 (airport) via truck t2, load into airplane a2 (which is at l2_1?), wait, a2 is at l2_1. Wait, no: initial state says "Package a1 is in location l1_1" and "Package a2 is in location l2_1". Wait, maybe that's a typo. Wait, the original state says:

Wait, the original state lists "Package t1 is in location l1_4", "Package t2 is in location l2_3", "Package p1 is in location l2_5", "Package p2 is in location l2_3", "Package a1 is in location l1_1", "Package a2 is in location l2_1". Wait, but a1 and a2 are airplanes, right? So the airplane a1 is at l1_1 (airport in c1), a2 at l2_1 (airport in c2). So to fly packages between cities, we need to use airplanes.

So for p1: in l2_5 (c2). Need to get to l1_5 (c1). So steps:

1. Use truck t2 (in l2_3) to drive to l2_5. Wait, can t2 move within c2. Yes. So drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_5. Then load p1 into t2. Then drive t2 to l2_1 (airport in c2). Then unload p1, load into a2. Then fly a2 to l1_1 (c1's airport). Then unload p1 from a2 into l1_1. Then use truck t1 (in l1_4) to drive to l1_1? Wait, t1 is in l1_4, which is in c1. So drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1 (airport), load p1 into t1, drive to l1_5, unload.

But wait, a2 starts at l2_1. So flying a2 from l2_1 to l1_1. Then unload p1. Then load into t1, drive to l1_5.

But for p2: starts in l2_3 (c2). Need to get to l1_4 (c1). Also, constraints require that p2 is in l1_1 (so maybe via a1?), and in l2_1 (so via a2?), but also p2 must be in a1 at some point.

Wait, constraints say p2 must be in a1. So we need to get p2 into a1. But a1 is in c1's airport l1_1. So how to get p2 there?

But p2 starts in c2. So perhaps the plan is:

For p2:

- Use t2 (in l2_3) to load p2 (since both are in l2_3). Then drive t2 to l2_1 (airport), unload p2, load into a2. Fly a2 to l1_1. Then unload p2 into l1_1. Then load into a1 (which is at l1_1) and fly somewhere? Or maybe after unloading from a2, load into a1 and fly to another location?

Wait, but p2's final destination is l1_4 in c1. So after getting p2 to l1_1, we need to use a truck in c1. t1 is in l1_4. So drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1, load p2, drive back to l1_4, unload. But then how does that satisfy the constraint that when p2 is in l1_4, there was an earlier state where p1 was in l1_4. Wait, p1's final destination is l1_5. So perhaps p1 is first brought to l1_4, then to l1_5. That would make sense.

So let's think of the steps for both packages:

For p1:

1. Move p1 from l2_5 to l2_1 via truck t2. So:

- Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_5 (c2)
- Load p1 into t2 at l2_5
- Drive t2 to l2_1 (airport)
- Unload p1 at l2_1
- Load p1 into a2
- Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1
- Unload p1 from a2 into l1_1
- Now, p1 is in l1_1. Need to get it to l1_5. Use truck t1 (in l1_4):

- Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1 (c1)
- Load p1 into t1
- Drive t1 to l1_5
- Unload p1 into l1_5

For p2:

1. Move p2 from l2_3 to l2_1 via t2 (same truck used earlier for p1? But need to check timing):

Wait, t2 is initially at l2_3. So first, drive t2 to l2_5 to pick up p1. Then drive back to l2_1. But after that, t2 is at l2_1. But p2 is initially in l2_3. So perhaps, before moving t2 to l2_5, we first load p2 into t2 at l2_3, then drive t2 to l2_1, unload p2, load into a2. Then, after that, use t2 again to pick up p1. Wait, but that might complicate the order.

Alternatively, maybe use t2 for p2 first. Let's see:

But p1 is in l2_5, and p2 is in l2_3. So t2 is in l2_3. So first, load p2 into t2 (since both are in l2_3), then drive t2 to l2_1, unload p2. Then load p2 into a2. Fly a2 to l1_1. Then unload p2. Then load p2 into a1 (to satisfy the constraint that p2 is in a1). Then maybe fly a1 to another airport? Wait, a1 is already at l1_1, which is the airport in c1. So if we load p2 into a1 at l1_1, then perhaps fly a1 to another location in c1 (but airplanes can only fly between airports, and the other locations in c1 are not airports except l1_1. Wait, the airports are l1_1 and l2_1. So to fly a1, it can only move between airports. So l1_1 is in c1, and other airports are in other cities. So a1 can't fly to other cities' airports. Wait, the flyairplane action allows flying between any airports. So if there's another airport in c1, but according to the problem statement, each city has one airport. So in c1, the airport is l1_1. So if we fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1 (c2's airport), but that would take it out of c1. But we need to get p2 to l1_4 in c1. So perhaps after p2 is unloaded from a2 into l1_1, then load into a1 (so that p2 is in a1, satisfying the constraint). Then unload p2 from a1 back into l1_1 (since a1 can't fly anywhere else unless there's another airport). Wait, but the problem states that each city has one airport. So a1 can't fly to another location within c1. So perhaps once p2 is in l1_1, we need to use a truck to move it. Let's see:

So for p2's path:

- Load p2 into t2 (l2_3)
- Drive t2 to l2_1 (airport)
- Unload p2 at l2_1
- Load p2 into a2
- Fly a2 to l1_1
- Unload p2 into l1_1 (now p2 is in l1_1, satisfying the first constraint)
- Now, load p2 into a1 (to satisfy "p2 is in a1")
- Then unload p2 from a1 back into l1_1
- Then load p2 into t1 (truck in c1, which needs to be driven to l1_1)
- Drive t1 to l1_4, unload p2.

But wait, the constraint says that when p2 is in l1_4, there must be an earlier state where p1 was in l1_4. So perhaps p1 needs to be in l1_4 before p2 arrives there. That suggests that p1 is first taken to l1_4, then to l1_5, while p2 is taken to l1_4 afterward.

But let's look at the steps again. The trucks in c1 are t1 (initially at l1_4). So for p1, after arriving at l1_1 via a2, we need to drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1 to pick up p1, then drive to l1_5. So:

- Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1 (load p1)
- Drive to l1_5, unload.

But during this, t1 is in l1_4 initially. So when t1 moves to l1_1, it leaves l1_4. Then after loading p1, drives to l1_5. So p1 is in l1_5.

But for p2, after arriving in l1_1 via a2, then to get to l1_4, we need to use t1 again. But t1 is now in l1_5. Wait, that's a problem. Because after delivering p1 to l1_5, t1 is in l1_5. So we need to get t1 back to l1_1 to pick up p2. That's an extra step. Alternatively, maybe we can use t1 to first deliver p1 to l1_5, then return to l1_1 to get p2. But that adds more steps. But the problem requires the optimal plan (shortest possible). Hmm, maybe there's a way to combine the steps.

Alternatively, perhaps after delivering p1 to l1_5, t1 is in l1_5. Then drive t1 back to l1_1 to get p2. Then drive to l1_4. But that's two extra steps. Let's see.

Alternatively, maybe p2 is loaded into a1 at l1_1, then a1 flies to another airport. Wait, but a1 can only fly to other airports. For example, fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1 (c2's airport). But why would we do that? That would take p2 back to c2. Not helpful.

Alternatively, after p2 is in l1_1, we can use t1 to transport it. But t1 is initially at l1_4. So to get t1 to l1_1, we need to drive it there. But if t1 is used to transport p1 first, then it's at l1_5. So maybe the order of handling p1 and p2 matters.

Wait, perhaps handle p2 first? Let's think. But p1 is in c2, p2 is also in c2. Maybe we can transport both packages in the same airplane flight. Let's see.

But a2 can carry both p1 and p2. So after loading both into a2 at l2_1, fly to l1_1. Then unload both. But how to get both packages to l2_1?

p1 is in l2_5. So t2 needs to go to l2_5, pick up p1, drive to l2_1. Then t2 can go back to l2_3 to get p2, drive to l2_1. Then load both into a2. But that's two trips for t2. So steps:

1. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_5 (to get p1)
2. Load p1 into t2
3. Drive t2 to l2_1
4. Unload p1 into l2_1
5. Drive t2 back to l2_3
6. Load p2 into t2
7. Drive t2 to l2_1
8. Unload p2 into l2_1
9. Load both p1 and p2 into a2
10. Fly a2 to l1_1
11. Unload p1 and p2 into l1_1

But steps 5-8 add extra driving. Maybe that's not optimal. Alternatively, after dropping p1 at l2_1, can t2 drive back to l2_3 and pick up p2 in the same trip? Let's see:

After step 4 (p1 is in l2_1), t2 is at l2_1. To pick up p2 which is in l2_3, t2 would need to drive back to l2_3, which is in city c2. So steps:

After step 4:

5. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_3 (c2)
6. Load p2 into t2
7. Drive t2 back to l2_1
8. Unload p2 into l2_1
Then load both into a2.

This would require steps 5-8, which adds 4 steps. So total steps for t2 would be: drive to l2_5, load p1, drive to l2_1, unload. Then drive to l2_3, load p2, drive to l2_1, unload. Then load both into a2. Then fly. Then unload. Then proceed in c1.

But maybe combining these steps is better. But the problem requires an optimal plan. Let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps use a2 to make two trips. But airplanes can only fly if they are at the starting airport. So a2 starts at l2_1. So first, load p2 into a2, fly to l1_1, unload, then fly back to l2_1 to get p1. But that's two flights. But maybe that's more steps. Let's compare.

Alternatively, let's think of the steps for p1 and p2 separately.

For p1:

- t2 drives from l2_3 to l2_5 (load p1)
- drive to l2_1, unload p1
- load into a2, fly to l1_1, unload p1.

For p2:

- t2 is at l2_1 after transporting p1. To get p2, which is at l2_3, need to drive t2 back to l2_3, load p2, drive to l2_1, unload, load into a2, fly to l1_1.

But this would require t2 to make two trips. So steps for p1 and p2 would be interleaved.

But perhaps it's more efficient to first handle p2. Let's try:

1. Load p2 into t2 at l2_3 (since both are there)
2. Drive t2 to l2_1
3. Unload p2 at l2_1
4. Load p2 into a2
5. Fly a2 to l1_1
6. Unload p2 into l1_1 (now p2 is in l1_1, satisfying constraint that it is in l1_1 at some state)
   - Also, when p2 is in l1_1, the first constraint requires that in an earlier state, p1 was in l1_4 or p2 was in l1_2. But currently, neither is true. So this would violate the constraint. Therefore, this sequence would not be valid.

Ah, right! The first constraint says that if p2 is in l1_1, there must be an earlier state where p1 is in l1_4 or p2 is in l1_2. So we need to ensure that before p2 arrives in l1_1, one of those conditions is met.

So, for example, if before p2 is in l1_1, we have p1 in l1_4 or p2 in l1_2.

But p1 is initially in l2_5. So how can p1 be in l1_4 before p2 is in l1_1?

Alternatively, have p2 pass through l1_2. But l1_2 is in c1. So p2 would need to be in c1's l1_2, which would require being transported there.

But p2 is starting in c2. So to get to l1_2 in c1, it would need to be flown to l1_1, then driven via truck to l1_2.

So if p2 is first brought to l1_2, then that would satisfy the condition. Let's see:

But if we do that, then:

For p2:

- Fly to l1_1, then load into truck t1 (drive to l1_2, unload). Then perhaps p2 is in l1_2. Then later, move p2 to l1_1 again. But this adds steps. But this is necessary to satisfy the constraint.

Alternatively, perhaps p1 is brought to l1_4 first. Since p1's final destination is l1_5, which is in c1. So after p1 is in l1_1 (from a2), we can drive t1 to l1_1, load p1, drive to l1_4, unload (so p1 is in l1_4). Then drive to l1_5. But then, when p2 arrives in l1_1 later, the condition that p1 was in l1_4 earlier is satisfied.

So let's adjust the plan:

For p1:

1. t2 drives from l2_3 to l2_5 (c2)
2. load p1 into t2
3. drive t2 to l2_1 (airport)
4. unload p1
5. load p1 into a2
6. fly a2 to l1_1
7. unload p1 into l1_1
8. drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1
9. load p1 into t1
10. drive t1 to l1_4 (so p1 is in l1_4)
11. unload p1 into l1_4
12. then drive t1 to l1_5 and unload p1 there.

But step 11 leaves p1 in l1_4. Then, after that, when handling p2, we can meet the constraint that p1 was in l1_4 before p2 is in l1_4.

But also, when p2 is in l1_1 (step 7 in p2's plan), the earlier state where p1 is in l1_4 (from step 11) would satisfy the first constraint.

So this might work.

Now for p2:

1. t2 is at l2_1 after transporting p1. Wait, after step 4 (unload p1 at l2_1), t2 is at l2_1. Then, to transport p2:

2. drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_3 (p2 is here)
3. load p2 into t2
4. drive to l2_1
5. unload p2
6. load into a2
7. fly a2 to l1_1
8. unload p2 into l1_1 (now p2 is in l1_1, which requires that earlier p1 was in l1_4 or p2 was in l1_2. Since p1 was in l1_4 at step 11, which is after step 7 (unload p1 into l1_1), but before p2 arrives at l1_1. Wait, no. Let me check the order.

Wait, steps for p1 would be:

Steps 1-7: p1 is in l1_1 (after flying). Then steps 8-11: p1 is loaded into t1, driven to l1_4, unloaded there. So after step 11, p1 is in l1_4.

Then steps for p2:

After p1 is already in l1_4, then p2 is flown to l1_1. So when p2 is unloaded into l1_1 (step 8 of p2's plan), the earlier state where p1 is in l1_4 (step 11 of p1's plan) has already occurred. So the constraint is satisfied.

So that's good.

Now, after p2 is in l1_1, we need to load it into a1 to satisfy the constraint that p2 is in a1 at some state. Also, p1 needs to be in a1 at some state.

So steps:

After p2 is in l1_1:

9. load p2 into a1 (which is at l1_1)
10. then unload p2 from a1 back into l1_1 (since we need to move it to l1_4)
11. load p2 into t1 (assuming t1 is back in l1_4 or l1_1?)

Wait, after p1 is delivered to l1_5, t1 is at l1_5. So after step 12 (drive t1 to l1_5 and unload), t1 is in l1_5. So to move p2 from l1_1 to l1_4, we need t1 to be driven back to l1_1. So steps:

After p1 is in l1_5 (step 12 of p1's plan):

13. drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_1
14. load p2 into t1
15. drive to l1_4
16. unload p2 into l1_4 (goal achieved)

But when we unload p2 into l1_4 (step 16), the constraint requires that there was an earlier state where p1 was in l1_4. Which is true (step 11 of p1's plan).

Also, p2 needs to be in l2_1 at some state. When does that happen? Initially, p2 is in l2_3. Then it's driven to l2_1 (step 4 of p2's plan), so when it's in l2_1 (after step 5), that's a state where p2 is in l2_1. The constraint says that if p2 is in l2_1 in state s, then p1 must be in l1_4 at s or after. At the time p2 is in l2_1 (step 5 of p2's plan), p1 is still in l2_1 (wait no: after step 5, p2 is in l2_1, but p1 is in l1_1 at that point. Wait, let's track the timeline.

Let me outline the entire plan step by step, considering both packages:

1. For p1:
   a. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_5 (c2)
   b. Load p1 into t2 at l2_5
   c. Drive t2 to l2_1 (c2's airport)
   d. Unload p1 into l2_1
   e. Load p1 into a2
   f. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1 (c1's airport)
   g. Unload p1 into l1_1
   h. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1 (c1)
   i. Load p1 into t1
   j. Drive t1 to l1_4
   k. Unload p1 into l1_4
   l. Drive t1 to l1_5
   m. Unload p1 into l1_5 (goal achieved)

2. For p2:
   a. Drive t2 from l2_1 back to l2_3 (after step d)
   b. Load p2 into t2 at l2_3
   c. Drive t2 to l2_1
   d. Unload p2 into l2_1 (now p2 is in l2_1, satisfying the constraint. Now, according to constraint 3: if p2 is in l2_1 at state s, then p1 must be in l1_4 at s or after. At this point, p1 is in l1_1 (from step g), so this is not satisfied. Therefore, we need to ensure that after p2 is in l2_1, p1 is eventually in l1_4.

So the steps for p1 must include being in l1_4 after p2 is in l2_1. So the plan for p1 must reach step k (p1 in l1_4) after p2 is in l2_1 (step d of p2's plan). Let's check the order.

Let's interleave the steps:

Order of steps:

1. Drive t2 to l2_5 (p1)
2. Load p1 into t2
3. Drive t2 to l2_1
4. Unload p1 into l2_1
5. Load p1 into a2
6. Fly a2 to l1_1
7. Unload p1 into l1_1
8. Drive t1 to l1_1
9. Load p1 into t1
10. Drive t1 to l1_4
11. Unload p1 into l1_4 (now p1 is in l1_4)
12. Drive t1 to l1_5
13. Unload p1 into l1_5 (goal done)

Now for p2:

14. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_3 (but wait, after step 3, t2 is at l2_1. So after step 4, t2 is still at l2_1. Then after step 3 (drive t2 to l2_1), steps 4-13 are for p1. Then after that, steps for p2:

14. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_3 (to pick up p2)
15. Load p2 into t2
16. Drive t2 to l2_1
17. Unload p2 into l2_1 (now p2 is here. At this state (step 17), p1 is already in l1_4 (from step 11). So the constraint that when p2 is in l2_1, p1 must be in l1_4 at or after that state is satisfied because p1 is in l1_4 (step 11) before step 17.

Wait, no. If step 17 is when p2 is in l2_1, then step 11 (p1 in l1_4) happens before step 17. So the constraint is satisfied because p1 is in l1_4 at an earlier state than p2 being in l2_1. But the constraint says that if p2 is in l2_1 at state s, then p1 must be in l1_4 at s or after. In this case, p1 was in l1_4 before s, which is acceptable because "after s" includes s itself, but here it's before. Wait, no: if the condition is that p1 must be in l1_4 at s or after, but if it was in l1_4 before s, that doesn't satisfy. Because "at s or after" means that from s onwards, p1 is in l1_4.

So if p2 is in l2_1 at step 17, then p1 must be in l1_4 at step 17 or later. But in step 17, p1 is already in l1_5 (from step 13). So this would violate the constraint.

Ah, this is a problem. So when we unload p2 into l2_1 (step 17), p1 has already been moved to l1_5 (step 13). So p1 is no longer in l1_4. Therefore, the constraint is violated.

So we need to adjust the order. Perhaps the steps for p2 need to happen before p1 is moved to l1_5.

Let me reorganize the steps to ensure that when p2 is in l2_1, p1 is either in l1_4 or later in l1_4.

Wait, but once p1 is moved to l1_5, it's no longer in l1_4. So the constraint requires that when p2 is in l2_1, then p1 must be in l1_4 at that state or after. So during step 17 (p2 in l2_1), p1 must be in l1_4 at that time or later. But if p1 is already in l1_5 at that time, then the constraint is not met.

Therefore, we need to ensure that when p2 is in l2_1, p1 is either in l1_4 or will be moved there after. But since p1's final destination is l1_5, we need to have p1 in l1_4 at the same time or after p2 is in l2_1.

So perhaps we should move p2 to l2_1 before moving p1 to l1_5.

Let's try:

Plan for p1:

1. Drive t2 to l2_5, load p1, drive to l2_1, unload.
2. Load into a2, fly to l1_1, unload.
3. Drive t1 to l1_1, load p1, drive to l1_4, unload (now p1 is in l1_4).
4. (Hold here; don't move to l1_5 yet.)

Plan for p2:

5. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_3, load p2, drive back to l2_1, unload.
6. Load p2 into a2, fly to l1_1, unload.
7. Load p2 into a1 (satisfy constraint), unload.
8. Load p2 into t1 (which is at l1_4?), drive to l1_4, unload.

But wait, t1 is at l1_4 after step 3. So to move p2 from l1_1 to l1_4, we need t1 to come to l1_1.

So after step 3, t1 is at l1_4 (after unloading p1 there). To get p2 from l1_1 to l1_4:

9. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1 (load p2), then drive back to l1_4, unload p2.

But during this, p1 is still in l1_4. So when p2 is unloaded into l1_4, p1 is already there, which satisfies the constraint that p1 was in l1_4 before.

Then, after that, drive t1 to l1_5 to deliver p1.

So the steps would be:

1. (p1) t2 drives to l2_5, loads p1, drives to l2_1, unloads.
2. (p1) load p1 into a2, fly to l1_1, unload.
3. (p1) drive t1 to l1_1, load p1, drive to l1_4, unload (now p1 is in l1_4).
4. (p2) drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_3, load p2, drive to l2_1, unload.
   - Now p2 is in l2_1 (step 4). At this point, p1 is in l1_4. So the constraint is satisfied: when p2 is in l2_1 (now), p1 is in l1_4 (step 3) which is before, but the constraint says "at s or after". Wait, no: the constraint is that if p2 is in l2_1 in state s, then p1 must be in l1_4 at s or after. So at step 4 (p2 in l2_1), p1 is already in l1_4 (from step 3), which is before s. But the constraint requires that p1 is in l1_4 at s or after. So this would not satisfy the constraint. Therefore, we have a problem.

So, the order must be such that when p2 is in l2_1 (step 4), p1 is in l1_4 at that state or later. But in this case, p1 is already in l1_4 before p2 is in l2_1. So it doesn't satisfy the constraint.

Thus, we need to adjust the plan so that when p2 is in l2_1, p1 is in l1_4 either at the same time or later. How?

Perhaps p1 is loaded into l1_4 after p2 is in l2_1.

So reordering:

First, transport p2 to l2_1, then transport p1 to l1_4.

Let's try:

Plan:

1. (p2) Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_3 (wait, no. Initially, t2 is in l2_3. So load p2 into t2 (both are in l2_3).
   - Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
2. Drive t2 to l2_1
3. Unload p2 into l2_1
   - Now p2 is in l2_1. Now, the constraint is that if p2 is in l2_1 (state s), then p1 must be in l1_4 at s or after. So we need to ensure that p1 is in l1_4 at or after this state.

Then proceed to handle p1.

But p1 is in l2_5. So steps for p1:

4. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_5
5. Load p1 into t2
6. Drive to l2_1, unload
7. Load into a2, fly to l1_1
8. Unload p1 into l1_1
9. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1, load p1, drive to l1_4, unload (p1 in l1_4)
10. Then drive to l1_5, unload.

Now, when p2 is in l2_1 (step 3), p1 hasn't been moved yet. So at that state, p1 is still in l2_5. Then, after step 3, we move p1. So after step 9, p1 is in l1_4. So in step 3 (p2 in l2_1), p1 is not in l1_4, but after step 9, p1 is in l1_4. So the constraint is satisfied because p1 is in l1_4 after step 3.

But the constraint says "must hold at s or after s". So if in state s (p2 in l2_1), p1 is not in l1_4, but later becomes so, that's acceptable.

So this works. So the order is:

1. Load p2 into t2, drive to l2_1 (steps 1-3)
2. Then handle p1, get it to l1_4 (steps 4-9)
3. Then fly p2 to l1_1, and so on.

But after step 3, p2 is in l2_1. Then steps 4-6: t2 is used to move p1 from l2_5 to l2_1. So steps 4-6 would be:

4. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_5 (load p1)
5. Load p1 into t2
6. Drive to l2_1, unload
7. Load into a2, fly to l1_1, unload
8. Drive t1 to l1_1, load p1, drive to l1_4, unload (now p1 is in l1_4)

Then, for p2:

9. Load p2 into a2 (at l2_1), fly to l1_1, unload
   - Wait, a2 is at l1_1 after step 7. Oh no, after step 7, a2 flew from l2_1 to l1_1. So a2 is now at l1_1. So to load p2 into a2, we need a2 to be back at l2_1. But after step 7, a2 is in l1_1. So we can't use a2 to fly p2 unless we fly it back to l2_1.

This is a problem. Because after transporting p1 to l1_1, a2 is in l1_1. To get p2 from l2_1 to l1_1, we need a2 to be in l2_1 again. But airplanes can't be in two places at once. So after step 7, a2 is in l1_1. So to fly p2, we need to fly a2 back to l2_1. But that would take an extra step.

So steps would be:

After step 7 (a2 is in l1_1):

8. Fly a2 from l1_1 back to l2_1 (to pick up p2)
9. Load p2 into a2
10. Fly a2 back to l1_1
11. Unload p2 into l1_1

But this adds steps 8-11, which increases the plan length. But since we need to optimize, perhaps there's a better way.

Alternatively, use airplane a1 to transport p2. But a1 is in l1_1 initially. So to get a1 to l2_1, we need to fly it there. But a1 is in c1's airport. So steps:

But why would we do that? Let's see:

After p2 is in l2_1 (step 3):

4. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1
5. Load p2 into a1
6. Fly a1 back to l1_1
7. Unload p2 into l1_1

This way, p2 is transported via a1. But this requires flying a1 to l2_1 and back.

But this also uses a1, which is needed for the constraints that p1 and p2 must be in a1 at some point.

So perhaps this is a better approach.

Let's try:

Plan:

For p2:

1. Load p2 into t2 at l2_3
2. Drive t2 to l2_1
3. Unload p2 into l2_1 (now p2 is here)
4. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1 (to pick up p2)
5. Load p2 into a1
6. Fly a1 back to l1_1
7. Unload p2 into l1_1 (now p2 is in l1_1)
   - This satisfies the constraint that p2 is in a1 (step 5)
   - Also, when p2 is in l1_1, the earlier state must have p1 in l1_4 or p2 in l1_2. But at this point, p1 is still in l2_5. So we need to handle that.

For p1:

8. Drive t2 (which is at l2_1 after step 3) to l2_5
9. Load p1 into t2
10. Drive to l2_1
11. Unload p1
12. Load into a2 (which is at l2_1)
13. Fly a2 to l1_1
14. Unload p1 into l1_1
15. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1
16. Load p1 into t1
17. Drive to l1_4, unload (now p1 is in l1_4)
18. Drive to l1_5, unload (goal)

For p2 (continued):

19. After step 7 (p2 in l1_1), load into t1 (assuming t1 is at l1_4, but after step 15-17, t1 is at l1_4, then driven to l1_1. Wait, step 15: drive t1 to l1_1. So after step 15, t1 is in l1_1. Then step 16: load p1 into t1. Then drive to l1_4 (step 17). So after step 17, t1 is in l1_4. Then step 18: drive to l1_5. So after step 18, t1 is in l1_5.

So to move p2 from l1_1 to l1_4, after step 7 (p2 in l1_1), we need t1 to be available. But after step 18, t1 is in l1_5. So we need to drive t1 back to l1_1.

19. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_1 (after step 18)
20. Load p2 into t1
21. Drive to l1_4
22. Unload p2 (goal)

But this adds several steps. Also, during step 7 (p2 in l1_1), the constraint requires that earlier there was p1 in l1_4 or p2 in l1_2. At step 7, p1 is still in l2_1 (step 11), so no. So this approach doesn't satisfy the first constraint.

This is getting complicated. Let's try to outline a plan that meets all constraints step by step, ensuring each constraint is satisfied.

Let's list all constraints again:

1. p2 must be in l1_1 at some state. And when that happens, there must be an earlier state where p1 is in l1_4 or p2 is in l1_2.
2. p2 must be in l2_1 at some state. When that happens, p1 must be in l1_4 at or after that state.
3. p2 must end in l1_4, and when that happens, there must be an earlier state where p1 was in l1_4.
4. p1 must be in a1 at some state.
5. p2 must be in a1 at some state.

Also, the goal is p1 in l1_5 and p2 in l1_4.

Let's try to satisfy the constraints in order:

First, ensure p2 is in l2_1 and l1_1 at some states.

For p2 to be in l2_1: transport it via truck t2 from l2_3 to l2_1.

For p2 to be in l1_1: transport it via airplane to l1_1.

But to get p2 into an airplane, it needs to be in an airport. So first, truck t2 takes p2 to l2_1 (airport of c2), then load into a2, fly to l1_1.

But during that flight, p2 is in a2, not a1. So to satisfy the constraint that p2 is in a1, we need to load p2 into a1 at some point.

Similarly, p1 must be in a1.

So perhaps after transporting p2 to l1_1 via a2, we load p2 into a1.

So steps:

1. Load p2 into t2 (l2_3), drive to l2_1, unload. Now p2 is in l2_1 (constraint 3).
   - At this point, to satisfy constraint 2 (when p2 is in l2_1, p1 must be in l1_4 at or after). So after this step, p1 must eventually be in l1_4.

2. Load p2 into a2, fly to l1_1, unload. Now p2 is in l1_1 (constraint 1).
   - To satisfy constraint 1, before this step, there must be a state where p1 is in l1_4 or p2 in l1_2. At this point, p1 is still in l2_5, so neither. So we need to insert steps where p1 is in l1_4 or p2 is in l1_2 before this.

So maybe before flying p2 to l1_1, we have p1 in l1_4.

But p1 is in l2_5. So steps for p1:

3. Drive t2 (now at l2_1 after step 1) to l2_5, load p1, drive back to l2_1, unload.

4. Load p1 into a2, fly to l1_1, unload.

5. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1, load p1, drive to l1_4, unload. Now p1 is in l1_4.

Now, after step 5, p1 is in l1_4. Then, we can proceed to fly p2 to l1_1 (step 2). But wait, the order is:

Steps 1: p2 in l2_1.

Steps 3-5: p1 moved to l1_4.

Then step 2: fly p2 to l1_1. Now, when p2 is in l1_1 (step 2 after steps 3-5), the earlier state where p1 is in l1_4 (step 5) satisfies constraint 1.

Yes. So the order would be:

1. p2 to l2_1.

3. p1 moved to l1_4.

2. p2 flown to l1_1.

But this requires reordering steps. So:

1. p2 loaded into t2, driven to l2_1.

3. t2 driven to l2_5, load p1, drive back to l2_1.

4. p1 flown to l1_1.

5. p1 driven to l1_4.

2. p2 flown to l1_1.

But this is getting complicated. Let's try to outline the steps in order:

1. Load p2 into t2 at l2_3.

2. Drive t2 to l2_1. Unload p2. (p2 in l2_1, constraint 3)

3. Load p2 into a2.

4. Fly a2 to l1_1. Unload p2. (p2 in l1_1, constraint 1)

But at this step, to satisfy constraint 1's earlier state, we need p1 in l1_4 or p2 in l1_2 before this. Neither is true yet.

So we need to interleave steps for p1.

Let's try:

1. Load p2 into t2, drive to l2_1. Unload. (p2 in l2_1)

2. Load p2 into a2, fly to l1_1. Unload. (p2 in l1_1)

But this violates constraint 1 because there's no earlier state with p1 in l1_4 or p2 in l1_2.

So need to handle p1 first.

Alternative approach:

First, get p1 to l1_4, then handle p2.

For p1:

1. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_5 (c2).

2. Load p1 into t2.

3. Drive t2 to l2_1.

4. Unload p1.

5. Load into a2.

6. Fly a2 to l1_1.

7. Unload p1.

8. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1.

9. Load p1 into t1.

10. Drive to l1_4. Unload. (p1 in l1_4)

Now, p1 is in l1_4. Then handle p2:

11. Load p2 into t2 at l2_3.

12. Drive t2 to l2_1. Unload. (p2 in l2_1, constraint 3)

   - Now, when p2 is in l2_1 (step 12), p1 is in l1_4 (step 10), which satisfies constraint 2.

13. Load p2 into a2.

14. Fly a2 to l1_1. Unload. (p2 in l1_1, constraint 1)

   - Now, before this step (step 14), the earlier state where p1 is in l1_4 (step 10) exists, satisfying constraint 1.

15. Load p2 into a1 (at l1_1). (satisfies constraint 5)

16. Unload p2 from a1 into l1_1.

17. Load p2 into t1 (which is in l1_4 after step 10? No. After step 10, t1 is at l1_4. So need to drive t1 back to l1_1:

    a. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1.

    b. Load p2 into t1.

    c. Drive to l1_4. Unload. (p2 in l1_4, goal)

18. Then drive t1 to l1_5 to deliver p1.

Wait, but p1 is already in l1_4 (step 10). To get p1 to l1_5:

19. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_5. Unload p1.

But after step 10, p1 is in l1_4. So steps 17-19:

After step 10:

17. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1 (to get p2).

18. Load p2 into t1.

19. Drive to l1_4. Unload p2 (goal achieved).

20. Drive t1 back to l1_5. But p1 is already in l1_4. Wait, no. p1 was unloaded in l1_4 (step 10). To get p1 to l1_5:

21. Load p1 into t1 (which is at l1_4 after step 19).

22. Drive to l1_5. Unload.

But wait, after step 10, p1 is in l1_4. t1 is at l1_4. So step 10: t1 is at l1_4, p1 is there. Then step 17: drive t1 to l1_1 (empty). Then step 18: load p2 into t1. Drive back to l1_4 (step 19), unload p2. Then t1 is at l1_4. Then, load p1 into t1 (step 21), drive to l1_5 (step 22), unload.

This seems to work.

Now, checking all constraints:

- p2 in l1_1: step 14. Before this, p1 was in l1_4 (step 10). Satisfies constraint 1.

- p2 in l2_1: step 12. At that time, p1 is in l1_4 (step 10). So satisfies constraint 2.

- p2 in l1_4: step 19. Earlier state where p1 was in l1_4 (step 10). Satisfies constraint 3.

- p1 in a1: need to check. In the current plan, p1 is never loaded into a1. So we need to add steps where p1 is loaded into a1.

Similarly, p2 is loaded into a1 in step 15.

So to satisfy constraint 4 (p1 in a1), we need to load p1 into a1.

So perhaps after step 7 (p1 in l1_1), load p1 into a1, then unload.

Adding steps:

7a. Load p1 into a1 (at l1_1).

7b. Unload p1 from a1 into l1_1.

Then proceed with step 8.

This way, p1 is in a1 (step 7a), satisfying constraint 4.

So updating the plan:

1. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_5.

2. Load p1 into t2.

3. Drive to l2_1. Unload.

4. Load p1 into a2.

5. Fly a2 to l1_1. Unload.

6. Load p1 into a1.

7. Unload p1 into l1_1.

8. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1.

9. Load p1 into t1.

10. Drive to l1_4. Unload. (p1 in l1_4)

11. Load p2 into t2 at l2_3.

12. Drive to l2_1. Unload. (p2 in l2_1)

13. Load p2 into a2.

14. Fly to l1_1. Unload. (p2 in l1_1)

15. Load p2 into a1. Unload. (p2 in l1_1)

16. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1.

17. Load p2 into t1.

18. Drive to l1_4. Unload. (p2 in l1_4)

19. Load p1 into t1.

20. Drive to l1_5. Unload. (p1 in l1_5)

This plan now includes p1 being in a1 (step 6), p2 in a1 (step 15), p2 in l1_1 (step 14), p2 in l2_1 (step 12), p2 in l1_4 (step 18), and p1 in l1_4 (step 10). All constraints are satisfied.

Now, let's check the order and steps:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
3. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
5. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
6. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
7. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
8. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
9. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
10. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
11. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
12. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
13. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
14. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
15. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
16. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
17. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
18. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
19. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
20. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
21. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
22. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
23. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
24. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
25. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
26. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
27. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
28. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1
29. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5

This seems too long. But perhaps there's a way to optimize steps.

Wait, after step 13, p1 is in l1_4. Then, steps 14-17 handle moving p2 to l2_1. But perhaps there's a more efficient way.

Alternatively, after step 5 (fly a2 to l1_1), a2 is now in l1_1. To fly p2, we need to fly a2 back to l2_1. Which would require:

After step 5: a2 is in l1_1.

6. fly a2 from l1_1 to l2_1 (empty)
7. load p2 into a2
8. fly back to l1_1
9. unload p2

But this adds more steps.

Alternatively, use a different airplane for p2. a1 is in l1_1. So to transport p2 from l2_1 to l1_1, we need to fly a1 to l2_1.

So after step 12 (p2 in l2_1):

13. fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1
14. load p2 into a1
15. fly a1 to l1_1
16. unload p2

This way, p2 is in a1 (satisfying constraint 5), and p1 was loaded into a1 earlier (step 8).

But let's rework the plan with this approach:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
3. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
5. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
6. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
7. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
8. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
9. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
10. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
11. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
12. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
13. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
14. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
15. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
16. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
17. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
18. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
19. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
20. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
21. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
22. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
23. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
24. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
25. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1
26. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5

Wait, step 25-26: p1 is in l1_4, needs to be moved to l1_5.

But after step 13, p1 is in l1_4. Then step 21, t1 is driven to l1_1, loaded with p2, and driven back to l1_4. So t1 is at l1_4 with p2. Then, after unloading p2 (step 24), t1 is at l1_4. To move p1 from l1_4 to l1_5:

25. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
26. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1
27. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5

So steps added. Now, checking constraints:

- p2 in l1_1: step 20 (unloaded from a1 into l1_1). Before that, p1 was in l1_4 (step 13). Satisfies constraint 1.

- p2 in l2_1: step 16. At that state, p1 is in l1_4 (step 13). Satisfies constraint 2.

- p2 in l1_4: step 24. Earlier state with p1 in l1_4 (step 13). Satisfies constraint 3.

- p1 in a1: step 8-9.

- p2 in a1: step 18-19.

This plan satisfies all constraints and the goal. Now, let's count the steps to see if it's optimal.

But perhaps there's a more optimal way. For example, combining steps where possible.

For instance, after step 7 (p1 in l1_1), load into a1 and unload, then load into t1. Maybe steps can be merged.

Alternatively, after step 7, directly load p1 into t1 without using a1. But then we need to include steps to load into a1 for the constraint.

Yes, but to satisfy the constraint that p1 is in a1, we need to have a step where p1 is loaded into a1.

So steps 8-9 are necessary.

Similarly, for p2, steps 17-20 are necessary to fly a1 to l2_1, load p2, fly back, and unload.

This seems to be the most efficient way.

Thus, the final plan is as outlined, with steps ensuring all constraints are met.
