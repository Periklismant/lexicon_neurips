Alright, let's break down this complex logistics planning problem. My task is to suggest a plan that brings packages p1 and p2 to their desired destinations while adhering to the specified constraints.

First, let me clarify what the target goal is:
- Package p1 should be in location l1_3.
- Package p2 should be in location l1_1.

And there are several constraints I need to ensure in the plan. Let me process them one by one:

1. Package p1 must be in location l2_1 at least once.
2. If p1 is in l2_1, it must have been in l1_1 or l2_2 at an earlier state.
3. Package p1 must be in location l1_5 at least once.
4. Package p1 must be in location l2_3 at least once.
5. If p1 is in l2_3 (at state s), then p1 must be in l2_5 or p2 must be in l2_4 at or after that state.
6. Package p2 must be in location l2_1 at least once.
7. If p2 is in l2_1 (at state s), then p2 must be in l1_5 at or after that state.
8. Package p2 must be in location l1_4 at least once.

Now, let's clarify the initial state of the world. It looks like there's some confusion in the initial state description. It says "Package t1 is in location l1_4" and "Package t2 is in location l2_5", but t1 and t2 are trucks, not packages. Similarly, it says "Package a1 is in location l1_1" and "Package a2 is in location l2_1", but a1 and a2 are airplanes, not packages. Let me correctly interpret this:

- Truck t1 is in location l1_4.
- Truck t2 is in location l2_5.
- Package p1 is in location l2_3.
- Package p2 is in location l2_2.
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (which is the airport of city c1).
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1 (which is the airport of city c2).

With this understanding, let's start planning:

Constraint 4 is already satisfied in the initial state, as package p1 is in l2_3. Given Constraint 5, we need to ensure that either p1 is in l2_5 or p2 is in l2_4 at or after the initial state. Since p1 is already in l2_3, we need to satisfy this constraint right away. 

Let's plan the movements for p1 and p2:

For p1:
1. Start at l2_3.
2. Need to visit l2_1 (Constraint 1), but before doing that, p1 needs to be in l1_1 or l2_2 (Constraint 2).
3. Need to visit l1_5 (Constraint 3).
4. Need to end at l1_3.

For p2:
1. Start at l2_2.
2. Need to visit l1_4 (Constraint 8).
3. Need to visit l2_1 (Constraint 6), and after that, need to visit l1_5 (Constraint 7).
4. Need to end at l1_1.

Given Constraint 5 and the initial position of p1 in l2_3, we need to immediately ensure that either p1 is in l2_5 or p2 is in l2_4. Since p2 is initially in l2_2, it's more straightforward to move p2 to l2_4.

Let's develop a plan step by step:

1. Move truck t2 from l2_5 to l2_2.
2. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_2.
3. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_4 (to satisfy Constraint 5 since p1 is in l2_3).
4. Now we need to continue the journey for both packages.

For p1's journey: We need to move p1 from l2_3 to either l1_1 or l2_2 to satisfy Constraint 2. Let's say we move it to l2_2.
5. Move truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_3.
6. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_3.
7. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_2.
8. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_2 (to satisfy Constraint 2).
9. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_2.
10. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1.
11. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1 (to satisfy Constraint 1).

Now, p1 needs to be transported to l1_5 (Constraint 3) and then to its final destination l1_3. We'll use airplanes for inter-city transport.
12. Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1.
13. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
14. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1.
15. Move truck t1 from l1_4 to l1_1.
16. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_1.
17. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_5.
18. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_5 (to satisfy Constraint 3).
19. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_5.
20. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_3.
21. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_3 (to reach its final destination).

For p2's journey: p2 is already in l2_4 (from steps 1-3). We need to move it to l2_1 (Constraint 6) and then to l1_5 (Constraint 7), l1_4 (Constraint 8), and finally to l1_1.
22. Drive t2 from l2_2 (after step 9) to l2_4.
23. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_4.
24. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_4.
25. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
26. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1 (to satisfy Constraint 6).
27. Load p2 onto a2 at l2_1.
28. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1 (assuming a2 has returned to l2_1 after step 14).
29. Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1.
30. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_1 (assuming t1 has returned to l1_1 after step 21).
31. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_5.
32. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_5 (to satisfy Constraint 7).
33. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_5.
34. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_4.
35. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_4 (to satisfy Constraint 8).
36. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_4.
37. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1.
38. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1 (to reach its final destination).

However, there seems to be a logical issue with the steps 22-38. I'm assuming that t2 is already in l2_2 after step 9, but that's inaccurate. Let me revise the plan for better accuracy.

Actually, let's start fresh with a clearer and more structured plan. I'll carefully define the locations of all vehicles and packages at each step.

Initial state:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_4 (city c1).
- Truck t2 is in location l2_5 (city c2).
- Package p1 is in location l2_3 (city c2).
- Package p2 is in location l2_2 (city c2).
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (city c1).
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1 (city c2).

Given the constraints, here's a more structured plan:

1. Move p2 to l2_4 to satisfy Constraint 5 (since p1 is in l2_3).
2. For p1, visit l2_2 (to satisfy Constraint 2), then l2_1 (Constraint 1), then transport to city c1, and visit l1_5 (Constraint 3) before reaching its final destination l1_3.
3. For p2, after l2_4, visit l2_1 (Constraint 6), then city c1, visit l1_5 (Constraint 7), then l1_4 (Constraint 8), and finally reach l1_1.

Let's replan step by step:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2 (Move t2 to load p2)
2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (Load p2 onto t2)
3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2 (Move p2 to l2_4 - to satisfy Constraint 5)
4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (Unload p2 at l2_4)

Now, we need to move truck t2 to get p1:
5. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2 (Move t2 to load p1)
6. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (Load p1 onto t2)
7. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2 (Move p1 to l2_2 - to satisfy Constraint 2)
8. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (Unload p1 at l2_2)
9. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (Load p1 onto t2 again)
10. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 (Move p1 to l2_1 - to satisfy Constraint 1)
11. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (Unload p1 at l2_1)

Now, we need to transport p1 to city c1:
12. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (Load p1 onto a2)
13. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (Fly a2 to city c1's airport)
14. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (Unload p1 at l1_1)

Now, we need to pick up p1 with t1:
15. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 (Move t1 to load p1)
16. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (Load p1 onto t1)
17. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1 (Move p1 to l1_5 - to satisfy Constraint 3)
18. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 (Unload p1 at l1_5)
19. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 (Load p1 onto t1 again)
20. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1 (Move p1 to l1_3 - its final destination)
21. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (Unload p1 at l1_3)

Now, let's transport p2 from l2_4 to its final destination l1_1:
22. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2 (Move t2 to load p2)
23. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (Load p2 onto t2)
24. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2 (Move p2 to l2_1 - to satisfy Constraint 6)
25. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (Unload p2 at l2_1)

Now, we need to transport p2 to city c1:
26. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (Load p2 onto a2)
27. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1 (Fly a2 back to l2_1) (Note: a2, after step 14, is in l1_1)
28. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (Load p2 onto a2)
29. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (Fly a2 to city c1's airport)
30. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (Unload p2 at l1_1)

Hmm, I see there's a mistake in the above plan. If a2 is in l1_1 after step 14, and we want to use it to transport p2 from l2_1 to l1_1, we first need to fly a2 back to l2_1. Let me reorganize:

27. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1 (Fly a2 back to city c2's airport)
28. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (Load p2 onto a2)
29. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (Fly a2 to city c1's airport)
30. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (Unload p2 at l1_1)

Now, we need to pick up p2 with t1 (which, after step 21, is in l1_3):
31. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1 (Move t1 to load p2)
32. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (Load p2 onto t1)
33. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1 (Move p2 to l1_5 - to satisfy Constraint 7)
34. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 (Unload p2 at l1_5)
35. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 (Load p2 onto t1 again)
36. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1 (Move p2 to l1_4 - to satisfy Constraint 8)
37. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (Unload p2 at l1_4)
38. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (Load p2 onto t1 again)
39. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 (Move p2 to l1_1 - its final destination)
40. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (Unload p2 at l1_1)

With this plan, both packages should be at their final destinations (p1 at l1_3 and p2 at l1_1), and all constraints should be satisfied.

Let me review for optimality and correctness:

Ah, I noticed an issue in steps 26-30. After step 25, p2 is unloaded at l2_1, so I don't need to fly a2 back to l2_1. I can simply use a2 which is already at l1_1.

The revised steps 26-30 should be:
26. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (Load p2, which is at l2_1, onto a2, which is also at l2_1)
27. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (Fly a2 to city c1's airport)
28. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (Unload p2 at l1_1)

But wait, after step 14, a2 is in l1_1, not l2_1. I need to fly a2 back to l2_1 first. The revised steps should be:
26. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1 (Fly a2 back to city c2's airport)
27. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (Load p2 onto a2)
28. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (Fly a2 to city c1's airport)
29. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (Unload p2 at l1_1)

But, I realize we can alternatively use airplane a1, which is already in l1_1, to fetch p2. This could be more efficient.

Revising steps 26-30 using a1:
26. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (Fly a1 from city c1's airport to city c2's airport)
27. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (Load p2 onto a1)
28. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1 (Fly a1 back to city c1's airport)
29. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (Unload p2 at l1_1)

This is the end of the transport for p2, and since the final destination for p2 is l1_1 (which is where we unloaded it), we're done with p2. But we need to recheck if we've satisfied all the constraints for p2.

For p2:
- Constraint 6: Package p2 must be in location l2_1 at least once. Satisfied in step 25.
- Constraint 7: If p2 is in l2_1, then p2 must be in l1_5 at or after that state. Satisfied in step 34.
- Constraint 8: Package p2 must be in location l1_4 at least once. Satisfied in step 37.

And the Constraint "p2 should be in l1_1" is satisfied in step 29.

In fact, we can skip steps 30-40 and simply have p2 end up in l1_1 after step 29, since it's already at its desired destination. This simplifies our plan significantly.

Let me rewrite the entire plan:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2 (Move t2 to load p2)
2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (Load p2 onto t2)
3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2 (Move p2 to l2_4 - to satisfy Constraint 5)
4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (Unload p2 at l2_4)
5. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2 (Move t2 to load p1)
6. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (Load p1 onto t2)
7. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2 (Move p1 to l2_2 - to satisfy Constraint 2)
8. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (Unload p1 at l2_2)
9. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (Load p1 onto t2 again)
10. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 (Move p1 to l2_1 - to satisfy Constraint 1)
11. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (Unload p1 at l2_1)
12. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (Load p1 onto a2)
13. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (Fly a2 to city c1's airport)
14. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (Unload p1 at l1_1)
15. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 (Move t1 to load p1)
16. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (Load p1 onto t1)
17. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1 (Move p1 to l1_5 - to satisfy Constraint 3)
18. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 (Unload p1 at l1_5)
19. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 (Load p1 onto t1 again)
20. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1 (Move p1 to l1_3 - its final destination)
21. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (Unload p1 at l1_3)
22. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2 (Move t2 to load p2)
23. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (Load p2 onto t2)
24. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2 (Move p2 to l2_1 - to satisfy Constraint 6)
25. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (Unload p2 at l2_1)

Now, we're at a point where p1 is at l1_3 (its desired destination) and p2 is at l2_1. For p2, we need to transport it to city c1 and have it visit locations l1_5 and l1_4 before ending up at l1_1.

Given that a2 is in l1_1 after step 14, we need to fly it back to l2_1 to pick up p2:

26. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1 (Fly a2 back to city c2's airport)
27. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (Load p2 onto a2)
28. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (Fly a2 to city c1's airport)
29. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (Unload p2 at l1_1)
30. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1 (Move t1 to load p2)
31. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (Load p2 onto t1)
32. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1 (Move p2 to l1_5 - to satisfy Constraint 7)
33. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 (Unload p2 at l1_5)
34. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 (Load p2 onto t1 again)
35. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1 (Move p2 to l1_4 - to satisfy Constraint 8)
36. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (Unload p2 at l1_4)
37. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (Load p2 onto t1 again)
38. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 (Move p2 to l1_1 - its final destination)
39. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (Unload p2 at l1_1)

With this plan, both packages are at their desired destinations.

Wait, there's an issue I need to address: Constraint 5 states "If p1 is in l2_3 (at state s), then p1 must be in l2_5 or p2 must be in l2_4 at or after that state."

Given that p1 is in l2_3 in the initial state, and we move p1 out of l2_3 in step 6, we need to ensure that either p1 is in l2_5 or p2 is in l2_4 by that time. In our plan, we move p2 to l2_4 in step 3 and unload it there in step 4. 

Let's quickly recheck the other constraints:

For p1:
- Constraint 1: Package p1 must be in location l2_1 at least once. Satisfied in step 11.
- Constraint 2: If p1 is in l2_1, it must have been in l1_1 or l2_2 at an earlier state. Satisfied in step 8.
- Constraint 3: Package p1 must be in location l1_5 at least once. Satisfied in step 18.
- Constraint 4: Package p1 must be in location l2_3 at least once. Satisfied in the initial state.
- Constraint 5: If p1 is in l2_3, then p1 must be in l2_5 or p2 must be in l2_4 at or after that state. Satisfied with p2 in l2_4 in steps 3-4.

For p2:
- Constraint 6: Package p2 must be in location l2_1 at least once. Satisfied in step 25.
- Constraint 7: If p2 is in l2_1, then p2 must be in l1_5 at or after that state. Satisfied in step 33.
- Constraint 8: Package p2 must be in location l1_4 at least once. Satisfied in step 36.

All constraints are satisfied. The final goal of having p1 in l1_3 and p2 in l1_1 is also achieved.

However, there's an optimization we can make. After step 29, p2 is already at l1_1, which is its desired destination. But we move it to l1_5 and l1_4 before returning it to l1_1 to satisfy the constraints. Instead, we can reorganize our plan to visit l1_5 and l1_4 before landing in l1_1 as the final step.

Let's optimize the steps for p2:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2 (Move t2 to load p2)
2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (Load p2 onto t2)
3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2 (Move p2 to l2_4 - to satisfy Constraint 5)
4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (Unload p2 at l2_4)
5. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2 (Move t2 to load p1)
6. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (Load p1 onto t2)
7. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2 (Move p1 to l2_2 - to satisfy Constraint 2)
8. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (Unload p1 at l2_2)
9. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (Load p1 onto t2 again)
10. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 (Move p1 to l2_1 - to satisfy Constraint 1)
11. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (Unload p1 at l2_1)
12. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (Load p1 onto a2)
13. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (Fly a2 to city c1's airport)
14. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (Unload p1 at l1_1)
15. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1 (Move t1 to l1_5 for satisfying Constraint 7 later)
16. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1 (Move t1 to load p1)
17. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (Load p1 onto t1)
18. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1 (Move p1 to l1_5 - to satisfy Constraint 3)
19. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 (Unload p1 at l1_5)
20. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 (Load p1 onto t1 again)
21. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1 (Move p1 to l1_3 - its final destination)
22. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (Unload p1 at l1_3)
23. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2 (Move t2 to load p2)
24. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (Load p2 onto t2)
25. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2 (Move p2 to l2_1 - to satisfy Constraint 6)
26. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (Unload p2 at l2_1)
27. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (Load p2 onto a2)
28. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1 (Fly a2 back to city c2's airport) (But wait, after step 14, a2 is in l1_1, so we need to fly it back to l2_1 first)

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me reorganize more coherently:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2 (Move t2 to load p2)
2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (Load p2 onto t2)
3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2 (Move p2 to l2_4 - to satisfy Constraint 5)
4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (Unload p2 at l2_4)
5. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2 (Move t2 to load p1)
6. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (Load p1 onto t2)
7. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2 (Move p1 to l2_2 - to satisfy Constraint 2)
8. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (Unload p1 at l2_2)
9. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (Load p1 onto t2 again)
10. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 (Move p1 to l2_1 - to satisfy Constraint 1)
11. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (Unload p1 at l2_1)
12. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (Load p1 onto a2)
13. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (Fly a2 to city c1's airport)
14. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (Unload p1 at l1_1)
15. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 (Move t1 to load p1)
16. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (Load p1 onto t1)
17. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1 (Move p1 to l1_5 - to satisfy Constraint 3)
18. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 (Unload p1 at l1_5)
19. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 (Load p1 onto t1 again)
20. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1 (Move p1 to l1_3 - its final destination)
21. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (Unload p1 at l1_3)

Now, the steps for p2:

22. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2 (Move t2 to load p2)
23. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (Load p2 onto t2)
24. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2 (Move p2 to l2_1 - to satisfy Constraint 6)
25. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (Unload p2 at l2_1)
26. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1 (Fly a2 back to city c2's airport) (a2 is at l1_1 after step 14)
27. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (Load p2 onto a2)
28. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (Fly a2 to city c1's airport)
29. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (Unload p2 at l1_1)
30. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (Load p2 onto t1) (t1 is at l1_3 after step 21, so we need to move it first)
31. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1 (Move t1 to load p2)
32. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (Load p2 onto t1)
33. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1 (Move p2 to l1_5 - to satisfy Constraint 7)
34. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 (Unload p2 at l1_5)
35. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 (Load p2 onto t1 again)
36. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1 (Move p2 to l1_4 - to satisfy Constraint 8)
37. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (Unload p2 at l1_4)
38. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (Load p2 onto t1 again)
39. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 (Move p2 to l1_1 - its final destination)
40. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (Unload p2 at l1_1)

This plan should satisfy all constraints and reach the goal.

Ah wait, we need to optimize this. I'm thinking too linearly. Let's try to interleave the transportation of the two packages more efficiently.

Given the constraints, here's a more optimized plan:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2 (Move t2 to load p2)
2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (Load p2 onto t2)
3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2 (Move p2 to l2_4 - to satisfy Constraint 5)
4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (Unload p2 at l2_4)
5. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2 (Move t2 to load p1)
6. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (Load p1 onto t2)
7. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2 (Move p1 to l2_2 - to satisfy Constraint 2)
8. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (Unload p1 at l2_2)
9. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (Load p1 onto t2 again)
10. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 (Move p1 to l2_1 - to satisfy Constraint 1)
11. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (Unload p1 at l2_1)
12. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2 (Move t2 to load p2)
13. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (Load p2 onto t2)
14. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2 (Move p2 to l2_1 - to satisfy Constraint 6)
15. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (Unload p2 at l2_1)
16. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (Load p1 onto a2)
17. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (Load p2 onto a1) (Let's assume a1 has been moved to l2_1 -- need to add steps for this)
18. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (Fly a2 to city c1's airport)
19. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (Unload p1 at l1_1)
20. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1 (Fly a1 to city c1's airport)
21. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (Unload p2 at l1_1)

Then, using truck t1 in city c1, we move both packages to their destinations:

22. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 (Move t1 to load p1 and p2)
23. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (Load p1 onto t1)
24. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1 (Move p1 to l1_5 - to satisfy Constraint 3)
25. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 (Unload p1 at l1_5)
26. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 (Load p1 onto t1 again)
27. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1 (Move p1 to l1_3 - its final destination)
28. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (Unload p1 at l1_3)
29. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1 (Move t1 back to load p2)
30. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (Load p2 onto t1)
31. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1 (Move p2 to l1_5 - to satisfy Constraint 7)
32. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 (Unload p2 at l1_5)
33. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 (Load p2 onto t1 again)
34. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1 (Move p2 to l1_4 - to satisfy Constraint 8)
35. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (Unload p2 at l1_4)
36. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (Load p2 onto t1 again)
37. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 (Move p2 to l1_1 - its final destination)
38. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (Unload p2 at l1_1)

I don't se any earlier place to start using the second airplane (a1). However, there's an issue in our revised plan. a1 is at l1_1 in the initial state, and we're trying to load p2 onto a1 at l2_1. We'll need to fly a1 to l2_1 first.

Let's fix it:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2 (Move t2 to load p2)
2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (Load p2 onto t2)
3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2 (Move p2 to l2_4 - to satisfy Constraint 5)
4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (Unload p2 at l2_4)
5. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2 (Move t2 to load p1)
6. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (Load p1 onto t2)
7. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2 (Move p1 to l2_2 - to satisfy Constraint 2)
8. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (Unload p1 at l2_2)
9. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (Load p1 onto t2 again)
10. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 (Move p1 to l2_1 - to satisfy Constraint 1)
11. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (Unload p1 at l2_1)
12. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2 (Move t2 to load p2)
13. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (Load p2 onto t2)
14. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2 (Move p2 to l2_1 - to satisfy Constraint 6)
15. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (Unload p2 at l2_1)
16. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (Load p1 onto a2)
17. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (Fly a1 to city c2's airport)
18. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (Load p2 onto a1)
19. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (Fly a2 to city c1's airport)
20. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (Unload p1 at l1_1)
21. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1 (Fly a1 to city c1's airport)
22. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (Unload p2 at l1_1)

Then, using truck t1 in city c1, we move both packages to their destinations:

23. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 (Move t1 to load p1 and p2)
24. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (Load p1 onto t1)
25. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1 (Move p1 to l1_5 - to satisfy Constraint 3)
26. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 (Unload p1 at l1_5)
27. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 (Load p1 onto t1 again)
28. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1 (Move p1 to l1_3 - its final destination)
29. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (Unload p1 at l1_3)
30. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1 (Move t1 back to load p2)
31. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (Load p2 onto t1)
32. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1 (Move p2 to l1_5 - to satisfy Constraint 7)
33. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 (Unload p2 at l1_5)
34. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 (Load p2 onto t1 again)
35. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1 (Move p2 to l1_4 - to satisfy Constraint 8)
36. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (Unload p2 at l1_4)
37. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (Load p2 onto t1 again)
38. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 (Move p2 to l1_1 - its final destination)
39. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (Unload p2 at l1_1)

This is a more optimized plan, and it should satisfy all the constraints.

Let's double-check all constraints:

1. Package p1 must be in location l2_1 at least once. Satisfied in step 11.
2. If p1 is in l2_1, it must have been in l1_1 or l2_2 at an earlier state. Satisfied in step 8.
3. Package p1 must be in location l1_5 at least once. Satisfied in step 26.
4. Package p1 must be in location l2_3 at least once. Satisfied in the initial state.
5. If p1 is in l2_3, then p1 must be in l2_5 or p2 must be in l2_4 at or after that state. Satisfied with p2 in l2_4 in steps 3-4.
6. Package p2 must be in location l2_1 at least once. Satisfied in step 15.
7. If p2 is in l2_1, then p2 must be in l1_5 at or after that state. Satisfied in step 33.
8. Package p2 must be in location l1_4 at least once. Satisfied in step 36.

All constraints are satisfied. The final goal of having p1 in l1_3 and p2 in l1_1 is also achieved.

(Actually, I'm thinking are we really optimizing here? The goal is to have a plan that's equal or less than the length of any other valid plan. I'm not sure if splitting the two packages to be transported via different airplanes is the most efficient approach. However, it's hard to do a direct one-to-one comparison without explicitly calculating the lengths of different valid plans.)

Let's finalize our plan:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2 (Move t2 to load p2)
2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (Load p2 onto t2)
3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2 (Move p2 to l2_4 - to satisfy Constraint 5)
4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (Unload p2 at l2_4)
5. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2 (Move t2 to load p1)
6. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (Load p1 onto t2)
7. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2 (Move p1 to l2_2 - to satisfy Constraint 2)
8. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (Unload p1 at l2_2)
9. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (Load p1 onto t2 again)
10. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 (Move p1 to l2_1 - to satisfy Constraint 1)
11. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (Unload p1 at l2_1)
12. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2 (Move t2 to load p2)
13. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (Load p2 onto t2)
14. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2 (Move p2 to l2_1 - to satisfy Constraint 6)
15. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (Unload p2 at l2_1)
16. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (Load p1 onto a2)
17. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (Fly a2 to city c1's airport)
18. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (Unload p1 at l1_1)
19. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1 (Fly a2 back to city c2's airport)
20. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (Load p2 onto a2)
21. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (Fly a2 to city c1's airport)
22. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (Unload p2 at l1_1)
23. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 (Move t1 to load p1 and p2)
24. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (Load p1 onto t1)
25. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1 (Move p1 to l1_5 - to satisfy Constraint 3)
26. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 (Unload p1 at l1_5)
27. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 (Load p1 onto t1 again)
28. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1 (Move p1 to l1_3 - its final destination)
29. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (Unload p1 at l1_3)
30. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1 (Move t1 back to load p2)
31. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (Load p2 onto t1)
32. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1 (Move p2 to l1_5 - to satisfy Constraint 7)
33. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 (Unload p2 at l1_5)
34. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 (Load p2 onto t1 again)
35. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1 (Move p2 to l1_4 - to satisfy Constraint 8)
36. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (Unload p2 at l1_4)
37. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (Load p2 onto t1 again)
38. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 (Move p2 to l1_1 - its final destination)
39. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (Unload p2 at l1_1)

This plan seems correct. I changed the approach to use the same airplane (a2) for both packages, rather than trying to use both airplanes. This is more efficient, as we don't have to send both airplanes to the other city.

Actually, I'm not sure what approach would be more efficient, but this plan seems to be a good balance.

Wait, I just realized we haven't checked the constraint that "If p1 is in l2_3 (at state s), then p1 must be in l2_5 or p2 must be in l2_4 at or after that state." Since in the initial state, p1 is in l2_3, we need this constraint to hold.

In our plan, we move p2 to l2_4 in steps 3-4. This is good because we satisfy the constraint that "p2 must be in l2_4" when "p1 is in l2_3" (initial state).

but we never brought p1 to l2_5. Let's see if we can further optimize our plan.

Actually, thinking about this more, an even more efficient version would be:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2 (Move t2 to load p2)
2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (Load p2 onto t2)
3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2 (Move p2 to l2_4 - to satisfy Constraint 5)
4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (Unload p2 at l2_4)
5. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2 (Move t2 to load p1)
6. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (Load p1 onto t2)
7. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2 (Move p1 to l2_2 - to satisfy Constraint 2)
8. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (Unload p1 at l2_2)
9. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (Load p1 onto t2 again)
10. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 (Move p1 to l2_1 - to satisfy Constraint 1)
11. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (Unload p1 at l2_1)
12. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2 (Move t2 to load p2)
13. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (Load p2 onto t2)
14. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2 (Move p2 to l2_1 - to satisfy Constraint 6)
15. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (Unload p2 at l2_1)
16. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (Load p1 onto a2)
17. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (Load p2 onto a2)
18. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (Fly a2 to city c1's airport)
19. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (Unload p1 at l1_1)
20. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (Unload p2 at l1_1)
21. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 (Move t1 to load p1 and p2)
22. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (Load p1 onto t1)
23. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (Load p2 onto t1)
24. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1 (Move p1 and p2 to l1_5 - to satisfy Constraints 3 and 7)
25. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 (Unload p1 at l1_5)
26. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 (Unload p2 at l1_5)
27. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 (Load p1 onto t1 again)
28. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 (Load p2 onto t1 again)
29. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1 (Move p1 and p2 to l1_4 - to satisfy Constraint 8 for p2)
30. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (Unload p2 at l1_4)
31. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (Load p2 onto t1 again)
32. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1 (Move p1 to l1_3 and p2 towards l1_1)
33. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (Unload p1 at l1_3 - its final destination)
34. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1 (Move p2 to l1_1)
35. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (Unload p2 at l1_1 - its final destination)

This plan is more efficient as it transports both packages together, leveraging the fact that they have to move through common locations to satisfy their respective constraints.

Actually, we can still squeeze something.

Can we do the air travel in parallel with both p1 and p2 on a2? Let's check the problem statement and make sure that it's allowed to load multiple packages onto an airplane.

The definition of "loadairplane" says "loadairplane p ap l": Load package p in airplane ap. Both p and ap are in location l.

So it seems like the action is defined to load one package at a time. And similarly for "unloadairplane". That's fine, and our revised plan already accounts for that by having separate "loadairplane" actions for p1 and p2. So we can stick with loading both packages onto a2 and transporting them together.

Is there anything else we can do to optimize the plan?

Let's double-check the plan against the constraints:

1. Package p1 must be in location l2_1 at least once. Satisfied in step 11.
2. If p1 is in l2_1, it must have been in l1_1 or l2_2 at an earlier state. Satisfied in step 8.
3. Package p1 must be in location l1_5 at least once. Satisfied in step 25.
4. Package p1 must be in location l2_3 at least once. Satisfied in the initial state.
5. If p1 is in l2_3, then p1 must be in l2_5 or p2 must be in l2_4 at or after that state. Satisfied with p2 in l2_4 in steps 3-4.
6. Package p2 must be in location l2_1 at least once. Satisfied in step 15.
7. If p2 is in l2_1, then p2 must be in l1_5 at or after that state. Satisfied in step 26.
8. Package p2 must be in location l1_4 at least once. Satisfied in step 30.

Ah, I think we took t1 out of its initial location before checking if we can optimize the sequence. Let me revise:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2 (Move t2 to load p2)
2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (Load p2 onto t2)
3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2 (Move p2 to l2_4 - to satisfy Constraint 5)
4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (Unload p2 at l2_4)
5. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2 (Move t2 to load p1)
6. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (Load p1 onto t2)
7. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2 (Move p1 to l2_2 - to satisfy Constraint 2)
8. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (Unload p1 at l2_2)
9. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (Load p1 onto t2 again)
10. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 (Move p1 to l2_1 - to satisfy Constraint 1)
11. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (Unload p1 at l2_1)
12. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2 (Move t2 to load p2)
13. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (Load p2 onto t2)
14. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2 (Move p2 to l2_1 - to satisfy Constraint 6)
15. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (Unload p2 at l2_1)
16. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (Load p1 onto a2)
17. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (Load p2 onto a2)
18. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (Fly a2 to city c1's airport)
19. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (Unload p1 at l1_1)
20. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (Unload p2 at l1_1)
21. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4 (Load p1 onto t1) (t1 is already at l1_4 in the initial state, but p1 is at l1_1, so this is not feasible)

Wait, that doesn't seem right. t1 is at l1_4 and p1 is at l1_1. We can't load p1 onto t1 in l1_4. Let's rethink this:

21. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 (Move t1 to load p1 and p2)
22. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (Load p1 onto t1)
23. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (Load p2 onto t1)
24. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1 (Move p1 and p2 to l1_5 - to satisfy Constraints 3 and 7)
25. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 (Unload p1 at l1_5)
26. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 (Unload p2 at l1_5)
27. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 (Load p1 onto t1 again)
28. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 (Load p2 onto t1 again)
29. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1 (Move p1 and p2 to l1_4 - to satisfy Constraint 8 for p2)
30. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (Unload p2 at l1_4)
31. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (Load p2 onto t1 again)
32. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1 (Move p1 to l1_3 and p2 towards l1_1)
33. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (Unload p1 at l1_3 - its final destination)
34. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1 (Move p2 to l1_1)
35. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (Unload p2 at l1_1 - its final destination)

This seems to be the most optimized plan. Let's ensure the constraints and goal are satisfied with this plan:

1. Package p1 must be in location l2_1 at least once. Satisfied in step 11.
2. If p1 is in l2_1, it must have been in l1_1 or l2_2 at an earlier state. Satisfied in step 8.
3. Package p1 must be in location l1_5 at least once. Satisfied in step 25.
4. Package p1 must be in location l2_3 at least once. Satisfied in the initial state.
5. If p1 is in l2_3, then p1 must be in l2_5 or p2 must be in l2_4 at or after that state. Satisfied with p2 in l2_4 in steps 3-4.
6. Package p2 must be in location l2_1 at least once. Satisfied in step 15.
7. If p2 is in l2_1, then p2 must be in l1_5 at or after that state. Satisfied in step 26.
8. Package p2 must be in location l1_4 at least once. Satisfied in step 30.

At the end, p1 is at l1_3 and p2 is at l1_1, which is our goal.

So, our final optimized plan is (I'll fix a typo in the description of the unloadairplane action):

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2
4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
5. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2
6. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
7. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2
8. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
9. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
10. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
11. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
12. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
13. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
14. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
15. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
16. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
17. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
18. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
19. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
20. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
21. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
22. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
23. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
24. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
25. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
26. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
27. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
28. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
29. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1
30. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
