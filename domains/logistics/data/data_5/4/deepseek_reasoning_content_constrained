Okay, let's try to figure out this planning problem. So, the goal is to get p1 to l2_8 and p2 to l2_1, but there are a bunch of constraints we need to satisfy along the way. Let me start by understanding all the objects and their initial positions.

First, the cities: c1 has locations l1_1 (which is an airport) up to l1_8. c2 has l2_1 (airport) up to l2_8. Trucks t1 and t2 are in l1_8 and l2_4, respectively. Wait, no, wait—the original state says "Package t1 is in location l1_8". Wait, that's a typo, right? Because t1 is a truck, not a package. Maybe the original state meant "Truck t1 is in location l1_8". Similarly for t2. Because otherwise, if t1 is a package, that's conflicting with the problem setup. Hmm, but the problem statement says the world includes "truck t1", "truck t2", so they must be trucks. So maybe there's a mistake in the original state description. Wait, looking back: The original state includes entries like "Package t1 is in location l1_8". That's a problem. Because t1 is a truck. So that's probably a mistake. Wait, maybe it's a typo and should be "Truck t1 is in location l1_8". Otherwise, the problem is impossible because trucks are supposed to carry packages, but if they're packages themselves, that's invalid. So I'll assume that's a typo and the correct initial positions are:

Truck t1 is in l1_8.
Truck t2 is in l2_4.
Similarly, "Package a1 is in location l1_1" — but a1 is an airplane. So that's another typo. Airplanes a1 and a2 should be in their respective airports. So the correct initial state should have:

Airplane a1 is in l1_1 (airport of c1).
Airplane a2 is in l2_1 (airport of c2).
Packages p1 is in l1_4, p2 in l2_2.
So I think the original state has some typos where "Package" is used instead of "Truck" or "Airplane". For example:

Original state entries:
"Package t1 is in location l1_8" → Should be Truck t1.
"Package t2 is in location l2_4" → Truck t2.
"Package a1 is in location l1_1" → Airplane a1.
"Package a2 is in location l2_1" → Airplane a2.

Assuming that, otherwise the problem is impossible. So with that in mind, let's proceed.

The goal is p1 in l2_8 (which is in c2) and p2 in l2_1 (which is the airport of c2). So p2 needs to go from l2_2 to l2_1. That's within the same city, so maybe using a truck. But p1 is in c1's l1_4 and needs to get to c2's l2_8. Since cities are connected via airplanes, which can fly between airports. So p1 would need to be moved from l1_4 to the airport in c1 (l1_1), loaded onto an airplane (a1?), flown to c2's airport (l2_1), then unloaded and transported via truck to l2_8.

But there are constraints to satisfy. Let's list them:

1. At least once, p1 is in l2_1. So during the plan, p1 must pass through l2_1 (which is the airport of c2). That's probably where the airplane unloads it, so that's natural.

2. If p1 is in l2_1 in some state, then p2 must be in l2_8 at that state or later. But the goal is p2 in l2_1. So this seems conflicting unless the plan ensures that after p1 is in l2_1, p2 is moved to l2_8 and then back to l2_1. But the goal requires p2 to be in l2_1, so maybe p2 is first moved to l2_8 and then back. But that complicates things. Wait, the constraint says if p1 is in l2_1 at any state, then p2 must be in l2_8 at that state or after. So after p1 arrives at l2_1, p2 must be moved to l2_8 at some point. But the goal requires p2 to end up in l2_1. So perhaps p2 is first moved to l2_8, then back to l2_1. But how to satisfy that?

3. At least once, p2 is in t2. So p2 must be loaded into t2 at some point.

4. If p2 is in t2 at any state, then later (or at the same time) p2 must be in t1. But t1 is a truck in c1. So this seems tricky because t1 is in c1, and p2 is in c2. Unless we move t1 to c2? No, trucks can't move between cities. They can only move within the same city. So how can p2 be in t1? That's impossible unless there's a way to transfer between trucks via airplanes. Wait, maybe p2 is loaded into t2 in c2, then unloaded, then loaded onto an airplane, flown to c1, loaded into t1. But the goal is for p2 to be in l2_1. So this would require moving p2 back to c2 again, which seems complicated. Hmm. This constraint is challenging.

5. At least once, p1 is in l1_2 or l2_4. So during the plan, p1 must be in one of those locations. l1_2 is in c1, l2_4 is in c2. Since p1 starts in l1_4 (c1), maybe moving it to l1_2 at some point, but that's an extra step. Or maybe after moving to c2, p1 is taken to l2_4. But l2_4 is in c2. So perhaps when transporting p1 via truck in c2, it goes through l2_4.

6. At least once, p2 is in a2 or p1 is in l1_7. a2 is the airplane in c2's airport. So if p2 is loaded into a2, that's one way. Or p1 is moved to l1_7 in c1. But p1's path is from l1_4 to l1_1 (airport) via truck, so unless we take a detour through l1_7, which would add steps.

7. At least once, p2 is in l2_2. But p2 starts there, so that's already true in the initial state. So this constraint is satisfied as long as we don't move p2 before that. But we need to ensure that the initial state counts. Wait, the constraints must hold in at least one state of the plan. So if the initial state has p2 in l2_2, then the first time that's true is the initial state. So that's already satisfied. But the next constraint says, if p2 is in l2_2 in some state s, then p1 must be in a2 at s or after. So since the initial state has p2 in l2_2, the first state (s0) satisfies that. Therefore, we must ensure that in the plan, after s0 (or at s0), p1 is in a2. But p1 starts in l1_4. So how can p1 get into a2 (which is in l2_1, c2)? That would require transporting p1 to c2 and loading it into a2. But a2 is in l2_1, which is c2's airport. So possible: p1 is flown to l2_1 via a1 or a2, then loaded into a2. But why would we do that? Unless a2 is being used to transport p1 again. But the goal is to get p1 to l2_8. So perhaps after unloading p1 from a1 (if a1 flies to l2_1), then load it into a2, then unload again? That seems unnecessary. Alternatively, if a2 is used to carry p1, but why?

This is getting complicated. Let's break down the steps for each package first.

Starting with p1: needs to go from l1_4 (c1) to l2_8 (c2). So possible steps:

1. Use a truck in c1 to move p1 from l1_4 to l1_1 (airport). But which truck? t1 is in l1_8. So need to drive t1 from l1_8 to l1_4, load p1, then drive to l1_1.

So steps:

- Drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_4 c1 (assuming l1_8 and l1_4 are in c1, which they are)
- Loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
- Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
- Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
- Then load p1 into airplane a1 (since a1 is at l1_1)
- Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1
- Unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
- Now, p1 is at l2_1 (c2's airport). Then, to get to l2_8, need a truck in c2. The available truck in c2 is t2, which is initially at l2_4. So drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1, load p1, drive to l2_8, unload.

Wait, but the goal is l2_8 for p1. So steps for p1 after arriving at l2_1:

- Drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2 (but t2 is in l2_4)
- Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (after unloading from airplane)
- Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_8 c2
- Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_8

But wait, t2 is a truck in c2. So that's possible.

For p2: needs to go from l2_2 (c2) to l2_1. Since l2_1 is in c2, same city. So can use truck t2. But t2 is initially at l2_4. So drive t2 to l2_2, load p2, drive to l2_1, unload. That's straightforward.

But there are constraints that complicate this.

Now, let's check the constraints one by one.

Constraint 1: p1 must be in l2_1 at least once. That's satisfied when p1 is unloaded from the airplane at l2_1.

Constraint 2: If p1 is in l2_1, then p2 must be in l2_8 at that state or after. But the goal is p2 in l2_1. So after p1 is in l2_1, p2 must be moved to l2_8, and then back to l2_1. But how? That would require moving p2 from l2_2 to l2_8, then back to l2_1. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the plan can have p2 first go to l2_8, then back to l2_1. Let's think.

But the problem is that the goal requires p2 to end in l2_1, so the final step for p2 is to be in l2_1. So if after p1 is in l2_1 (state S), then p2 must be in l2_8 at S or after. So perhaps after S, we move p2 to l2_8, then back to l2_1.

But how to do that? Let's see.

Suppose after p1 is unloaded at l2_1, we handle p2:

Original plan for p2: drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_2 (to pick up p2), load p2, drive to l2_1, unload. But that would make p2 reach l2_1, which is the goal. However, according to constraint 2, after p1 is in l2_1 (when we unload it from the airplane), we need p2 to be in l2_8 at that state or later. So the initial plan for p2 (direct to l2_1) would violate constraint 2 because after p1 is in l2_1, p2 is moved to l2_1, not l2_8. So we need to adjust.

So perhaps after p1 is in l2_1, p2 must be moved to l2_8 first, then to l2_1. But how?

Let's outline possible steps for p2:

1. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_2 (load p2)
2. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
3. Drive t2 l2_2 to l2_8 (unload p2 here) → satisfies moving to l2_8
4. Then drive t2 from l2_8 to l2_1, load p2 again, drive to l2_1, unload.

But this adds steps. However, this would satisfy constraint 2, because after p1 is in l2_1 (say, at step S), p2 is in l2_8 (step after unloading at l2_8), and then moved back to l2_1.

But this complicates the plan. Let's see if this is necessary.

Constraint 2: If p1 is in l2_1 (which it is after being unloaded from the airplane), then p2 must be in l2_8 at that state or after. So at the moment p1 is in l2_1 (say, after unloading from the airplane), p2 could still be in l2_2. So that state would require that in some subsequent step, p2 is moved to l2_8. So in the plan, after p1 is in l2_1, we need to move p2 to l2_8, then back to l2_1.

But how to do that without making the plan longer?

Alternatively, maybe p2 is moved to l2_8 before p1 arrives in l2_1. But that would violate the constraint because the constraint is triggered when p1 is in l2_1. So the movement of p2 to l2_8 must happen after p1 arrives in l2_1.

So the order would be:

1. Move p1 to l2_1 (triggering constraint 2)
2. Then move p2 to l2_8
3. Then move p2 back to l2_1

But how?

Let me think about the timeline.

For p1:

- Load into t1 in c1, drive to airport l1_1, unload, load into airplane, fly to l2_1, unload. Then load into t2 (in c2), drive to l2_8, unload.

For p2:

- After p1 is in l2_1, load p2 into t2 (but t2 is being used for p1), so perhaps use another truck? Wait, there's only t2 in c2. So maybe:

Wait, in c2, the available truck is t2. So if t2 is used to move p1 to l2_8, then after that, t2 can be used to move p2.

But let's outline:

Steps for p1:

1. Drive t1 from l1_8 to l1_4 (c1)
2. Load p1 into t1 at l1_4
3. Drive t1 to l1_1 (airport)
4. Unload p1 at l1_1
5. Load p1 into airplane a1 at l1_1
6. Fly a1 to l2_1 (c2's airport)
7. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1 → now p1 is in l2_1 (satisfies constraint 1)
8. Now, need to move p1 to l2_8. Use t2:
   - Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1 (if it's not already there)
   - Load p1 into t2 at l2_1
   - Drive t2 to l2_8
   - Unload p1 at l2_8 → goal achieved.

But during this, after step 7 (p1 in l2_1), we need to handle p2.

For p2:

Initially in l2_2. Need to get to l2_1. But constraint 2 says after p1 is in l2_1 (step7), p2 must be in l2_8 at or after that state.

So after step7, we need to:

- Drive t2 (after it's done with p1) to l2_2, load p2, drive to l2_8 (satisfies constraint 2), then drive back to l2_1 and unload.

But t2 is being used for p1 first. So after step8 (unloading p1 at l2_8), t2 is at l2_8. Then:

9. Drive t2 from l2_8 to l2_2 (c2)
10. Load p2 into t2 at l2_2
11. Drive t2 to l2_8 → p2 is now in l2_8 (satisfies constraint 2)
12. Unload p2 at l2_8
13. Then, drive t2 back to l2_1:
14. Drive t2 l2_8 to l2_1
15. Load p2 into t2 at l2_1 (but wait, p2 is at l2_8 now, so need to load it again)
Wait, no. After step12, p2 is in l2_8. To get it to l2_1, we need to load it again into t2:

14. Drive t2 from l2_8 to l2_8 (no, it's already there). Wait, after step12, t2 is at l2_8, p2 is in l2_8.

Wait, after step12: p2 is unloaded at l2_8. So to move it to l2_1, we need to load it again into t2 (which is at l2_8), then drive to l2_1.

So:

13. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_8
14. Drivetruck t2 l2_8 l2_1 c2
15. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 → goal achieved.

But this adds a lot of steps. However, this would satisfy constraint 2, because after p1 is in l2_1 (step7), p2 is moved to l2_8 (step11) and then back to l2_1.

Now, let's check other constraints.

Constraint3: p2 must be in t2 at least once. This happens when we load p2 into t2 in step10 and step13.

Constraint4: If p2 is in t2 (steps10 and13), then later p2 must be in t1. But t1 is in c1. How can p2 get into t1? Since trucks can't move between cities, the only way is to fly p2 to c1, load into t1, but then the goal is for p2 to be in l2_1. So this seems impossible. Therefore, this constraint is a problem.

Wait, constraint4 says if p2 is in t2 at state s, then at s or after, p2 must be in t1. But p2 is in c2, t1 is in c1. So how can p2 get into t1? The only way is to transport p2 to c1 via airplane, load into t1, then transport back. But that's very involved and might make the plan too long.

This is a critical problem. How to satisfy constraint4.

Let's think: Whenever p2 is loaded into t2, we must have p2 in t1 later. So for example, when we load p2 into t2 in step10 (to move to l2_8), we need to ensure that later, p2 is loaded into t1. But t1 is in c1. So p2 would have to be flown to c1, loaded into t1, then flown back to c2. But the goal requires p2 to end up in l2_1. So this would add a lot of steps.

Alternative approach: Find a way to have p2 loaded into t2 and then into t1 without conflicting with the goal.

But how? Let's see.

Alternative plan: Maybe after moving p2 to l2_8, we need to fly it to c1, load into t1, then fly back. But that's complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps we can load p2 into t2, then unload it, then load into an airplane, fly to c1, load into t1, then fly back to c2, unload, and proceed. But this seems very inefficient.

Wait, but maybe there's a different approach. Let's see the constraints again.

Constraint4: If p2 is in t2, then at some point after, p2 is in t1.

So every time p2 is in t2, it must later be in t1. So in our current plan, when we load p2 into t2 in step10 (to move to l2_8), we must have a subsequent step where p2 is in t1. But how?

Possible steps after p2 is in l2_8 (step12):

- Load p2 into airplane a2 at l2_8 (but airplanes can only be at airports. l2_8 is not an airport. So can't load there. So need to move p2 from l2_8 to l2_1 (airport) via truck.

So:

After step12 (p2 in l2_8):

13. Drive t2 from l2_8 to l2_1 (if t2 is at l2_8)
14. Load p2 into t2 at l2_8 (Wait, p2 is already at l2_8. To load into t2, t2 must be there. So step13: drive t2 to l2_8 (but t2 is already at l2_8 after step11). So step13 is redundant.

Wait, after step11: drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_8. Then unload p2 at l2_8 (step12). So t2 is at l2_8. So to move p2 from l2_8 to l2_1 (airport), need to load into t2 again:

13. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_8
14. Drivetruck t2 l2_8 l2_1 c2
15. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 → goal.

But during this, p2 is loaded into t2 (step13), which triggers constraint4: p2 must be in t1 at or after this step. But how?

Alternatively, maybe before moving p2 to l2_8, we first load it into t2 (which triggers constraint4), then move it to l2_8, and then find a way to get p2 into t1. But how?

Alternatively, after loading p2 into t2 (step10), we need to have p2 in t1. So after step10, perhaps:

- Unload p2 from t2 at l2_8 (step12)
- Fly p2 to c1's airport l1_1 using a2 (but a2 is at l2_1). So:

16. Load p2 into a2 at l2_1 (but p2 is at l2_8, need to get it to l2_1 first).

This is getting too complicated. Maybe there's a different way to handle constraint4.

Wait, maybe the initial plan for p2 can involve loading into t2, then moving to the airport, flying to c1, loading into t1, then flying back. But the goal is to have p2 in l2_1. So this would require:

For p2:

1. Load into t2 in l2_2 (triggering constraint4)
2. Drive to l2_1 (airport)
3. Unload, load into airplane (a2)
4. Fly to c1's airport l1_1
5. Unload, load into t1
6. Then, fly back to c2's airport l2_1
7. Unload from airplane, load into t2 again
8. Drive to l2_1 and unload.

But this is very long and seems suboptimal. However, this would satisfy constraint4 because after loading into t2 (step1), p2 is later loaded into t1 (step5). Then, the goal is achieved by step8.

But how does this fit with the other constraints?

Also, need to check the other constraints, like constraint7: if p2 is in l2_2 (which it is initially), then p1 must be in a2 at or after that state. So since the initial state has p2 in l2_2, then p1 must be in a2 at some point after the initial state.

But p1 starts in c1, and a2 is in c2. So p1 must be loaded into a2. To do that, p1 would have to be flown to c2's airport l2_1, then loaded into a2.

So in the plan for p1, after arriving at l2_1 via a1, we need to load p1 into a2, then perhaps fly somewhere else? But the goal is l2_8, so maybe after loading into a2, unload it again (but why?).

Alternatively, after unloading p1 from a1 at l2_1, load it into a2 (which is at l2_1), then unload it again. This would place p1 in l2_1 again, but then we can load it into t2 and drive to l2_8. But this adds steps but satisfies the constraint that after p2 is in l2_2 (initially), p1 is in a2.

So steps for p1 after arriving at l2_1 via a1:

7. Unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
8. Loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (since a2 is at l2_1)
9. Unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (now p1 is back in l2_1)
Then proceed to load into t2 and drive to l2_8.

This way, after the initial state (where p2 is in l2_2), p1 is loaded into a2 (step8), satisfying constraint7.

But this adds steps. However, it's necessary to satisfy the constraint.

Now, putting it all together, considering all constraints:

Plan for p1:

1. Drive t1 from l1_8 to l1_4 (c1)
2. Load p1 into t1 at l1_4
3. Drive t1 to l1_1 (airport)
4. Unload p1 at l1_1
5. Load p1 into a1 at l1_1
6. Fly a1 to l2_1
7. Unload p1 from a1 into l2_1 → constraint1 satisfied
8. Load p1 into a2 at l2_1 → satisfies constraint7 (since p2 is in l2_2 initially, and after this step, p1 is in a2)
9. Unload p1 from a2 into l2_1
10. Load p1 into t2 (assuming t2 is at l2_1)
11. Drive t2 to l2_8
12. Unload p1 at l2_8 → goal achieved.

Plan for p2, considering constraints:

Need to:

- After step7 (p1 in l2_1), p2 must be moved to l2_8 at or after that point.

- Also, constraint4: whenever p2 is in t2, later it must be in t1.

So steps for p2:

Initially in l2_2.

13. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_2 (if not already there; but after step10, t2 is at l2_1. Wait, no. The initial position of t2 is l2_4. So steps for p1 would require t2 to be moved to l2_1. Let's re-examine.

Wait, in the steps for p1, after step9 (unload from a2), we need to load p1 into t2. So t2 must be at l2_1. So initially, t2 is at l2_4. So steps for p1 would require:

- Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1 (c2) before step10.

So inserting:

After step9 (unload p1 from a2 at l2_1):

10. Drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2 (but wait, t2 is initially at l2_4. So before this, in step10, we need to drive t2 to l2_1. However, if we're already using t2 for p1's transport, we need to make sure it's available.

But this is getting complex. Let's reorganize the steps.

Full plan outline:

For p1:

- Move from l1_4 to l1_1 via t1.
- Fly to l2_1 via a1.
- Load into a2 (to satisfy constraint7), then unload.
- Move to l2_8 via t2.

For p2:

- Move from l2_2 to l2_1 via t2, but with detour to l2_8 to satisfy constraint2.
- Also, ensure that whenever p2 is loaded into t2, it's later loaded into t1 (which requires flying to c1).

Let's attempt step-by-step:

1. Drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_4 c1
2. Loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
3. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
4. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
5. Loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
6. Flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
7. Unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 → p1 in l2_1 (constraint1 satisfied)
8. Loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 → now p1 is in a2 (satisfies constraint7)
9. Unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 → p1 back in l2_1
10. Drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2 → move t2 to airport to pick up p1
11. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
12. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_8 c2
13. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_8 → p1 goal achieved

For p2:

Now, after step7 (p1 in l2_1), we need to move p2 to l2_8 (constraint2). Also, need to handle constraint4.

14. Drivetruck t2 l2_8 l2_2 c2 (t2 is at l2_8 after step13, but p2 is at l2_2. So need to move t2 to l2_2 to load p2.)

Wait, but after step13, t2 is at l2_8. So steps for p2:

14. Drivetruck t2 l2_8 l2_2 c2 → move t2 to p2's location
15. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 → now p2 is in t2 (constraint3 satisfied). But this triggers constraint4: must have p2 in t1 later.
16. Drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_8 c2 → move to l2_8
17. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_8 → p2 in l2_8 (satisfies constraint2)
18. Now, to satisfy constraint4, need to get p2 into t1. How?

To do this, we need to move p2 to c1, load into t1.

19. Drivetruck t2 l2_8 l2_1 c2 → move to airport
20. Loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 → load into a2
21. Flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 → fly to c1's airport
22. Unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 → p2 in l1_1
23. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 → load into t1 (constraint4 satisfied)
24. Now, need to return p2 to c2's l2_1 for the goal.

25. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 → p2 back in l1_1
26. Loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 → load into a1
27. Flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 → fly back to c2
28. Unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 → p2 in l2_1 (goal achieved)

But this is extremely lengthy. However, it satisfies all constraints. But is there a shorter way?

Alternative approach: Instead of moving p2 all the way to c1 and back, maybe find a way to load p2 into t1 without moving it. But t1 is in c1, and p2 is in c2. Impossible unless using airplanes.

Alternatively, during the initial movement of p1, could we involve t1 in some way that allows p2 to be loaded into it?

Alternatively, when p2 is in t2 (step15), we need to get it into t1. So after step15, we must load p2 into an airplane, fly to c1, load into t1, then perhaps do nothing else. But the goal requires p2 to be in l2_1. So after loading into t1, we would have to fly back. But this adds steps.

This seems unavoidable. So the plan would be very long.

But the problem asks for an optimal plan, which is the shortest possible. So maybe there's a smarter way.

Wait, let's re-examine constraint4: If p2 is in t2 at any state, then at that state or later, p2 must be in t1. So once p2 is loaded into t2, there must be a subsequent state where p2 is in t1. However, the plan can have p2 in t2 and then later in t1, even if it's not directly related to the goal.

But how to do this with minimal steps.

For example:

When p2 is loaded into t2 (step15), immediately after, unload it, load into an airplane, fly to c1, load into t1, then fly back.

But that's still multiple steps.

Alternatively, after step15 (p2 in t2), we can:

16. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 → p2 back in l2_2
17. Loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (but need to drive t2 to l2_1)
Wait, no. p2 is in l2_2, which is not an airport. So need to move p2 to l2_1 via truck:

16. Drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
17. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 → p2 in l2_1 (goal), but this skips the need to load into t1. But this violates constraint4, because p2 was in t2 (step15), and then in l2_1, but never in t1.

So this won't work.

Alternative idea: After loading p2 into t2 (step15), we drive to l2_1, unload, then load into a2, fly to c1, load into t1, then fly back.

So steps after step15:

16. Drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
17. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 → p2 in l2_1 (goal). But we still need to load into t1.

So after step17, p2 is in l2_1. But to satisfy constraint4, after step15 (p2 in t2), p2 must be in t1 later.

So we need to move p2 from l2_1 to t1. Which requires flying to c1, loading into t1, then perhaps flying back.

But how:

18. Loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
19. Flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
20. Unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
21. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 → now p2 is in t1 (satisfies constraint4)
22. Now, p2 is in t1 in c1. But the goal is to have p2 in l2_1. So need to move it back.

23. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
24. Loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
25. Flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
26. Unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 → goal achieved.

This adds steps 18-26 after step17. This way, after p2 is in t2 (step15), it's later in t1 (step21), satisfying constraint4. But this makes the plan very long. But maybe it's necessary.

However, the problem says to provide an optimal plan, which is the shortest possible. So perhaps there's a way to combine some steps.

Let me see if there's a way to have p2 in t2 and t1 with fewer steps.

Alternatively, maybe during the movement of p1, we can have p2 loaded into t2, then into an airplane, then into t1, but in a way that doesn't require moving back.

But the goal requires p2 to end in l2_1. So after being loaded into t1 in c1, we have to move it back.

This seems unavoidable. So the minimal plan would require these steps.

But this results in a very long plan, which may not be optimal. Perhaps there's a different approach to satisfy the constraints with fewer steps.

Let's re-examine all constraints to see if there's a way to satisfy them with fewer steps.

Constraint6: At least once, p2 is in a2 or p1 is in l1_7. If we can have p1 pass through l1_7, that would satisfy this. For example, when moving p1 from l1_4 to l1_1, perhaps take a route through l1_7. But since trucks can drive between any locations in the city, maybe the drive from l1_4 to l1_1 can go via l1_7. But driving between locations in the same city can be done directly; do we need to specify intermediate steps? No, the drivetruck action can move directly from any location to any other in the same city. So perhaps to satisfy constraint6, we can have p1 in l1_7 during transportation.

For example:

Step3: Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_7 c1
Step4: Drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_1 c1

This would place p1 in l1_7 when t1 is there. Then, p1 is in l1_7 (package is in the truck, but the truck's location is l1_7). So the condition "p1 is in location l1_7" would be true when the truck is there. But the package is in the truck, so technically, the package is in the truck's location. So if the truck is in l1_7, then the package is in l1_7. Because the package is inside the truck, which is in l1_7. So the location of the package is the same as the truck's location when it's loaded.

So by driving t1 through l1_7, we can satisfy constraint6.

This way, we don't have to load p2 into a2, which saves steps. So modifying the plan:

For p1:

1. Drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_4 c1
2. Loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
3. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_7 c1 → p1 is in l1_7 (satisfies constraint6)
4. Drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_1 c1
5. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
6. Loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
7. Flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
8. Unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 → constraint1 met
9. Now, instead of loading into a2, proceed to load into t2:

10. Drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2 → move t2 to airport
11. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
12. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_8 c2
13. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_8 → p1 done

This way, constraint6 is satisfied via step3, so we don't need to load p1 into a2, which was previously done to satisfy constraint7. But constraint7 requires that if p2 is in l2_2 (which it is initially), then p1 must be in a2 at or after that state. Since in the initial state, p2 is in l2_2, we need to ensure that p1 is in a2 at some point after the plan starts.

But in the modified plan, p1 is never loaded into a2. So this violates constraint7. Hence, we must have a step where p1 is in a2.

Thus, the earlier approach of loading p1 into a2 after arriving in l2_1 is necessary to satisfy constraint7.

So combining all the necessary steps, the plan becomes quite long. But perhaps there's a way to optimize.

Alternative approach to satisfy constraint7 without extra steps:

If we can load p1 into a2 when it's already in l2_1, then immediately unload it, but that requires two steps (load and unload). But this would place p1 in a2's location (l2_1), which is the same as before, but at least it satisfies the constraint that p1 is in a2.

So steps after arriving in l2_1:

8. Unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
9. Loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 → p1 in a2
10. Unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 → p1 in l2_1
11. Proceed to load into t2 and drive to l2_8.

This satisfies constraint7 because after the initial state (s0), at step9, p1 is in a2.

Now, for p2's constraints:

After p1 is in l2_1 (step8), p2 must be in l2_8 at or after that.

So p2's movement:

Initially in l2_2.

12. Drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2 → move t2 to p2's location
13. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 → constraint3 met (p2 in t2)
14. Drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_8 c2 → move to l2_8
15. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_8 → satisfies constraint2
16. Now, p2 must be moved to l2_1. Also, after step13 (p2 in t2), must have p2 in t1 later.

So:

17. Drivetruck t2 l2_8 l2_1 c2 → move to airport
18. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 → goal achieved (but p2 is now in l2_1, which is the goal, but we still need to satisfy constraint4: after step13 (p2 in t2), p2 must be in t1 later.

So after step18, p2 is in l2_1. To satisfy constraint4, need to load p2 into t1. But t1 is in c1. So:

19. Loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 → load into a2
20. Flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 → fly to c1's airport
21. Unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 → p2 in l1_1
22. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 → p2 in t1 (constraint4 satisfied)
23. Now, to get p2 back to c2's l2_1:

24. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 → p2 in l1_1
25. Loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 → load into a1
26. Flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 → fly back
27. Unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 → p2 in l2_1 (goal)

But this adds many steps. However, it's necessary to satisfy constraint4.

This seems excessively long. Is there a way to optimize?

Alternative idea: When p2 is loaded into t2 (step13), then immediately fly it to c1 and load into t1, then fly back. But this would require:

After step13:

14. Drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 → move to airport
15. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
16. Loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
17. Flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
18. Unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
19. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 → p2 in t1 (constraint4 satisfied)
20. Now, move p2 back to c2:

21. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
22. Loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
23. Flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
24. Unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 → goal achieved

This way, after step19, p2 is in t1. Then steps 21-24 bring it back to l2_1. However, during this, p2 was moved to l2_1 (step15), then to c1, then back. But this also adds steps.

But the problem requires an optimal (shortest) plan. I'm struggling to find a shorter way. Maybe the constraints can be satisfied in a different order.

Another approach: Since constraint7 requires that if p2 is in l2_2 (which it is initially), then p1 must be in a2 at or after that. The initial state is s0. So if in s0, p2 is in l2_2, we need p1 to be in a2 at some step after s0. The earliest this can happen is when p1 is loaded into a2 in c2's airport.

So perhaps, after p1 is flown to l2_1 (step7), load it into a2 (step8), then unload (step9), and then proceed. This satisfies constraint7.

For constraint4: Whenever p2 is in t2, later it must be in t1. So if we can ensure that p2 is loaded into t2 only once, and then into t1, that's better.

But in the current plan, p2 is loaded into t2 once (step13), and then must be loaded into t1 once.

But to get p2 into t1, we have to move it to c1. So steps 19-24.

But perhaps there's a way to have p2 loaded into t2 and then into t1 without moving it back to c2, but the goal requires it to be in l2_1. So it's unavoidable.

This seems to be the minimal plan, even though it's long. But perhaps there's a way to combine steps.

Wait, after p1 is unloaded at l2_8 (step13), and p2 is unloaded at l2_8 (step15), then both packages are at their required cities. But p2 needs to go back to l2_1. However, the constraints require that p2 be moved to l2_8 after p1 is in l2_1, and then back to l2_1.

But this is the core of the problem. Given the constraints, it's necessary to have these extra steps.

I think given all the constraints, the optimal plan would have to include all these steps. However, I might have missed a smarter way to satisfy multiple constraints with fewer steps.

Another thing to consider: The constraint that p2 must be in l2_2 at least once is already satisfied in the initial state. So that's covered.

Constraint5 requires that p1 is in l1_2 or l2_4. If during the transportation of p1, we route through l1_2, that would satisfy it. For example, when moving p1 from l1_4 to l1_1, drive through l1_2. So:

Modify steps:

1. Drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_4 c1
2. Loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
3. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1 → p1 in l1_2 (satisfies constraint5)
4. Drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
...

This adds one more step but satisfies constraint5.

Similarly, constraint6 can be satisfied by routing through l1_7, but that's another step.

But the problem requires an optimal plan, so maybe combining these.

Wait, if we route the truck through both l1_2 and l1_7, but that's adding two steps. Alternatively, find a path that goes through one of them and satisfies multiple constraints.

Alternatively, perhaps during the initial movement of p1, we can go through l1_2 and l1_7 in the same trip, but I don't think that's possible with the drivetruck action, which moves directly between two locations.

So, given that, the minimal steps would be to take the direct route but make a detour to hit l1_2 or l1_7.

For example, to satisfy constraint5 (p1 in l1_2 or l2_4), we can route p1 through l1_2 when moving to the airport.

So:

1. Drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_4 c1
2. Loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
3. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1 → p1 in l1_2 (constraint5)
4. Drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
...

This adds one step but satisfies constraint5.

Similarly, to satisfy constraint6 (p2 in a2 or p1 in l1_7), if we can have p1 in l1_7 during transportation, but that would require another detour. However, in the current plan, we can't do that without adding steps.

Alternatively, if we route p1 through l1_7 instead of l1_2, then constraint5 would require p1 to be in l2_4. But that's in c2. How would p1 get to l2_4? That's possible after arriving in c2.

So after p1 is in l2_1 (step7), we can drive it to l2_4 (using t2) before moving to l2_8. This would satisfy constraint5 (p1 in l2_4).

So steps for p1:

7. Unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
8. Loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 → satisfy constraint7
9. Unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
10. Drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2 → move t2 to airport
11. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
12. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2 → move to l2_4 (satisfies constraint5)
13. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
14. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
15. Drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_8 c2
16. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_8 → goal achieved

This way, p1 is in l2_4 (step13), satisfying constraint5. This avoids the need to route through l1_2 in c1, saving steps.

This seems better. So using this approach:

For p1:

1. Drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_4 c1
2. Loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
3. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
4. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
5. Loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
6. Flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
7. Unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 → constraint1
8. Loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 → constraint7
9. Unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
10. Drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
11. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
12. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2 → p1 in l2_4 (constraint5)
13. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 → p1 in l2_4
14. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
15. Drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_8 c2
16. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_8 → goal achieved

For p2:

Need to satisfy:

- After p1 is in l2_1 (step7), p2 must be in l2_8.

- Constraint4: whenever p2 is in t2, later in t1.

So steps for p2:

Initially in l2_2.

17. Drivetruck t2 l2_8 l2_2 c2 → after step15, t2 is at l2_8. But we need to move it to l2_2 to load p2.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Let's outline the steps in order.

Wait, after step15, t2 is at l2_8. But for p2's steps, we need to move p2 from l2_2 to l2_8 and then to l2_1. But after p1's steps, t2 is used to move p1, so we need to handle p2 after p1's steps.

But this is becoming very intertwined. Let me try to outline the entire plan in order, considering both packages and constraints.

Final Plan Outline:

1. Drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_4 c1
2. Loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
3. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
4. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
5. Loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
6. Flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
7. Unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 → constraint1 met
8. Loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 → constraint7 met
9. Unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
10. Drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2 → move t2 to airport
11. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
12. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2 → p1 in l2_4 (constraint5)
13. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
14. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
15. Drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_8 c2
16. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_8 → p1 goal achieved

Now, handle p2:

17. Drivetruck t2 l2_8 l2_2 c2 → move t2 to p2's location
18. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 → constraint3 met, triggers constraint4
19. Drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_8 c2 → move to l2_8 (constraint2)
20. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_8
21. Drivetruck t2 l2_8 l2_1 c2 → move to airport
22. Loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
23. Flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
24. Unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
25. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 → constraint4 met (p2 in t1)
26. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
27. Loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
28. Flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
29. Unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 → p2 goal achieved

This plan has 29 steps. It's quite long, but considering all the constraints, it might be necessary. However, there might be a way to optimize steps by reusing airplanes or trucks more efficiently.

For example, after step25, p2 is in t1 (satisfies constraint4). The goal requires p2 to be in l2_1, so steps27-29 are necessary.

But perhaps steps can be merged. For instance, after step20, p2 is in l2_8. Then, steps21-29 are needed to move p2 back to l2_1 and satisfy constraint4.

Alternative idea: After step20 (p2 in l2_8), load p2 into t2, drive to l2_1, unload (goal), and then handle constraint4. But how?

If after step20, p2 is in l2_8, then:

21. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_8
22. Drivetruck t2 l2_8 l2_1 c2
23. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 → goal achieved. But this would leave p2 in t2 until step23. So constraint4 would require that p2 is in t1 after step21 (when p2 is loaded into t2).

But step21 is a load into t2, so after that, p2 must be in t1. So steps24-29 would still be needed.

Hmm. It seems unavoidable.

Given all this, the plan I've outlined satisfies all the constraints and achieves the goal. However, the problem asks for an optimal plan with minimal steps. I'm not sure if there's a shorter way, but given the complexity of the constraints, this might be the optimal solution.
