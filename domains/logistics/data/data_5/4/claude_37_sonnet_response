Let me analyze this problem step by step. I am given a logistics domain where packages need to be transported to specific locations.

**Initial State**:
- Location l1_1 is in city c1 (airport)
- Location l1_2 through l1_8 are in city c1
- Location l2_1 is in city c2 (airport)
- Location l2_2 through l2_8 are in city c2
- Package t1 is in location l1_8 (this seems like a typo, t1 should be a truck, not a package)
- Package t2 is in location l2_4 (this seems like a typo, t2 should be a truck, not a package)
- Package p1 is in location l1_4
- Package p2 is in location l2_2
- Package a1 is in location l1_1 (this seems like a typo, a1 should be an airplane, not a package)
- Package a2 is in location l2_1 (this seems like a typo, a2 should be an airplane, not a package)

I'm going to assume the intended initial state is:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_8
- Truck t2 is in location l2_4
- Package p1 is in location l1_4
- Package p2 is in location l2_2
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

**Goal**:
- Package p1 is in location l2_8
- Package p2 is in location l2_1

**Constraints**:
1. Package p1 must be in location l2_1 at some point
2. After p1 is in location l2_1, p2 must be in location l2_8 at that moment or later
3. Package p2 must be in truck t2 at some point
4. After p2 is in truck t2, p2 must be in truck t1 at that moment or later
5. At some point, p1 must be in location l1_2 or l2_4
6. At some point, p2 must be in airplane a2 or p1 must be in location l1_7
7. Package p2 must be in location l2_2 at some point
8. After p2 is in location l2_2, p1 must be in airplane a2 at that moment or later

Let me think about how to construct a plan that satisfies these constraints and achieves the goal.

First, I need to transport package p1 from l1_4 to l2_8 and package p2 from l2_2 to l2_1.

Constraint 7 says p2 must be in location l2_2 at some point. Looking at the initial state, p2 is already in location l2_2, so this constraint is satisfied from the start.

Constraint 8 says after p2 is in location l2_2, p1 must be in airplane a2. So we need to ensure p1 gets into airplane a2 at some point after the start.

Constraint 1 says p1 must be in location l2_1 at some point. This means p1 needs to go through the airport in city c2.

Constraint 2 says after p1 is in location l2_1, p2 must be in location l2_8 at that moment or later. So we need to move p2 to l2_8 after p1 reaches l2_1.

Constraint 3 says p2 must be in truck t2 at some point.

Constraint 4 says after p2 is in truck t2, p2 must be in truck t1 later. This means p2 needs to be transferred from t2 to t1, which requires moving both trucks to the same location.

Constraint 5 says p1 must be in location l1_2 or l2_4 at some point.

Constraint 6 says p2 must be in airplane a2 or p1 must be in location l1_7 at some point.

Let's sketch a high-level plan:

1. Move p1 from l1_4 to l1_1 (airport) using truck t1
2. Load p1 onto airplane a1
3. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1
4. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1 (satisfying constraint 1)
5. Load p1 onto airplane a2 (satisfying constraint 8 since p2 is already in l2_2)
6. Fly a2 to l1_1
7. Unload p1 from a2
8. Move p1 to l1_7 using truck t1 (satisfying constraint 6)
9. Load p2 onto truck t2 (satisfying constraint 3)
10. Move t2 to l2_1
11. Transfer p2 from t2 to t1 (satisfying constraint 4)
12. Move t2 to l2_8 with p2
13. Unload p2 at l2_8 (satisfying constraint 2)
14. Move p1 to l1_2 or l2_4 (satisfying constraint 5)
15. Finally, move p1 to l2_8 and p2 to l2_1 (achieving the goal)

But wait, there seems to be an issue. If p2 needs to be in truck t1, but t1 is in city c1 and p2 is in city c2, how can we transfer p2 from t2 to t1? Trucks can only move within cities. I need to rethink this.

Actually, to satisfy constraint 4, we need to move p2 between trucks, which means both trucks need to be in the same location. Since trucks can only move within cities, and t1 is in city c1 and t2 is in city c2, we'll need to use airplanes to transport p2 between cities.

Let's revise the plan:

1. Use truck t2 to move p2 from l2_2 to l2_1
2. Load p2 onto airplane a2
3. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1
4. Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1
5. Use truck t1 to pick up p2 from l1_1
6. Use truck t1 to pick up p1 from l1_4
7. Drop p1 at l1_2 (satisfying constraint 5)
8. Move t1 to l1_1 and unload p2
9. Load p2 onto airplane a2
10. Fly a2 back to l2_1
11. Unload p2 from a2
12. Load p2 onto truck t2 (satisfying constraint 3)
13. Move t2 to l2_8
14. Unload p2 at l2_8
15. Move p1 to l1_1 using truck t1
16. Load p1 onto airplane a1
17. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1
18. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1 (satisfying constraint 1)
19. Load p1 onto airplane a2 (satisfying constraint 8)
20. Fly a2 to location that can reach l2_8
21. Unload p1 and use truck t2 to move it to l2_8
22. Use truck t2 to move p2 from l2_8 to l2_1 (achieving the goal)

But this still doesn't satisfy constraint 4, which requires p2 to be in truck t1 after it's in truck t2. Let me revise again.

Actually, I've been overthinking this. Let's approach it differently:

To satisfy constraint 4, we need p2 to be in truck t2 first, and then in truck t1. This means p2 needs to be transferred from city c2 to city c1 at some point, which can only be done via airplanes.

Let's develop the plan step by step, focusing on satisfying each constraint and ultimately achieving the goal.

Initial state:
- p1 is in l1_4
- p2 is in l2_2
- t1 is in l1_8
- t2 is in l2_4
- a1 is in l1_1
- a2 is in l2_1

Goal:
- p1 in l2_8
- p2 in l2_1

Let's start with a plan for p2:
1. Move truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_2
2. Load p2 onto truck t2 (satisfying constraint 3)
3. Move truck t2 to l2_1
4. Unload p2 from truck t2
5. Load p2 onto airplane a2
6. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1
7. Unload p2 from a2 (this also satisfies constraint 6 option 1)
8. Move truck t1 from l1_8 to l1_1
9. Load p2 onto truck t1 (satisfying constraint 4)
10. Move truck t1 back to l1_1
11. Unload p2 from truck t1
12. Load p2 onto airplane a1
13. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1
14. Unload p2 from a1 at l2_1 (achieving goal for p2)

Now for p1:
15. Move truck t1 from l1_1 to l1_4
16. Load p1 onto truck t1
17. Move truck t1 to l1_2 (satisfying constraint 5 option 1)
18. Move truck t1 to l1_7 (satisfying constraint 6 option 2)
19. Move truck t1 to l1_1
20. Unload p1 from truck t1
21. Load p1 onto airplane a1
22. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1
23. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1 (satisfying constraint 1)
24. Load p1 onto airplane a2 (satisfying constraint 8)
25. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l2_1 (no movement)
26. Unload p1 from a2
27. Move truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_8
28. Load p1 onto truck t2
29. Unload p1 from truck t2 at l2_8 (achieving goal for p1)

Wait, I realized something isn't quite right with constraints 2 and 8. Let's reconsider:

Constraint 2 says after p1 is in location l2_1, p2 must be in location l2_8 at that moment or later. This means we need to move p2 to l2_8 after p1 reaches l2_1.

Constraint 8 says after p2 is in location l2_2, p1 must be in airplane a2 at that moment or later. Since p2 starts in l2_2, this means p1 must be in airplane a2 at some point during the execution of the plan.

Let me rethink the ordering of actions:

1. p2 starts in l2_2, so constraint 7 is satisfied
2. This means p1 must get into airplane a2 at some point (constraint 8)
3. p1 must be in location l2_1 at some point (constraint 1)
4. After p1 is in l2_1, p2 must be in l2_8 at that moment or later (constraint 2)
5. p2 must be in truck t2 at some point (constraint 3)
6. After p2 is in truck t2, it must be in truck t1 later (constraint 4)
7. p1 must be in location l1_2 or l2_4 at some point (constraint 5)
8. Either p2 must be in airplane a2 or p1 must be in location l1_7 at some point (constraint 6)

Let's revise the plan again:

1. Move truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_2
2. Load p2 onto truck t2 (satisfying constraint 3)
3. Move truck t2 to l2_1
4. Unload p2 from truck t2
5. Load p2 onto airplane a2
6. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1 (p2 is in a2, satisfying constraint 6 option 1)
7. Unload p2 from a2
8. Move truck t1 from l1_8 to l1_1
9. Load p2 onto truck t1 (satisfying constraint 4)
10. Move truck t1 to l1_4
11. Unload p2 from truck t1
12. Load p1 onto truck t1
13. Move truck t1 to l1_2 (satisfying constraint 5 option 1)
14. Move truck t1 to l1_1
15. Unload p1 from truck t1
16. Load p1 onto airplane a2 (satisfying constraint 8)
17. Fly a2 from l1_1 to l2_1
18. Unload p1 from a2 at l2_1 (satisfying constraint 1)

Now, after p1 is in l2_1, p2 must be in l2_8 at that moment or later (constraint 2):

19. Load p2 onto truck t1
20. Move truck t1 to l1_1
21. Unload p2 from truck t1
22. Load p2 onto airplane a1
23. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1
24. Unload p2 from a1
25. Move truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_8
26. Load p2 onto truck t2
27. Unload p2 from truck t2 at l2_8 (satisfying constraint 2)

Finally, to achieve the goal:

28. Load p1 onto truck t2
29. Move truck t2 to l2_8
30. Unload p1 from truck t2 at l2_8 (achieving goal for p1)
31. Load p2 onto truck t2
32. Move truck t2 to l2_1
33. Unload p2 from truck t2 at l2_1 (achieving goal for p2)

Wait, there's an inconsistency in my plan. I can't have p2 in two places at once. Let me rethink the sequencing to ensure a coherent plan:

Initial state:
- p1 is in l1_4
- p2 is in l2_2
- t1 is in l1_8
- t2 is in l2_4
- a1 is in l1_1
- a2 is in l2_1

1. Move truck t1 from l1_8 to l1_4
2. Load p1 onto truck t1
3. Move truck t1 to l1_2 (satisfying constraint 5 option 1)
4. Move truck t1 to l1_7 (satisfying constraint 6 option 2)
5. Move truck t1 to l1_1
6. Unload p1 from truck t1
7. Move truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_2
8. Load p2 onto truck t2 (satisfying constraint 3 and 7)
9. Move truck t2 to l2_1
10. Unload p2 from truck t2
11. Load p2 onto airplane a2
12. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1
13. Unload p2 from a2
14. Load p1 onto airplane a2 (satisfying constraint 8)
15. Load p2 onto truck t1 (satisfying constraint 4)
16. Move truck t1 to l1_1
17. Unload p2 from truck t1
18. Load p2 onto airplane a1
19. Fly a2 from l1_1 to l2_1
20. Unload p1 from a2 at l2_1 (satisfying constraint 1)
21. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1
22. Unload p2 from a1
23. Move truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_8
24. Load p2 onto truck t2
25. Unload p2 from truck t2 at l2_8 (satisfying constraint 2)
26. Load p1 onto truck t2
27. Move truck t2 to l2_8
28. Unload p1 from truck t2 at l2_8 (achieving goal for p1)
29. Load p2 onto truck t2
30. Move truck t2 to l2_1
31. Unload p2 from truck t2 at l2_1 (achieving goal for p2)

But there's still some inconsistency. Let me break this down differently.

Initial positions:
- p1: l1_4
- p2: l2_2
- t1: l1_8
- t2: l2_4
- a1: l1_1
- a2: l2_1

Goal positions:
- p1: l2_8
- p2: l2_1

Let's first check if constraint 7 is satisfied: p2 must be in location l2_2 at some point. Since p2 starts in l2_2, this constraint is immediately satisfied.

According to constraint 8, after p2 is in l2_2, p1 must be in airplane a2 at that moment or later. So we need to get p1 into airplane a2 at some point.

Let's create a plan:

1. Move truck t1 from l1_8 to l1_4
2. Load p1 onto truck t1
3. Move truck t1 to l1_2 (satisfying constraint 5 option 1)
4. Move truck t1 to l1_7 (satisfying constraint 6 option 2)
5. Move truck t1 to l1_1
6. Unload p1 from truck t1
7. Load p1 onto airplane a2 (satisfying constraint 8)
8. Move truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_2
9. Load p2 onto truck t2 (satisfying constraint 3)
10. Move truck t2 to l2_1
11. Unload p2 from truck t2
12. Load p2 onto airplane a1
13. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1
14. Fly a2 (with p1) from l1_1 to l2_1
15. Unload p1 from a2 at l2_1 (satisfying constraint 1)
16. Load p2 onto truck t2
17. Move truck t2 to l2_8
18. Unload p2 from truck t2 at l2_8 (satisfying constraint 2)
19. Load p2 onto truck t2
20. Move truck t2 to l2_1
21. Unload p2 from truck t2 (achieving goal for p2)
22. Load p1 onto truck t2
23. Move truck t2 to l2_8
24. Unload p1 from truck t2 (achieving goal for p1)

But I need to address constraint 4: After p2 is in truck t2, p2 must be in truck t1 at that moment or later. This is tricky because t1 is in city c1 and t2 is in city c2.

Let me rethink...

Wait, I missed something. In the constraints:
- Constraint 4 says: "After p2 is in truck t2, p2 must be in truck t1 at that moment or later."
- Constraint 6 says: "Either p2 must be in airplane a2 or p1 must be in location l1_7 at some point."

To satisfy constraint 4, p2 must be in truck t2 and then in truck t1. Since trucks are city-bound, this means p2 must be transported between cities using an airplane.

Let's revise again:

1. Move truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_2
2. Load p2 onto truck t2 (satisfying constraint 3)
3. Move truck t2 to l2_1
4. Unload p2 from truck t2
5. Load p2 onto airplane a2 (p2 is in a2, satisfying constraint 6 option 1)
6. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1
7. Unload p2 from a2
8. Move truck t1 from l1_8 to l1_1
9. Load p2 onto truck t1 (satisfying constraint 4)
10. Move truck t1 to l1_4
11. Unload p2 from truck t1
12. Load p1 onto truck t1
13. Move truck t1 to l1_2 (satisfying constraint 5 option 1)
14. Move truck t1 to l1_1
15. Unload p1 from truck t1
16. Load p1 onto airplane a2 (satisfying constraint 8)
17. Load p2 onto airplane a1
18. Fly a2 (with p1) from l1_1 to l2_1
19. Unload p1 from a2 at l2_1 (satisfying constraint 1)
20. Fly a1 (with p2) from l1_1 to l2_1
21. Unload p2 from a1
22. Move truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_8
23. Load p2 onto truck t2
24. Unload p2 from truck t2 at l2_8 (satisfying constraint 2)
25. Load p1 onto truck t2
26. Move truck t2 to l2_8 (no movement needed)
27. Unload p1 from truck t2 at l2_8 (achieving goal for p1)
28. Load p2 onto truck t2
29. Move truck t2 to l2_1
30. Unload p2 from truck t2 at l2_1 (achieving goal for p2)

I think this plan works, but let me double-check for any inconsistencies or unnecessary steps.

Actually, step 26 is unnecessary because t2 is already at l2_8. Also, step 22-24 are redundant with step 25-27. Let me clean this up:

1. Move truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_2
2. Load p2 onto truck t2 (satisfying constraint 3)
3. Move truck t2 to l2_1
4. Unload p2 from truck t2
5. Load p2 onto airplane a2 (p2 is in a2, satisfying constraint 6 option 1)
6. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1
7. Unload p2 from a2
8. Move truck t1 from l1_8 to l1_1
9. Load p2 onto truck t1 (satisfying constraint 4)
10. Move truck t1 to l1_4
11. Unload p2 from truck t1
12. Load p1 onto truck t1
13. Move truck t1 to l1_2 (satisfying constraint 5 option 1)
14. Move truck t1 to l1_1
15. Unload p1 from truck t1
16. Load p1 onto airplane a2 (satisfying constraint 8)
17. Load p2 onto airplane a1
18. Fly a2 (with p1) from l1_1 to l2_1
19. Unload p1 from a2 at l2_1 (satisfying constraint 1)
20. Fly a1 (with p2) from l1_1 to l2_1
21. Unload p2 from a1
22. Move truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_8
23. Load p1 onto truck t2
24. Unload p1 from truck t2 at l2_8 (achieving goal for p1)
25. Load p2 onto truck t2
26. Move truck t2 to l2_1
27. Unload p2 from truck t2 at l2_1 (achieving goal for p2)

But wait, this doesn't satisfy constraint 2 yet, which states: "After p1 is in location l2_1, p2 must be in location l2_8 at that moment or later." 

Let me revise to ensure this sequencing:

1. Move truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_2
2. Load p2 onto truck t2 (satisfying constraint 3)
3. Move truck t2 to l2_1
4. Unload p2 from truck t2
5. Load p2 onto airplane a2 (p2 is in a2, satisfying constraint 6 option 1)
6. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1
7. Unload p2 from a2
8. Move truck t1 from l1_8 to l1_1
9. Load p2 onto truck t1 (satisfying constraint 4)
10. Move truck t1 to l1_4
11. Unload p2 from truck t1
12. Load p1 onto truck t1
13. Move truck t1 to l1_2 (satisfying constraint 5 option 1)
14. Move truck t1 to l1_1
15. Unload p1 from truck t1
16. Load p1 onto airplane a2 (satisfying constraint 8)
17. Load p2 onto airplane a1
18. Fly a2 (with p1) from l1_1 to l2_1
19. Unload p1 from a2 at l2_1 (satisfying constraint 1)

At this point, p1 is in l2_1, so p2 must be in l2_8 at this moment or later (constraint 2):

20. Fly a1 (with p2) from l1_1 to l2_1
21. Unload p2 from a1
22. Move truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_8
23. Load p2 onto truck t2
24. Unload p2 from truck t2 at l2_8 (satisfying constraint 2)

Finally, to achieve the goal:

25. Load p1 onto truck t2
26. Move truck t2 to l2_8 (no movement needed)
27. Unload p1 from truck t2 at l2_8 (achieving goal for p1)
28. Load p2 onto truck t2
29. Move truck t2 to l2_1
30. Unload p2 from truck t2 at l2_1 (achieving goal for p2)

I'm still not convinced that this plan is optimal, or even valid, because there's some confusion in my mind about the logistics. Let me clean it up one more time and make sure each step is coherent:

Initial state:
- p1 is in l1_4
- p2 is in l2_2
- t1 is in l1_8
- t2 is in l2_4
- a1 is in l1_1
- a2 is in l2_1

1. Move truck t1 from l1_8 to l1_4
2. Load p1 onto truck t1
3. Move truck t1 to l1_2 (satisfying constraint 5 option 1)
4. Move truck t1 to l1_1
5. Unload p1 from truck t1
6. Move truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_2
7. Load p2 onto truck t2 (satisfying constraint 3 and 7)
8. Move truck t2 to l2_1
9. Unload p2 from truck t2
10. Load p2 onto airplane a2
11. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1 (p2 is in a2, satisfying constraint 6 option 1)
12. Unload p2 from a2
13. Load p1 onto airplane a2 (satisfying constraint 8)
14. Load p2 onto truck t1 (satisfying constraint 4)
15. Unload p2 from truck t1
16. Load p2 onto airplane a1
17. Fly a2 (with p1) from l1_1 to l2_1
18. Unload p1 from a2 at l2_1 (satisfying constraint 1)
19. Fly a1 (with p2) from l1_1 to l2_1
20. Unload p2 from a1
21. Move truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_8
22. Load p2 onto truck t2
23. Unload p2 from truck t2 at l2_8 (satisfying constraint 2)
24. Load p1 onto truck t2
25. Unload p1 from truck t2 at l2_8 (achieving goal for p1)
26. Load p2 onto truck t2
27. Move truck t2 to l2_1
28. Unload p2 from truck t2 at l2_1 (achieving goal for p2)

But again, there are some inconsistencies. Let me try once more, double-checking each step for validity:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_4 c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
3. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1 (satisfying constraint 5 option 1)
4. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
5. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
6. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2
7. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (satisfying constraint 3 and 7)
8. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
9. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
10. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
11. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (p2 is in a2, satisfying constraint 6 option 1)
12. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
13. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (satisfying constraint 4)
14. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_7 c1
15. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_7
16. drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_1 c1
17. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (satisfying constraint 8)
18. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
19. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
20. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (satisfying constraint 1)
21. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
22. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_8 c2
23. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_8 (achieving goal for p1)
24. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
25. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
26. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_8
27. drivetruck t2 l2_8 l2_1 c2
28. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (achieving goal for p2)

Wait, there's a problem with step 15-16. After unloading p2 from t1 in l1_7, we don't pick it up again before loading it onto a1 in step 18. Let me fix this:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_4 c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

26. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_8 c2
27. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_8 (achieving goal for p1)
28. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_8
29. drivetruck t2 l2_8 l2_1 c2
30. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (achieving goal for p2)

Hmm, I'm still not confident in this plan. Let me check once more that all constraints are satisfied:

- Constraint 1: p1 must be in l2_1 at some point. Satisfied in step 18.
- Constraint 2: After p1 is in l2_1, p2 must be in l2_8 at that moment or later. Satisfied in step 23.
- Constraint 3: p2 must be in t2 at some point. Satisfied in step 7.
- Constraint 4: After p2 is in t2, p2 must be in t1 at that moment or later. Satisfied in step 13.
- Constraint 5: p1 must be in l1_2 or l2_4 at some point. Satisfied in step 3 (p1 in l1_2).
- Constraint 6: Either p2 must be in a2 or p1 must be in l1_7 at some point. Satisfied in step 11 (p2 in a2).
- Constraint 7: p2 must be in l2_2 at some point. Satisfied in step 7 (p2 is loaded from l2_2, so it must be there).
- Constraint 8: After p2 is in l2_2, p1 must be in a2 at that moment or later. Satisfied in step 14.

And the goal is achieved: p1 is in l2_8 (step 27) and p2 is in l2_1 (step 30).

However, I think there are still some inefficiencies in the plan. Let me try to optimize it:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_4 c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
3. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1 (satisfying constraint 5 option 1)
4. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
5. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
6. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2
7. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (satisfying constraint 3 and 7)
8. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
9. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
10. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
11. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (p2 is in a2, satisfying constraint 6 option 1)
12. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
13. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (satisfying constraint 4)
14. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
15. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (satisfying constraint 8)
16. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
17. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
18. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (satisfying constraint 1)
19. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
20. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_8 c2
21. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_8 (achieving goal for p1)
22. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
23. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (achieving goal for p2)

This plan is more efficient and still satisfies all constraints:
- Constraint 1: p1 must be in l2_1 at some point. Satisfied in step 18.
- Constraint 2: After p1 is in l2_1, p2 must be in l2_8 at that moment or later. Wait, this isn't satisfied yet. Let me fix it.

Actually, I need to make sure p2 gets to l2_8 after p1 is in l2_1 (constraint 2):

1. drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_4 c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
3. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1 (satisfying constraint 5 option 1)
4. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
5. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
6. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2
7. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (satisfying constraint 3 and 7)
8. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
9. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
10. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
11. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (p2 is in a2, satisfying constraint 6 option 1)
12. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
13. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (satisfying constraint 4)
14. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
15. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (satisfying constraint 8)
16. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
17. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
18. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (satisfying constraint 1)
19. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
20. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
21. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
22. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_8 c2
23. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_8 (satisfying constraint 2)
24. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
25. drivetruck t2 l2_8 l2_1 c2
26. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_8 c2
27. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_8 (achieving goal for p1)
28. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_8
29. drivetruck t2 l2_8 l2_1 c2
30. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (achieving goal for p2)

But wait, there's an inconsistency. In step 24, p1 is loaded onto t2 in l2_1, but in step 23, t2 is in l2_8. Let me fix that:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_4 c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
3. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1 (satisfying constraint 5 option 1)
4. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
5. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
6. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2
7. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (satisfying constraint 3 and 7)
8. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
9. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
10. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
11. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (p2 is in a2, satisfying constraint 6 option 1)
12. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
13. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (satisfying constraint 4)
14. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
15. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (satisfying constraint 8)
16. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
17. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
18. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (satisfying constraint 1)
19. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
20. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
21. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
22. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
23. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_8 c2
24. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_8 (satisfying constraint 2)
25. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_8 (achieving goal for p1)
26. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_8
27. drivetruck t2 l2_8 l2_1 c2
28. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (achieving goal for p2)

But step 22 is wrong because t2 already has p1 in it from step 19. Let me fix it again:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_4 c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
3. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1 (satisfying constraint 5 option 1)
4. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
5. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
6. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2
7. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (satisfying constraint 3 and 7)
8. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
9. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
10. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
11. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (p2 is in a2, satisfying constraint 6 option 1)
12. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
13. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (satisfying constraint 4)
14. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
15. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (satisfying constraint 8)
16. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
17. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
18. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (satisfying constraint 1)
19. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
20. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
21. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
22. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_8 c2
23. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_8 (achieving goal for p1)
24. drivetruck t2 l2_8 l2_1 c2
25. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
26. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_8 c2
27. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_8 (satisfying constraint 2)
28. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_8
29. drivetruck t2 l2_8 l2_1 c2
30. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (achieving goal for p2)

I think I'm overthinking this. Let me simplify the plan:

Initial positions:
- p1: l1_4
- p2: l2_2
- t1: l1_8
- t2: l2_4
- a1: l1_1
- a2: l2_1

1. drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_4 c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
3. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1 (satisfying constraint 5)
4. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
5. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
6. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2
7. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (satisfying constraint 3 and 7)
8. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
9. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
10. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
11. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (p2 is in a2, satisfying constraint 6)
12. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
13. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (satisfying constraint 4)
14. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
15. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (satisfying constraint 8)
16. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
17. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
18. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (satisfying constraint 1)
19. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
20. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_8 c2
21. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_8 (p1 at goal)
22. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
23. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (p2 at goal) (satisfying constraint 2 because p1 is already in l2_8 from step 21)

This plan still doesn't satisfy constraint 2, which states: "After p1 is in location l2_1, p2 must be in location l2_8 at that moment or later."

Let me try again:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_4 c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
3. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1 (satisfying constraint 5)
4. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
5. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
6. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2
7. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (satisfying constraint 3 and 7)
8. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
9. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
10. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
11. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (p2 is in a2, satisfying constraint 6)
12. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
13. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (satisfying constraint 4)
14. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
15. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (satisfying constraint 8)
16. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
17. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
18. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (satisfying constraint 1)
19. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
20. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
21. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
22. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_8 c2
23. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_8 (satisfying constraint 2)
24. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
25. drivetruck t2 l2_8 l2_1 c2
26. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
27. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
28. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_8 c2
29. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_8 (p1 at goal)
30. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_8
31. drivetruck t2 l2_8 l2_1 c2
32. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (p2 at goal)

Wait, there's a mistake. In step 24, I'm loading p1 onto t2 in l2_1, but p1 should still be in l2_1 from step 18, and t2 should be in l2_8 from step 22. Let me fix this:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_4 c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
3. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1 (satisfying constraint 5)
4. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
5. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
6. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2
7. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (satisfying constraint 3 and 7)
8. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
9. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
10. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
11. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (p2 is in a2, satisfying constraint 6)
12. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
13. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (satisfying constraint 4)
14. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
15. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (satisfying constraint 8)
16. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
17. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
18. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (satisfying constraint 1)
19. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
20. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
21. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
22. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_8 c2
23. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_8 (satisfying constraint 2)
24. drivetruck t2 l2_8 l2_1 c2
25. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
26. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_8 c2
27. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_8 (p1 at goal)
28. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_8
29. drivetruck t2 l2_8 l2_1 c2
30. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (p2 at goal)

I think this plan now satisfies all constraints and achieves the goal. Let me check one more time:

- Constraint 1: p1 must be in l2_1 at some point. Satisfied in step 18.
- Constraint 2: After p1 is in l2_1, p2 must be in l2_8 at that moment or later. Satisfied in step 23.
- Constraint 3: p2 must be in t2 at some point. Satisfied in step 7.
- Constraint 4: After p2 is in t2, p2 must be in t1 at that moment or later. Satisfied in step 13.
- Constraint 5: p1 must be in l1_2 or l2_4 at some point. Satisfied in step 3 (p1 in l1_2).
- Constraint 6: Either p2 must be in a2 or p1 must be in l1_7 at some point. Satisfied in step 11 (p2 in a2).
- Constraint 7: p2 must be in l2_2 at some point. Satisfied as p2 starts in l2_2.
- Constraint 8: After p2 is in l2_2, p1 must be in a2 at that moment or later. Satisfied in step 15.

And the goal is achieved: p1 is in l2_8 (step 27) and p2 is in l2_1 (step 30).

I think this plan is valid and efficient. Let me just review it one more time to make sure all the actions are valid:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_4 c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
3. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1
4. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
5. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
6. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2
7. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
8. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
9. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
10. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
11. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
12. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
13. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
14. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
15. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
16. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
17. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
18. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
19. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
20. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
21. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
22. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_8 c2
23. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_8
24. drivetruck t2 l2_8 l2_1 c2
25. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
26. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_8 c2
27. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_8
28. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_8
29. drivetruck t2 l2_8 l2_1 c2
30. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

All steps look valid to me. This is our final plan.
