Okay, let's try to tackle this planning problem. First, I need to understand the initial state and the goal. The initial state has packages p1 in l1_7, p2 in l1_8, and there are trucks t1 and t2 in cities c1 and c2 respectively. Wait, actually, looking back, the original state says "Package t1 is in location l1_3", but t1 is a truck, right? Wait, the objects listed include "truck t1" and "truck t2". So the original state probably has the trucks in certain locations. Let me check again.

Original state entries:
- "Package t1 is in location l1_3" — Wait, that must be a typo. Because t1 is a truck, not a package. Similarly for "Package t2 is in location l2_5", but t2 is a truck. And "Package a1 is in location l1_1", but a1 is an airplane. Same with a2. So maybe there's a mistake in the problem statement. Or perhaps it's a translation error. Because packages are p1 and p2. So maybe the original state should be:

Wait, the user probably made a mistake here. Let me recheck:

The original state of the world includes:
- "Package t1 is in location l1_3" — but t1 is a truck. That's impossible. Similarly for t2, a1, a2. So this must be an error. Wait, maybe it's a formatting issue. Let's see the exact lines:

Looking at the original state:

"The original state of the world is the following:
	"Location l1_1 is in city c1"
	... (other locations)
	"Package t1 is in location l1_3"
	"Package t2 is in location l2_5"
	"Package p1 is in location l1_7"
	"Package p2 is in location l1_8"
	"Package a1 is in location l1_1"
	"Package a2 is in location l2_1""

Wait, so the user has incorrectly listed trucks and airplanes as packages. Because the objects are:

"truck t1"
"truck t2"
"airplane a1"
"airplane a2"

So the initial state entries for t1, t2, a1, a2 are incorrect. They should not be packages but their respective types. This is a problem. For example, "Package t1 is in location l1_3" is wrong because t1 is a truck, not a package. Similarly for the others. So this seems like an error in the problem statement. But perhaps the user intended that the trucks and airplanes are in those locations. So maybe the correct initial state is:

- Truck t1 is in location l1_3
- Truck t2 is in location l2_5
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1
- Package p1 is in l1_7
- Package p2 is in l1_8

That makes sense. So I need to proceed under the assumption that the problem statement has a typo, and those entries refer to the locations of the trucks and airplanes, not packages. Otherwise, the problem is impossible because trucks can't be packages. So adjusting for that, the initial state is:

Truck t1 is at l1_3 (city c1)
Truck t2 is at l2_5 (city c2)
Airplane a1 is at l1_1 (c1's airport)
Airplane a2 is at l2_1 (c2's airport)
Package p1 is at l1_7 (c1)
Package p2 is at l1_8 (c1)
Wait, but the problem statement says "Package t1 is in location l1_3" which is a truck, so perhaps the user mixed up the terms. So probably, the correct initial positions are:

Truck t1 is in l1_3 (c1)
Truck t2 is in l2_5 (c2)
Airplane a1 is in l1_1 (c1's airport)
Airplane a2 is in l2_1 (c2's airport)
Packages p1 in l1_7 (c1)
Package p2 in l1_8 (c1)

But wait, l1_8 is in city c1, right? Because the locations l1_* are in c1. So the goal is to have p1 in l2_7 (c2) and p2 in l2_1 (c2's airport). 

So the problem is moving p1 from c1 to c2's l2_7, and p2 from c1's l1_8 to c2's l2_1. 

Constraints are a bit complex. Let's list them:

1. At least one state must have p2 in t2.
2. At least one state must have p2 in t1.
3. If p2 is in t1 in some state s, then p1 must be in l2_3 in s or after.
4. At least one state must have p2 in a1.
5. If p2 is in a1 in s, then p2 must be in t2 in s or after.
6. At least one state must have p1 in t1.
7. If p1 is in t1 in s, then p1 must be in a2 in s or after.
8. At least one state must have p1 in a1.
9. If p1 is in a1 in s, then p1 must be in t1 in s or after.

So all these constraints must be satisfied in the plan.

First, let's outline the steps needed to get p1 and p2 to their destinations.

For p1: Starting in l1_7 (c1). Need to get to l2_7 (c2). Since cities are connected by airplanes (airports are in l1_1 and l2_1). So p1 needs to be transported via truck to the airport in c1 (l1_1), loaded onto an airplane, flown to c2's airport (l2_1), then possibly via truck to l2_7. But c2's l2_7 is a location in city c2. So maybe we need a truck in c2 to move it from the airport to l2_7. However, truck t2 is in l2_5 (city c2). So maybe drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (airport), but can trucks move between locations in the same city? Yes, via drivetruck. So t2 can drive from l2_5 to l2_1, then load p1 into t2, then drive to l2_7.

Wait, but p1 is in c1 initially. So steps for p1:

1. Move p1 from l1_7 to l1_1 (airport) using truck t1 (since t1 is in l1_3). So drive t1 to l1_7, load p1, then drive to l1_1. Then load into airplane a1 (which is at l1_1). Fly a1 to l2_1. Then unload p1 at l2_1. Then load p1 into truck t2 (which needs to be driven to l2_1), then drive t2 to l2_7 and unload.

But that's a possible path. Let's check constraints for p1.

Constraints involving p1:

6. At least once, p1 is in t1.

7. If p1 is in t1 in s, then p1 must be in a2 at s or after.

Wait, but a2 is in l2_1 (c2's airport). So if we load p1 into t1 (in c1), then according to constraint 7, p1 must later be in a2. But a2 is in c2. So this would require that after being in t1, p1 is loaded into a2, which is in c2. But that would require moving a2 to c1's airport, but airplanes can't move between cities unless they fly. So a2 is initially in l2_1 (c2). So to get a2 to c1's airport (l1_1), we need to fly it there. But maybe that's possible.

Wait, but airplanes can fly between any airports. So a2 is in l2_1 (c2). We can fly a2 to l1_1 (c1). Then load p1 into a2, fly back to l2_1, then unload. But this complicates the plan. Let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps the plan must involve p1 being in a2. So maybe after loading p1 into t1 (satisfying constraint 6), we then need to get p1 into a2. But how? Because t1 is in c1, and a2 is in c2. So unless we drive t1 to l1_1 (airport), load p1 into a1 (which is at l1_1), fly a1 to l2_1, then unload into a2. Wait, but how would p1 get into a2? Unless we transfer from a1 to a2 at l2_1. But that's possible. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe the constraints require that p1 is loaded into a2 at some point. But given the constraints, perhaps the plan has to include p1 being in a2.

But let's look at constraint 7: If p1 is in t1 in s, then p1 must be in a2 in s or after. So once p1 is loaded into t1, it must later be loaded into a2. So after loading p1 into t1 (in c1), we have to get p1 into a2. But a2 is in c2. So how? We can't drive t1 to c2. So the only way is to fly a2 to c1's airport, then load p1 into a2 from t1 (after driving t1 to l1_1), then fly a2 back to c2. But that would involve additional steps.

Alternatively, perhaps after moving p1 to a1 (c1's airplane), fly a1 to c2, unload, then load into a2. But why would we need to involve a2? Because of constraint 7. Let's see.

Let's outline possible steps for p1:

Option 1:

1. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_7 (load p1 into t1) → satisfies constraint 6 (p1 in t1).

But then, per constraint 7, p1 must be in a2 at s or after. So after loading into t1, we need to get p1 into a2. How?

- Drive t1 to l1_1 (c1's airport), unload p1 into l1_1.

- Load p1 into a1 (since a1 is at l1_1), fly a1 to l2_1 (c2's airport).

- Unload p1 into l2_1. Then load into a2 (which is at l2_1), then fly a2 to some airport (but why?), then unload. But the goal is l2_7. So perhaps after unloading from a1, load into t2 (if t2 is driven to l2_1), then drive to l2_7.

But during this, how does p1 get into a2? Let's say after a1 arrives at l2_1, p1 is unloaded. Then, to satisfy constraint 7, we need to load p1 into a2. But a2 is already at l2_1. So maybe after unloading from a1, load into a2 (but why?), then unload again, then load into t2. That would satisfy constraint 7 (p1 is in a2 after being in t1). But this adds steps. However, this may be necessary to meet the constraints.

But this seems complicated. Let's see if there's another way.

Alternatively, after p1 is in t1 (step 1), drive t1 to l1_1. Then load p1 into a2. But a2 is in l2_1. Wait, how can we load into a2 if it's in another city? Unless we fly a2 to l1_1 first. So steps would be:

- Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.

- Then load p1 into a2 (from t1 at l1_1).

- Then fly a2 back to l2_1.

- Unload p1 into l2_1.

Then, load into t2 and drive to l2_7.

This way, constraint 7 is satisfied: after p1 is in t1 (during step where it's loaded into t1), later it's loaded into a2. So this meets the requirement.

But this adds steps of moving a2 to c1 and back. This might be necessary to meet the constraints.

Similarly, for p2's constraints.

Now, considering all constraints, let's outline the steps.

First, handle p2's constraints:

- Must be in t2 at least once.

- Must be in t1 at least once.

- Must be in a1 at least once.

- When in a1, then must be in t2 later.

So p2 starts in l1_8 (c1). Needs to end up in l2_1 (c2's airport). So possible path: use truck t1 to move p2 to l1_1 (c1's airport), load into a1, fly to l2_1, unload. But since the goal is l2_1, that's straightforward. But constraints complicate this.

But let's see:

Constraints for p2:

1. Must be in t2: but t2 is in c2. So how can p2 get into t2? Because p2 starts in c1. So unless we transport p2 to c2 and then load into t2. So perhaps:

- Move p2 via a1 to c2's airport l2_1.

- Then load into t2 (which is driven to l2_1), then unload into l2_1 (goal). But during this, p2 is in t2, satisfying the first constraint.

But also, need to have p2 in t1. So t1 is in c1. So p2 must be loaded into t1 in c1. For example, initially, p2 is in l1_8. Drive t1 to l1_8, load p2 into t1 (satisfying the constraint that p2 is in t1). Then, per the third constraint, if p2 is in t1 in some state, then p1 must be in l2_3 in that state or after. So after loading p2 into t1, we need to have p1 in l2_3 at some point. But l2_3 is in c2. So p1 must reach l2_3 at some point. But the goal is l2_7. So maybe during p1's transportation, we can have a step where p1 is in l2_3.

But that complicates things. So perhaps after p1 is unloaded in l2_1 (from a1), we load it into t2, drive to l2_3, unload (which would satisfy that condition), then drive to l2_7. So that way, when p2 is in t1 (earlier), later p1 is in l2_3.

So combining all these steps:

Plan outline:

For p2:

1. Load p2 into t1 in c1 (requires driving t1 to l1_8, loadtruck p2 t1 l1_8). This satisfies the constraint that p2 is in t1. Then, per constraint 3, after this, p1 must be in l2_3. So during p1's transport, we need to have p1 in l2_3.

For p2's other constraints:

- Must be in a1. So load p2 into a1 in c1's airport, fly to c2's airport, then unload.

- Also, must be in t2. So after unloading in c2, load into t2, then unload again at l2_1 (but the goal is l2_1, which is an airport, so maybe that's allowed? Or is the goal to have p2 in l2_1 as a location, which is an airport, so unloading from a1 would already put it there. But if we load into t2 and then unload again, that's possible.

But let's think step by step.

For p1:

- Need to get from l1_7 to l2_7.

Steps:

1. Drive t1 to l1_7 (drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_7 c1) → t1 is now in l1_7.

2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_7 → p1 is in t1. This satisfies constraint 6 (p1 in t1). Then, per constraint 7, p1 must later be in a2. So we need to get p1 into a2.

3. Drive t1 to l1_1 (airport): drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_1 c1.

4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 → p1 is now in l1_1.

5. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 → p1 is in a1. This satisfies constraint 8 (p1 in a1). Then per constraint 9, p1 must be in t1 after this. So after loading into a1, we must later load p1 into t1 again. But wait, this complicates because after this, we fly a1 to l2_1. So perhaps:

Wait, constraint 9 says if p1 is in a1 in state s, then p1 must be in t1 in s or after. So after loading into a1 (state s), we must have p1 in t1 after s. But once a1 flies to l2_1 and unloads, p1 is in l2_1. To get p1 into t1 again, t1 must be in l2_1, but t1 is in c1. So this seems impossible. Therefore, the only way to satisfy constraint 9 is to have p1 loaded into a1 and then back into t1 before flying. Which would require:

Wait, this is a problem. Because if we load p1 into a1 (satisfies constraint 8), then we have to have p1 in t1 again after that. But once p1 is in a1, unless we unload it back into t1 in c1, but that would undo the progress. So maybe the plan is:

After step 5 (p1 in a1), unload p1 back into t1. But that would require a1 to be in l1_1, which it is. So:

5. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 → p1 in a1.

6. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 → p1 back in l1_1.

7. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 → p1 in t1 again.

But this seems redundant. But perhaps necessary to meet the constraint. Then, after that, fly a1 to l2_1 with p1, but that's not possible because after unloading, p1 is in t1 again. So this approach may not work.

Alternatively, maybe the constraints can be satisfied in another way. Let me recheck the constraints:

Constraint 9: If p1 is in a1 in state s, then p1 must be in t1 at s or after.

Wait, "at s or after s". So in the same state s, if p1 is in a1, it's okay if it's also in t1. But that's impossible. So the condition is that whenever p1 is in a1 in a state, then in that state or any subsequent state, p1 must be in t1. But once p1 is loaded into a1, it's no longer in t1. So after loading into a1, we must eventually load it back into t1. But that would require unloading from a1 and loading back into t1, which would mean that p1 is back in c1's airport, and then we have to transport it again. Which is inefficient.

This suggests that loading p1 into a1 triggers the need to later load it into t1. But how can we do that after transporting to c2? Because t1 is in c1. So perhaps the only way is to load p1 into a1, fly to c2, unload, then somehow get it back into t1. But t1 is in c1. That's impossible unless we fly t1, which isn't possible. So this seems like a contradiction, meaning that perhaps the initial plan to load p1 into a1 is not allowed unless we can later load it into t1, which is impossible once it's in c2. Therefore, the only way to satisfy constraint 9 is to load p1 into a1 and then immediately unload it back into t1 before flying. But that would mean that the transportation via airplane is not used, which would make the plan impossible.

This suggests that the constraints are interdependent and require careful ordering. Let's think differently.

Perhaps, the plan must involve p1 being loaded into a1, then unloaded into t1 again before flying. But that's not useful. Alternatively, maybe the constraints can be satisfied in a different order.

Wait, let's re-examine constraint 9: If p1 is in a1 in s, then p1 must be in t1 in s or after.

So when we load p1 into a1 (state s1), then in some subsequent state, p1 must be in t1 again. But if after loading into a1, we fly to l2_1 and unload, then how can p1 get back into t1 (which is in c1)? It can't. Therefore, this constraint can only be satisfied if after loading into a1, we unload p1 back into t1 in c1 before flying. But that would require:

1. load p1 into t1 (satisfies constraint 6).

2. drive t1 to l1_1.

3. load into a1 (satisfies constraint 8).

4. unload from a1 back into l1_1.

5. load into t1 again (satisfies constraint 9: after being in a1, it's loaded into t1).

Then fly a1 empty to l2_1? No, because we need to transport p1.

But this approach would require that p1 is loaded into a1, then back into t1, which means the airplane isn't used to transport p1. Which is not helpful. So this seems impossible. Therefore, perhaps the only way to satisfy constraint 9 is to have p1 loaded into a1 after being in t1, fly to c2, then have p1 loaded into t1 again. But since t1 is in c1, this is impossible. So this suggests that the constraints are conflicting, but since the problem states that a valid plan exists, I must have made a mistake in understanding the constraints.

Wait, perhaps constraint 9 says that if p1 is in a1 in some state s, then in s or any state after s, p1 must be in t1. So after loading into a1, we need to have p1 in t1 at some point after. But once p1 is in a1 and flown to c2, it can't be loaded into t1 (in c1) anymore. Therefore, the only way is to load p1 into a1, then unload it into t1 before flying. But that's not possible because once in a1, you can't unload into t1 unless they are in the same location. So:

If we load p1 into a1 at l1_1, then unload it back into l1_1, then load into t1 again. Then fly a1 to l2_1. But then p1 is back in t1 in c1, and we have to start over. This seems like a loop, but maybe it's necessary.

But this is getting too complicated. Let's try to outline a plan that meets all constraints step by step, considering each constraint.

First, let's handle p2's constraints, as they may require specific steps.

p2 needs to be in t1, t2, a1, and after being in a1, must be in t2.

Also, after being in t1, p1 must be in l2_3.

So steps for p2:

1. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_8 (where p2 is).

   drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_8 c1.

2. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_8 → p2 in t1. Satisfies constraint 2 (p2 in t1).

   Now, per constraint 3: after this, p1 must be in l2_3 at or after this state.

   So during p1's transportation, we need to have p1 in l2_3.

3. Then, drive t1 to l1_1 (airport).

   drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_1 c1.

4. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 → p2 in l1_1.

5. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 → p2 in a1. Satisfies constraint 4 (p2 in a1). Then per constraint 5: after this, p2 must be in t2. So after this, p2 must be loaded into t2.

6. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1.

7. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 → p2 in l2_1 (goal achieved for p2). But we need to load p2 into t2 to satisfy constraint 5. So:

8. drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1.

   drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2.

9. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 → p2 in t2 (satisfies constraint 1).

10. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 → p2 back in l2_1 (which is the goal).

This way, after step 5 (p2 in a1), steps 9 and 10 ensure p2 is in t2, satisfying constraint 5.

Now for p1:

p1 needs to end up in l2_7. Also, constraints:

6. p1 must be in t1 at least once.

7. If p1 is in t1, then later in a2.

8. p1 must be in a1 at least once.

9. If p1 is in a1, then later in t1.

But as earlier, this seems conflicting. Let's try:

For p1:

1. Drive t1 to l1_7 (after handling p2's steps 1-4, but need to see the order).

Wait, t1 is used for both p1 and p2. So the steps must be interleaved.

Let me outline the entire plan with both packages:

Overall steps:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_8 c1 (to pick up p2).

2. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_8 → p2 in t1 (constraint 2).

3. drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_7 c1 (to pick up p1).

   Now, t1 is in l1_7.

4. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_7 → p1 in t1 (constraint 6).

5. Now, per constraint 7: after this, p1 must be in a2.

   So need to load p1 into a2. But a2 is in l2_1. So steps:

   a. Drive t1 to l1_1.

      drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_1 c1.

   b. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 → p1 in l1_1.

   c. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 → p1 in a1 (constraint 8).

      Now, per constraint 9: after this, p1 must be in t1.

      But a1 is at l1_1. To get p1 back into t1, we need to unload from a1 and load into t1 again.

   d. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 → p1 in l1_1.

   e. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 → p1 in t1 again. Now, constraint 9 is satisfied.

   f. Now, to satisfy constraint 7 (p1 in a2 after being in t1), we need to load p1 into a2.

      But a2 is in l2_1. So steps:

      i. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (assuming a1 is empty now).

      ii. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

      iii. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 → p1 in a2.

      iv. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1.

      v. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 → p1 in l2_1.

      vi. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (after driving t2 to l2_1).

      vii. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_7 c2.

      viii. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_7.

   This seems very lengthy and may not be optimal. Let's see if there's a better way.

Alternatively, after step 5 (p1 in a1), per constraint 9, we must have p1 in t1 again. So steps 5d and 5e as above. Then, after p1 is back in t1, per constraint 7, we must load into a2. So:

   f. drive t1 to l1_1 (already there).

   g. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 → but a2 is in l2_1. So first need to fly a2 to l1_1.

      So:

      i. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

      ii. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 → p1 in a2.

      iii. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1.

      iv. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 → p1 in l2_1.

      v. drive t2 to l2_1, load, and drive to l2_7.

This adds several steps. But perhaps necessary.

Now, considering the constraint 3: after p2 is in t1 (step 2), p1 must be in l2_3 at or after that state. So after step 2, in some later step, p1 must be in l2_3. But according to the current plan, p1 ends up in l2_7. So we need to have p1 in l2_3 at some point. This can be done by, after unloading p1 in l2_1 (step v), load into t2, drive to l2_3, unload, then drive to l2_7.

So modifying steps:

v. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 → p1 in l2_1.

vi. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 (step 8 from earlier).

vii. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 → p1 in t2.

viii. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2 → move to l2_3.

ix. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 → p1 in l2_3 (satisfies constraint 3).

x. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_7 c2 → move to l2_7.

xi. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_7 → goal achieved.

This would satisfy the requirement that after p2 is in t1 (step 2), p1 is in l2_3 at step ix.

But this adds more steps. This is getting quite complex. Let's try to put it all together.

Final plan steps (order matters, need to interleave actions for both packages):

1. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_8 c1 (move t1 to p2's location).

2. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_8 (p2 in t1).

3. drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_7 c1 (move t1 to p1's location).

4. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_7 (p1 in t1, satisfying constraint 6).

5. drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_1 c1 (move t1 to airport).

6. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (p2 in l1_1).

7. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (p2 in a1, satisfying constraint 4).

8. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (move a1 to c2's airport).

9. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (p2 in l2_1, which is the goal. But need to load into t2 to satisfy constraint 5.

10. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 (move t2 to airport).

11. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (p2 in t2, satisfying constraint 1 and 5).

12. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (p2 back in l2_1, which is the goal).

Now, for p1's steps after step 5:

After step 5, t1 is at l1_1 with p1.

13. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (p1 in l1_1).

14. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (but a1 is at l2_1 now. Wait, after step 8, a1 is at l2_1. So we can't load into a1 here. Oops, mistake.

This is a problem. Because step 8 moves a1 to l2_1. So after step 8, a1 is no longer in l1_1. So steps 7-8 are for p2. Then, when trying to handle p1, we need to use a different airplane.

Wait, initially, a1 is in l1_1, a2 is in l2_1.

After step 8, a1 is in l2_1. So to load p1 into a1, we need to fly a1 back to l1_1, but that would take more steps.

Alternatively, use airplane a2 for p1.

Let me re-plan:

After step 9, p2 is unloaded in l2_1.

Now, handle p1's transportation:

After step 5, t1 is at l1_1 with p1.

6. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (p1 in l1_1).

7. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (but a1 is in l1_1 until step 8. So steps 6-7 must happen before step 8.

Wait, this is getting tangled. Let's re-order the steps correctly.

Correct order:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_8 c1.

2. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_8.

3. drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_7 c1.

4. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_7.

5. drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_1 c1.

6. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

7. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1.

8. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1.

9. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1.

10. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2.

11. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.

12. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.

Now, for p1:

After step 5, t1 is at l1_1 with p1.

13. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (p1 in l1_1).

14. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (but a1 is at l1_1 before step 8. So step 14 must be before step 8.

Wait, this is conflicting because steps 7 and 14 both involve a1. Let me re-express the correct order.

Here's the problem: steps 1-5 involve moving t1 to l1_1 with both p2 and p1. Wait, no. Step 3: after step 2, t1 is at l1_8, then driven to l1_7 (step 3), loaded with p1 (step4), then driven to l1_1 (step5). So when t1 arrives at l1_1, it has both p2 and p1?

No, because after step 2, t1 is loaded with p2. Then driven to l1_7 (step3), then loaded with p1 (step4). So t1 would have both p2 and p1? But trucks can carry multiple packages, I assume. So yes, after step4, t1 contains p2 and p1.

Then, when driven to l1_1 (step5), both packages are in t1. Then, in step6, unload p2. So p2 is unloaded into l1_1. Then step7 loads p2 into a1. Then step8 flies a1 to l2_1.

Meanwhile, p1 is still in t1 at l1_1. Then:

After step6, p1 is still in t1. Then, step7 loads p2 into a1. Then step8 flies a1 to l2_1. Then step9 unloads p2.

Now, to handle p1:

13. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (p1 in l1_1).

14. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 → but a1 is in l2_1 after step8. So this is impossible. Therefore, we need to load p1 into a1 before step8.

So steps must be:

After step5 (t1 at l1_1 with p2 and p1):

6. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (p2 in l1_1).

7. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (p2 in a1).

8. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (p1 in l1_1).

9. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (p1 in a1).

10. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (both p2 and p1 are in a1).

11. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1.

12. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1.

Now, p1 is in l2_1. Then, load into t2 and drive to l2_7.

But this way, loading p1 into a1 (step9) satisfies constraint8. Then per constraint9, p1 must be in t1 after this. But after step9, p1 is in a1. When a1 flies to l2_1, and unloads p1 into l2_1, there's no way to get p1 back into t1 (in c1). Therefore, this violates constraint9.

This indicates a problem. Hence, this approach won't work.

Alternative approach: Use a2 for p1's transportation.

After step5, t1 is at l1_1 with p1.

6. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1.

7. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 → but a2 is in l2_1. So first need to fly a2 to l1_1.

So:

7. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

8. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1.

9. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1.

10. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1.

Then, load into t2 and drive to l2_7.

This way, loading p1 into a2 (step8) satisfies constraint7 (after being in t1, p1 is in a2). Also, when p1 is in a1 (earlier steps?), no. But constraint8 requires p1 to be in a1 at least once. So we need to find a way to load p1 into a1.

But if we use a2 for p1's transport, then p1 is never in a1, which violates constraint8. So this is a problem.

Therefore, we must use a1 for p1's transport to satisfy constraint8.

But this brings us back to the earlier problem of constraint9.

So perhaps the only way is to have p1 loaded into a1, then unloaded into t1 again before flying. But how?

Let's try:

For p1:

1. Drive t1 to l1_7, load p1.

2. Drive to l1_1.

3. unload p1 into l1_1.

4. load into a1 (satisfies constraint8).

5. unload from a1 back into l1_1.

6. load into t1 again (satisfies constraint9).

7. Now, fly a1 empty to l2_1.

8. fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.

9. load p1 into a2.

10. fly a2 to l2_1.

11. unload p1 into l2_1.

12. load into t2 and drive to l2_7.

But this way, p1 is in a1 (step4), then unloaded back into t1 (steps5-6), satisfying constraint9. Then, p1 is loaded into a2 (step9), satisfying constraint7 (after being in t1, p1 is in a2).

But this requires multiple flights for a2, which adds steps. But this might be necessary.

Integrating all steps:

Plan steps:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_8 c1.

2. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_8.

3. drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_7 c1.

4. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_7.

5. drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_1 c1.

6. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

7. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1.

8. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1.

9. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1.

10. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2.

11. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.

12. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.

Now, p2's part is done.

For p1:

13. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1.

14. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1.

15. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1.

16. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1.

Now, to satisfy constraint7, after step4 (p1 in t1), p1 must be in a2. So:

17. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

18. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1.

19. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1.

20. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1.

21. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1.

22. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_7 c2.

23. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_7.

But during this, when does p1 get into a1? Step14 loads p1 into a1, which satisfies constraint8. Then, in step15, it's unloaded back into l1_1. Then loaded into t1 (step16), satisfying constraint9. Then, loaded into a2 (step18), which satisfies constraint7.

But this plan has many steps. Is it optimal? It's possible, but the problem asks for an optimal (shortest) plan.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to combine steps to minimize actions.

Alternative idea: Use a1 to transport p2 and p1 in the same flight.

But first, let's count the steps in the above plan. Steps 1-23, which is too long. Probably not optimal.

Alternative approach:

Let me try to find a more optimal path.

For p2:

- t1 picks up p2, drives to l1_1, loads into a1, fly to l2_1, unload. Then, load into t2 and unload to meet constraints.

For p1:

- t1 picks up p1, drives to l1_1, loads into a1, fly to l2_1, unload. Then, load into t2 and drive to l2_7.

But this would involve:

For p2:

1. Drive t1 to l1_8, load p2.

2. Drive to l1_1, unload p2.

3. Load p2 into a1.

4. Fly a1 to l2_1.

5. Unload p2.

6. Drive t2 to l2_1, load p2, unload.

For p1:

7. Drive t1 to l1_7, load p1.

8. Drive to l1_1, unload p1.

9. Load p1 into a1.

10. Fly a1 to l2_1.

11. Unload p1.

12. Load into t2, drive to l2_7.

But this would require two separate flights for a1, which is not efficient. Alternatively, carry both packages in one flight.

But the problem is the constraints for p1 require that after being in a1, it must be in t1 again, which is impossible once flown to c2.

So perhaps, after loading p1 into a1 (satisfies constraint8), then fly a1 to c2, unload, and then load into t2. But per constraint9, after being in a1, p1 must be in t1. Which is impossible. So this approach violates constraint9.

Thus, the only way to satisfy all constraints is to have p1 loaded into a1, then unloaded back into t1 in c1 before flying.

This requires:

For p1:

1. Load into t1.

2. Drive to l1_1.

3. Unload.

4. Load into a1.

5. Unload back into l1_1.

6. Load into t1 again.

Then, fly a2 to c1's airport, load p1 into a2, fly to c2, unload, load into t2, drive to l2_7.

This way:

- p1 is in t1 (steps1 and6) → satisfies constraint6.

- p1 is in a1 (step4) → satisfies constraint8.

- After being in a1 (step4), p1 is loaded into t1 again (step6) → satisfies constraint9.

- After being in t1 (steps1 and6), p1 is loaded into a2 (later step) → satisfies constraint7.

So steps for p1:

a. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_7.

b. drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_1 c1.

c. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1.

d. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1.

e. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1.

f. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1.

g. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

h. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1.

i. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1.

j. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1.

k. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2.

l. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1.

m. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_7 c2.

n. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_7.

This way, all constraints for p1 are met.

But this adds many steps. Combining with p2's steps:

Overall plan:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_8 c1.

2. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_8.

3. drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_7 c1.

4. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_7.

5. drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_1 c1.

6. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

7. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1.

8. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1.

9. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1.

10. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2.

11. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.

12. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.

Now, for p1:

13. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1.

14. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1.

15. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1.

16. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1.

17. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

18. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1.

19. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1.

20. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1.

21. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1.

22. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_7 c2.

23. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_7.

Additionally, after step4 (p1 in t1), to satisfy constraint7, p1 must be in a2 later. Which is achieved in step18.

Also, after step14 (p1 in a1), step16 loads into t1, satisfying constraint9.

But this plan has 23 steps. Is there a way to shorten this?

For example, combine steps where possible.

For example, after step5, t1 is at l1_1 with p2 and p1.

6. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

7. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1.

8. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1.

9. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1.

10. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1.

11. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2.

12. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.

13. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.

For p1:

14. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1.

15. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1.

16. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1.

17. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

18. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1.

19. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1.

20. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1.

21. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1.

22. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_7 c2.

23. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_7.

This is still 23 steps. 

But perhaps some steps can be merged. For example, when unloading both packages from t1 at l1_1 in steps6 and7.

Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way to handle the constraints.

Another idea: Since p2 must be in t1 and t2, and p1 must be in t1 and a2, perhaps using t1 to transport both packages part of the way.

But this is getting too time-consuming. Given the complexity, I'll proceed to outline a plan that meets all constraints, even if it's lengthy.
