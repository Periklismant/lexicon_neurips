**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Move p1 to l1_3:** Load p1 into t1 at l1_4, drive to l1_3, and unload. This satisfies the constraint that if p1 is in l2_1 later, there was a previous state where p1 was in l1_3.

2. **Move p2 to l1_3:** Load p2 into t1 at l1_4, drive to l1_3, and unload. This ensures whenever p1 was in l1_4 (initially), p2 is in l1_3 afterward.

3. **Transport p2 to l1_1:** Load p2 into t1 at l1_3, drive to l1_1 (airport), and unload. This prepares p2 for air transport.

4. **Load/Unload p2 with a1:** Load p2 into airplane a1 at l1_1 and immediately unload. This satisfies the constraint that p2 must be in an airplane (a1) at some state.

5. **Transport p1 to l1_1:** Load p1 into t1 at l1_3, drive to l1_1, and unload. This positions p1 for air transport to c2.

6. **Fly p1 to c2:** Load p1 into a1, fly to l2_1 (c2's airport), and unload. Now p1 is in l2_1.

7. **Load/Unload p1 with a2:** Load p1 into a2 at l2_1 and unload. This satisfies the constraint that p1 must be in a2.

8. **Final Transport of p1:** Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1, load p1, drive to l2_5, and unload. This achieves p1's goal.

9. **Final Transport of p2:** Load p2 into t1 at l1_1, drive to l1_5, and unload. This achieves p2's goal after passing through l1_1 earlier.

This plan ensures all constraints are met with the minimal necessary steps.
