Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. Hmm, the goal is to get p1 to l2_4 and p2 to l2_1, right? And there are a bunch of constraints to satisfy. Let's start by understanding the initial state and the required conditions.

First, the initial state. The packages: p1 and p2 are both in l2_2, which is in city c2. Trucks t1 is in l1_3 (city c1), t2 in l2_5 (city c2). Airplanes a1 is in l1_1 (airport of c1), a2 in l2_1 (airport of c2). The goal is p1 in l2_4 and p2 in l2_1.

Constraints to satisfy:

1. At some state, p2 must be in l2_4. But the final goal has p2 in l2_1. So p2 needs to go to l2_4 first and then be moved to l2_1. Wait, but how? Because l2_4 is in c2, so maybe via truck t2. But t2 is in l2_5 initially. So maybe drive t2 to l2_4, load p2, then drive back?

2. At some state, p1 must be in a1. a1 is in c1's airport l1_1. So p1 needs to be loaded onto a1. But p1 starts in c2. So we need to transport p1 from c2 to c1. That would require using an airplane. Wait, but airplanes can only move between airports. So maybe take p1 from l2_2 to l2_1 (airport) via truck, load onto a2 (since a2 is in l2_1), fly a2 to l1_1, unload p1, then load onto a1? Or maybe use a different airplane. Wait, a1 is in c1's airport, a2 in c2's. So to get p1 from c2 to c1, we need to fly it via a2 to l1_1, then transfer to a1?

But the constraint is that p1 must be in a1 at some point. So perhaps after moving p1 to l1_1 via a2, then load it into a1. Then fly a1 back to c2? Wait, but the goal is to have p1 in l2_4, which is in c2. So maybe after getting p1 into a1, fly a1 to l2_1 (c2's airport), then unload and use a truck to take it to l2_4.

Another constraint: if p2 is in l2_1 (the goal), there must be an earlier state where p1 is in l1_3 or l2_3. But initially, p1 is in l2_2. So maybe p1 has to pass through l2_3 on its way? Or perhaps l1_3. Wait, l1_3 is in c1. How would p1 get there? If we transport p1 to c1 via airplane, then maybe via truck to l1_3. But that seems like a detour, but maybe necessary for the constraint. So when we move p1 from c2 to c1, perhaps we first bring it to l1_3, then load into t1, drive to the airport, load onto a1, then fly back to c2. Hmm, not sure. This needs to be thought through carefully.

Another constraint: p1 must be in l2_2 at some state. Well, initially, it's already there. So that's satisfied. Wait, but the initial state is part of the plan's states. So the first state (the initial state) already has p1 in l2_2, so that's one constraint checked off. Then, if in any state after that, when p1 is in l2_2 again, we have to ensure that either p2 is in l1_4 or l2_3 at that state or later. But since p1 starts in l2_2, maybe that's the state where the constraint is applied. So we need to ensure that after that initial state, p2 is moved to either l1_4 or l2_3. But l1_4 is in c1, which is a different city. So moving p2 to l1_4 would require transporting it via airplane. That might complicate things. Alternatively, moving p2 to l2_3 (in c2) which is possible via truck t2, since t2 starts in l2_5. So maybe drive t2 to l2_2, load p2, drive to l2_3, unload. Then that satisfies the condition. But since the initial state already has p1 in l2_2, maybe we need to ensure that after that, p2 is moved to one of those places. So perhaps in the plan, after the initial state, we first move p2 to l2_3, which satisfies the constraint when p1 is in l2_2 (the initial state) and then p2 is in l2_3 in a later state.

Another constraint: p2 must be in l2_2 at some state. Initially, it is, so that's satisfied. But then when that's true (in the initial state), the constraint requires that either p1 is in l1_2 or p2 is in l1_3 at that state or later. Since in the initial state, p1 is in l2_2 and p2 is in l2_2. So for the initial state, the condition would require that in some subsequent state, p1 is in l1_2 or p2 in l1_3. Since p1 needs to end up in l2_4, maybe moving p2 to l1_3 would require transporting it to c1. But that's more steps. Alternatively, moving p1 to l1_2. But p1 is in c2. So this seems conflicting. Wait, maybe the initial state's p2 in l2_2 counts, and we need to ensure that after that, either p1 is moved to l1_2 or p2 is moved to l1_3. Since p1 starts in l2_2, which is in c2. To get p1 to l1_2 (c1), we'd need to fly it via airplane. That might be part of the plan. But this is getting complicated.

So, putting this all together, here's a possible approach:

For p1's journey:

1. From l2_2 (c2) to l2_1 (airport of c2) via truck t2. Wait, but t2 is in l2_5. So first, drive t2 to l2_2, load p1, drive to l2_1. Then load into a2 (airplane), fly to l1_1 (c1's airport), unload p1. Then load into a1 (since a1 is in l1_1), then fly a1 back to l2_1. Then unload p1, load into truck t2, drive to l2_4. But this would make p1 in a1 at some point (when loaded into a1), satisfying that constraint. Then fly a1 to l2_1, unload, then drive to l2_4.

For p2's journey:

Need to get to l2_1. But also, at some point, p2 must be in l2_4. So perhaps first move p2 to l2_4, then to l2_1. So, using truck t2: drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2 (but p2 is already there?), wait, initial location of p2 is l2_2. So perhaps drive t2 to l2_2, load p2, drive to l2_4 (if possible). Then unload p2 there (satisfies the constraint that p2 is in l2_4). Then, from l2_4, drive to l2_1 (but l2_1 is in c2, so can t2 drive there? l2_1 is an airport, and the city is c2. The truck can drive between any locations in c2, so yes. So drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1, unload p2. That would get p2 to l2_1, meeting the goal.

But wait, in the initial state, p2 is in l2_2. So to move it to l2_4: drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2 (load p2), then drive to l2_4 (unload). Then, drive t2 to l2_1 (unload there). But maybe t2 is needed for both p1 and p2. Hmm, conflicting use. So perhaps we need to sequence these actions properly.

Wait, but in the initial state, t2 is in l2_5. So for p2, which is in l2_2, we need a truck in l2_2 to load it. So maybe use another truck? The objects include t1 and t2. t1 is in l1_3 (c1), which is in a different city. So t2 is the only truck in c2. So t2 must be driven from l2_5 to l2_2 to load p2. Then drive to l2_4 (unload), then drive to l2_1 (unload again). But then, for p1, we need to use the same truck to move it from l2_2 to l2_1. But p1 is also in l2_2 initially. So maybe the sequence would be:

First, drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2 (takes time). Then load p2 into t2, drive to l2_4, unload (satisfies constraint), then drive t2 back to l2_2, load p1, drive to l2_1, unload p1. Then load p1 into a2, fly to l1_1. Then load into a1, fly back to l2_1, unload p1 into t2 again, drive to l2_4. But this seems like a lot of steps.

Alternatively, for p1: use a different approach. Since the goal is to have p1 in l2_4 (c2), maybe it's better to not move p1 out of c2. But the constraint requires that p1 is in a1 (which is in c1). So p1 has to be transported to c1, loaded into a1, then flown back to c2. So steps for p1:

1. Move p1 from l2_2 to l2_1 (airport) using truck t2. To do that, drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2 (load p1), then drive to l2_1. Unload p1 at l2_1. Then load p1 into airplane a2 (since a2 is at l2_1). Fly a2 to l1_1 (c1's airport). Unload p1. Then load p1 into a1 (since a1 is at l1_1). Now, p1 is in a1, satisfying the constraint. Then fly a1 to l2_1 (since airplanes can fly between airports). Unload p1, load into truck t2 (which is at l2_1 now), drive to l2_4, unload. That gets p1 to the goal.

For p2:

Need to get to l2_1, but also must pass through l2_4. So, drive t2 (after handling p1) to l2_2 (but t2 is at l2_1 after handling p1). Wait, this is conflicting. Let's think again.

Wait, initial steps for p1:

1. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2. (Action: drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2)
2. Load p1 into t2. (loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2)
3. Drive t2 to l2_1. (drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2)
4. Unload p1. (unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1)
5. Load p1 into a2. (loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1)
6. Fly a2 to l1_1. (flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1)
7. Unload p1. (unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1)
8. Load p1 into a1. (loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1) --> This satisfies the "p1 is in a1" constraint.
9. Fly a1 to l2_1. (flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1)
10. Unload p1. (unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1)
11. Load p1 into t2 (if t2 is at l2_1). But after step 3, t2 is at l2_1. Then after step 3, step 4 is unloading, so t2 remains at l2_1. Then steps 5-10 involve a2 and a1. So after step 10, p1 is in l2_1. Then load into t2 (if t2 is there). But where is t2? After step 3, t2 is at l2_1. Then step 4 unloads p1. So t2 is still at l2_1. So step 11: loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1. Then drive to l2_4. Then unload. That would get p1 to l2_4.

But during this time, handling p2:

After handling p1 up to step 3 (t2 is at l2_1 with p1 unloaded), maybe we can use t2 to move p2. But p2 is at l2_2. So maybe after moving p1 to l2_1, drive t2 back to l2_2 to pick up p2. Let's see.

Wait, but the steps for p1 would be:

1. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2. (t2 now in l2_2)
2. Load p1 into t2. (p1 in t2)
3. Drive t2 to l2_1. (t2 now in l2_1)
4. Unload p1. (p1 in l2_1)
5. Now, to handle p2, we need to drive t2 back to l2_2. So step 5: drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2.
6. Load p2 into t2. (loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2)
7. Drive to l2_4. (drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2)
8. Unload p2. (now p2 is in l2_4, satisfying that constraint)
9. Then drive t2 to l2_1. (drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2)
10. Unload p2. (p2 is in l2_1, which is the goal)

But inserting these steps into the plan would require interleaving with the p1 steps. Let's see:

Order of actions:

- For p1: steps 1-4 (get p1 to l2_1)
- For p2: steps 5-10 (but steps 5 is driving t2 back to l2_2, which is after step 3 (t2 is at l2_1)
But after step 4 (unload p1), t2 is still at l2_1. So step 5: drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2. Then load p2, drive to l2_4, unload, then drive to l2_1.

But then, after handling p2, we need to continue with p1's steps. After step 10 (unload p2 at l2_1), then proceed with p1's steps 5-11:

5. Load p1 into a2 (but p1 is in l2_1 now, and a2 is at l2_1 initially). Wait, but a2 is in l2_1 initially. So after step 4 (unload p1 at l2_1), p1 is in l2_1, a2 is there. So load p1 into a2 (loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1), then fly to l1_1.

But wait, the initial state says "Package a1 is in location l1_1" and "Package a2 is in location l2_1". Wait, no, wait the original state says:

Wait, the original state mentions:

"Package a1 is in location l1_1"

Wait, that's probably a typo. Because a1 is an airplane. Oh wait, looking back:

The original state says:

"Package t1 is in location l1_3"

"Package t2 is in location l2_5"

"Package p1 is in location l2_2"

"Package p2 is in location l2_2"

"Package a1 is in location l1_1"

"Package a2 is in location l2_1"

Wait, that's incorrect. Because t1, t2 are trucks, a1, a2 are airplanes, and p1, p2 are packages. So the original state probably has:

"Truck t1 is in location l1_3"

"Truck t2 is in location l2_5"

"Airplane a1 is in location l1_1"

"Airplane a2 is in location l2_1"

But the user input has:

The original state of the world is the following:

	"Location l1_1 is in city c1"

	"Location l1_2 is in city c1"

	... 

	"Package t1 is in location l1_3"

	"Package t2 is in location l2_5"

	"Package p1 is in location l2_2"

	"Package p2 is in location l2_2"

	"Package a1 is in location l1_1"

	"Package a2 is in location l2_1"

Wait, this is a problem. Because the user has incorrectly listed trucks and airplanes as packages. For example, "Package t1 is in..." which should be Truck t1. Similarly for airplanes. This is a critical mistake. But since the user provided this, we have to work with it. So according to the problem statement, t1, t2, a1, a2 are packages, which can't be right. But that's impossible because the actions involve trucks and airplanes as separate entities. So this must be a typo in the problem statement. Probably, the correct original state should be:

"Truck t1 is in location l1_3"

"Truck t2 is in location l2_5"

"Airplane a1 is in location l1_1"

"Airplane a2 is in location l2_1"

But given that the user wrote "Package t1", etc., but the available actions involve trucks and airplanes, this is a contradiction. But since the user is providing this as the problem, we have to assume that this is a mistake and that t1, t2 are trucks, a1, a2 are airplanes. Otherwise, the problem is unsolvable. So perhaps it's a formatting error, and we should proceed under the assumption that "t1" is a truck in l1_3, "t2" is a truck in l2_5, "a1" is an airplane in l1_1, and "a2" is an airplane in l2_1. Otherwise, the actions can't be performed.

Assuming that, let's proceed.

So initial locations:

- Trucks: t1 in l1_3 (c1), t2 in l2_5 (c2)
- Airplanes: a1 in l1_1 (c1's airport), a2 in l2_1 (c2's airport)
- Packages: p1 and p2 in l2_2 (c2)

Goal: p1 in l2_4 (c2), p2 in l2_1 (c2)

Constraints:

1. p2 must be in l2_4 at some state.
2. p1 must be in a1 at some state.
3. p2 must be in l2_1 at some state (which is the goal).
4. If p2 is in l2_1 (goal), there must be an earlier state where p1 is in l1_3 or l2_3.
5. p1 must be in l2_2 at some state (already true initially).
6. If p1 is in l2_2 (which it is initially), then p2 must be in l1_4 or l2_3 at that state or later.
7. p2 must be in l2_2 at some state (already true initially).
8. If p2 is in l2_2 (initially), then p1 must be in l1_2 or p2 in l1_3 at that state or later.

So let's address each constraint:

- Constraint 5 and 7 are already satisfied in the initial state.

- For constraint 8: since p2 is in l2_2 initially, we need that in some state after, either p1 is in l1_2 or p2 is in l1_3. Since p1 is in l2_2 initially, we need to move one of them. To satisfy this, perhaps move p2 to l1_3. But that's in c1. So p2 would need to be transported to c1. But p2's goal is in c2. Alternatively, move p1 to l1_2. But p1 is in c2. So moving p1 to l1_2 (c1) would require flying it to c1. Which might be part of the plan. Let's see.

But how to satisfy constraint 8. Since the initial state has p2 in l2_2, after that, we need to ensure that either p1 is moved to l1_2 or p2 is moved to l1_3. Let's say we move p1 to l1_2 as part of its journey. For example, after transporting p1 to c1's airport (l1_1), drive it via truck t1 to l1_2. Then unload. That would satisfy the condition. But would that interfere with the plan? Let's see.

So steps for p1:

1. Use truck t2 in c2 to move p1 from l2_2 to l2_1 (airport).

   - Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2 (c2)
   - Load p1 into t2.
   - Drive t2 to l2_1.
   - Unload p1.

2. Load p1 into airplane a2 at l2_1.

3. Fly a2 to l1_1 (c1's airport).

4. Unload p1 into l1_1.

5. Load p1 into truck t1 (which is in l1_3). To do that, drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1 (since airports are in cities, and t1 can drive within c1). But wait, in c1, the locations include l1_1 (airport), l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5. So t1 is in l1_3. So drive t1 to l1_1, load p1, then drive to l1_2, unload. This would satisfy the constraint that p1 is in l1_2, which is needed for constraint 8.

But this seems like a detour. Alternatively, after unloading p1 in l1_1, load into airplane a1 (which is in l1_1), fly to l2_1. But then, when is p1 loaded into a1? If we load p1 into a1 in l1_1, then fly to l2_1, then unload, that satisfies the constraint that p1 is in a1 (step when loaded into a1). Then unload into l2_1, load into truck t2, drive to l2_4.

But during this process, after moving p1 to l1_1, we could drive t1 to l1_1, load p1 into t1, drive to l1_2, unload. Then p1 is in l1_2, satisfying constraint 8. Then reload into t1, drive back to l1_1, load into a1, fly to l2_1. But this adds steps. However, perhaps necessary to meet constraints.

Alternatively, maybe after p1 is in a1 (loaded), fly to l2_1, unload, then move via truck to l2_4. But during the flight, p1 is in a1, satisfying constraint 2.

But need to check all constraints.

Let's try to outline a plan step by step, considering all constraints.

Plan outline:

For p1:

1. Move from l2_2 to l2_1 via truck t2.

Actions:

- drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2 (t2 is in l2_5 initially)
- loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
- drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
- unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

2. Load p1 into a2 and fly to c1's airport l1_1.

- loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
- flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
- unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

3. Load p1 into a1 (to satisfy constraint 2).

- loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

4. Fly a1 to l2_1.

- flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
- unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

5. Load p1 into t2 and drive to l2_4.

- loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
- drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
- unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

For p2:

1. Move from l2_2 to l2_4 via truck t2 (after t2 has moved p1 to l2_1 and returns).

But t2 is used for p1 first. After step 1 (moving p1 to l2_1), t2 is at l2_1. Then, after unloading p1, we need to move t2 back to l2_2 to pick up p2.

Actions:

- drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
- loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
- drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2
- unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (satisfies constraint 1)
- drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
- unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (goal)

But inserting these steps into the plan requires that after moving p1 to l2_1 and before handling p1's flight to c1, we handle p2. But that's not possible because once t2 is used to move p2, it's in l2_4. But p1's journey to c1 requires using a2, which is in l2_1. So perhaps after moving p1 to l2_1, we first handle p2's movement to l2_4 and back to l2_1, then proceed with p1's flight.

But let's see the order:

Plan steps:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2 (t2 moves to p1's location)
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 (t2 brings p1 to airport)
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (p1 is at l2_1)
5. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2 (t2 returns to pick up p2)
6. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
7. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2
8. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (constraint 1 met)
9. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2 (t2 brings p2 to l2_1)
10. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (p2 goal met)
11. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (now p1 is loaded into a2)
12. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
13. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (p1 in l1_1)
14. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (constraint 2 met)
15. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
16. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
17. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (t2 is now at l2_1 after step 9)
18. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
19. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (p1 goal met)

But wait, after step 10, p2 is already at l2_1 (goal). But then steps 17-19 are moving p1 to l2_4. However, in this plan, after step 10, p2 is already at the goal, but we still need to move p1. However, step 17 uses t2 which is at l2_1 (after step 9 and 10). But after step 10, t2 is at l2_1. So step 17 is possible.

But this plan has a problem: steps 11-19 (moving p1 via a2 and a1) happen after p2 is already delivered. But in step 11, p1 is loaded into a2, but p1 was unloaded at l2_1 in step 4. So steps 11-19 would need to happen after step 4 but before step 5. Because after step 4, t2 is at l2_1, and step 5 moves t2 back to l2_2. But the above order is incorrect because steps 5-10 are for p2, which occur after step 4. Then steps 11-19 are after p2 is delivered. But in that case, p1 is still at l2_1 (from step 4) and needs to be moved to l2_4. But according to this plan, after step 4, p1 is in l2_1. Then steps 5-10 move p2. Then steps 11-19 move p1 via a2 and a1. But this would mean that after step 19, p1 is in l2_4, which is the goal.

However, this plan may not be optimal and may have some issues with the order of actions.

Let's check the constraints:

- Constraint 1: p2 is in l2_4 at step 8. Satisfied.

- Constraint 2: p1 is in a1 at step 14. Satisfied.

- Constraint 3: p2 is in l2_1 at step 10. Satisfied.

- Constraint 4: If p2 is in l2_1 (step 10), there must be an earlier state where p1 is in l1_3 or l2_3. However, in this plan, p1 is in l2_1 (step 4), then in a2 (step 11), then in l1_1 (step 13), then in a1 (14), etc. So nowhere in this plan is p1 in l1_3 or l2_3. Thus, this violates constraint 4. Therefore, this plan is invalid.

Ah, right. So we need to ensure that before p2 reaches l2_1 (step 10), there's a state where p1 is in l1_3 or l2_3.

But in the current plan, p1 is never in those locations. So how to fix this.

Alternative approach: Have p1 pass through l2_3 or l1_3. But p1 starts in l2_2. To get to l2_3, it's easy: use truck t2 to drive from l2_2 to l2_3. But why would p1 go there? Let's see.

Suppose during p1's journey to l2_1, we make a detour via l2_3. For example:

1. Move p1 from l2_2 to l2_3 via t2.

But initially, t2 is in l2_5. So drive t2 to l2_2, load p1, drive to l2_3, unload. Then drive t2 to l2_1, load p1 again, etc. But that adds steps.

But this would satisfy constraint 4, because p1 would be in l2_3 before p2 is in l2_1.

So let's adjust the plan:

Plan steps:

For p1:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2 (p1 is now in l2_3, satisfying constraint 4 when p2 reaches l2_1)
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (p1 is in l2_3)
5. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2 (now t2 is at l2_1)
6. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (p1 is loaded again)
7. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2 (deliver p1 to goal)
8. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

But this skips the airplane part needed to load p1 into a1. So need to integrate that.

Alternatively, after step 4 (p1 in l2_3), use another method to get p1 into a1.

But how? Since a1 is in l1_1 (c1's airport). To get p1 to a1, it needs to be flown from c2 to c1. So:

After step 4 (p1 in l2_3), load p1 into t2, drive to l2_1, unload, load into a2, fly to l1_1, load into a1.

But steps:

4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (p1 in l2_3)
5. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
6. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (p1 loaded into t2 at l2_1)
7. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (p1 at l2_1)
8. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
9. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
10. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
11. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (constraint 2 met)
12. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
13. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
14. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
15. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
16. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

For p2:

After step 5 (t2 is at l2_1), need to move p2 from l2_2 to l2_4 and then to l2_1.

But how?

Maybe after step 5, drive t2 to l2_2 to load p2:

17. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
18. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
19. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2
20. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (constraint 1)
21. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
22. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (goal)

But inserting these steps after step 5 would interfere with p1's steps. Because steps 6-16 are for p1, and steps 17-22 for p2. But this would require t2 to be used for both packages, leading to conflicts.

Alternatively, interleave the steps:

But this is getting complex. Let's try to outline a valid plan step by step, ensuring all constraints.

Plan Steps:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2 (move t2 to p1's location)
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2 (move p1 to l2_3 to satisfy constraint 4)
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (p1 in l2_3)
5. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2 (move t2 to airport)
6. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (reload p1)
7. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (p1 at l2_1)
8. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
9. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
10. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
11. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (p1 in a1, constraint 2 met)
12. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
13. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
14. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
15. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
16. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (p1 goal met)

For p2:

17. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2 (after delivering p1, t2 returns to l2_2)
18. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
19. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2
20. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (constraint 1)
21. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
22. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (p2 goal met)

But in this plan, after step 4, p1 is in l2_3. Then steps 5-7 move t2 back to l2_1 and p1 is there. But step 4 is the only time p1 is in l2_3, which satisfies constraint 4 (since p2 is unloaded at l2_1 in step 22, which happens after step 4, so there's an earlier state where p1 is in l2_3). Also, when p2 is in l2_1 (step 22), the earlier state (step 4) has p1 in l2_3. So constraint 4 is satisfied.

Other constraints:

- constraint 6: When p1 is in l2_2 (initially), we need p2 to be in l1_4 or l2_3 in some state after. In this plan, p2 is moved to l2_4 (step 20) and then to l2_1. So after the initial state, p2 is moved to l2_4 (step 20), which is not l1_4 or l2_3. So this violates constraint 6. Thus, this plan is invalid.

Ah, right. So we need to ensure that after the initial state (where p1 is in l2_2), p2 is moved to l1_4 or l2_3 at some state. But in the current plan, p2 is moved to l2_4. So we need to adjust that.

To satisfy constraint 6: p2 must be in l1_4 or l2_3 after the initial state. Since l1_4 is in c1, moving p2 there would require using an airplane. Let's consider moving p2 to l2_3.

So, after moving p1 to l2_3 (step 4), perhaps use truck t2 to move p2 to l2_3.

But p2 is in l2_2. So steps:

After step 4 (p1 in l2_3), t2 is in l2_3. Then, drive t2 to l2_2 to pick up p2.

But steps:

4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
5. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2 (t2 moves to p2's location)
6. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
7. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2 (move p2 to l2_3)
8. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (now p2 is in l2_3, satisfying constraint 6)
9. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2 (t2 moves to airport)
10. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (but p1 is in l2_3 at step 4. Wait, no, in this scenario, after step 4, p1 is in l2_3. So steps after step 8 would involve moving p1 again.

This is getting too complicated. Let's try to re-plan.

Alternative approach:

Ensure that after the initial state (p1 in l2_2), p2 is moved to l2_3.

Steps:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (now p2 is in l2_3, satisfying constraint 6)

Then proceed to handle p1.

But then p1 is still in l2_2. So:

5. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (but t2 is at l2_3 after step 3. So need to drive back.

Wait, after step 3, t2 is at l2_3. To load p1 (which is in l2_2), t2 needs to be there.

So:

5. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2
6. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
7. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2 (p1 is moved to l2_3)
8. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (constraint 4 is satisfied when p2 reaches l2_1)
9. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
10. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
11. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
12. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
13. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
14. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
15. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (constraint 2)
16. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
17. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
18. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
19. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
20. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (p1 goal)

For p2:

After step 4, p2 is in l2_3. Then, need to move to l2_4 and then to l2_1.

21. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2 (after step 20, t2 is at l2_4. But step 20 is after p1 is delivered. So maybe after step 20, drive t2 back to l2_3 to pick up p2.)

But this seems too late. Alternatively, after step 4, p2 is in l2_3. Need to move to l2_4 to satisfy constraint 1.

So:

21. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2 (after step 4, but t2 is used for p1's steps. This is conflicting.)

This is getting too tangled. Perhaps the optimal plan requires multiple uses of the truck and airplanes, interleaving steps for both packages while satisfying all constraints.

Given the complexity, perhaps the optimal plan is as follows, but I need to ensure all constraints are met:

1. Move t2 to l2_2, load p1 and p2, drive to l2_3 (satisfies constraint 6 for p2 in l2_3 and constraint 8 for p1 in l2_2 leading to p2 in l2_3).

Wait, but trucks can only carry one package at a time, unless the actions allow loading multiple. The problem statement doesn't mention that, so we assume each load/unload is per package. So perhaps need to handle p1 and p2 separately.

Let's try this step-by-step:

Action 1: drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2

Action 2: loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

Action 3: drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2 (p1 is moved to l2_3, which satisfies the later constraint 4)

Action 4: unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

Action 5: drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2

Action 6: loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

Action 7: drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2 (p2 now in l2_3, satisfying constraint 6)

Action 8: unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3

Action 9: drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2 (move t2 to airport)

Action 10: loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (but p1 is at l2_3. Wait, no, p1 is in l2_3, unloaded from t2 in action 4. So to move p1 to the airport, need to load it again.

But this requires moving t2 back to l2_3. Which is possible.

Action 9: drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2 (empty)

Action 10: drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2 (back to l2_3)

Action 11: loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

Action 12: drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

Action 13: unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

Action 14: loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

Action 15: flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

Action 16: unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

Action 17: loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (constraint 2 met)

Action 18: flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

Action 19: unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

Action 20: loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

Action 21: drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2

Action 22: unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (p1 goal)

For p2:

After action 8, p2 is in l2_3. Need to move to l2_4 then l2_1.

Action 23: drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2 (after action 22, t2 is at l2_4. So drive back to l2_3.)

Action 24: loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3

Action 25: drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2

Action 26: unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (constraint 1 met)

Action 27: drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2

Action 28: unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (p2 goal)

But this plan has many steps and may not be optimal. Also, the constraints regarding the order must be checked.

Constraint 4: If p2 is in l2_1 (action 28), there's an earlier state where p1 is in l2_3 (action 4). Yes.

Constraint 6: After initial state (p1 in l2_2), p2 is in l2_3 (action 8). Satisfied.

Constraint 8: When p2 is in l2_2 (initially), the constraint requires p1 in l1_2 or p2 in l1_3 in some state. In this plan, p2 is moved to l2_3 (action 8), so that's satisfied.

Other constraints:

- p2 in l2_4 (action 26): yes.

- p1 in a1 (action 17): yes.

- p2 in l2_1 (action 28): yes.

- p1 in l2_2 (initially): yes.

- p2 in l2_2 (initially): yes.

- For constraint that when p1 is in l2_2 (initial state), then p2 must be in l1_4 or l2_3 after. Since p2 is moved to l2_3 in action 8, which is after the initial state, this is satisfied.

- When p2 is in l2_2 (initial state), the constraint requires p1 in l1_2 or p2 in l1_3. But in this plan, p2 is moved to l2_3, which is in c2, not l1_3. So p2 in l2_3 is not l1_3, so this constraint is violated.

Wait, no. The constraint says that if p2 is in l2_2 in some state s, then in s or later, either p1 is in l1_2 or p2 is in l1_3. The initial state has p2 in l2_2, so in the initial state s, we need that in s or later, either p1 is in l1_2 or p2 is in l1_3. In this plan, p2 is moved to l2_3 (c2), which is not l1_3 (c1). So this constraint is not satisfied. So this plan is invalid.

Ah, right. So to satisfy that, when p2 is in l2_2 (initial state), we need that in some state after, either p1 is in l1_2 (c1) or p2 is in l1_3 (c1). But in this plan, p2 is moved to l2_3 (c2), which doesn't satisfy the constraint. So we need to either move p1 to l1_2 or move p2 to l1_3.

Moving p2 to l1_3 would require transporting it to c1. So steps to load p2 into a2, fly to l1_1, then drive to l1_3. But this is a detour, but necessary.

Let's adjust the plan to include moving p2 to l1_3.

Revised plan steps:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 (move p2 to airport)
4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
5. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
6. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (c1's airport)
7. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
8. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1 (move truck t1 to airport)
9. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
10. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
11. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (p2 in l1_3, satisfying constraint)
12. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
13. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
14. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
15. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (optional, but not needed. Alternatively, move p2 back to a2.)
16. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (assuming a1 is here)
17. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
18. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (p2 goal)

But this is getting very long. However, this would satisfy the constraint that when p2 is in l2_2 (initial state), later p2 is in l1_3.

But this is adding many steps. The optimal plan likely requires fewer steps, but given the constraints, it's necessary.

This is quite complex. Given time constraints, I'll try to present a plan that meets all constraints, even if it's not the shortest possible.

Final plan outline:

Actions for p2:

- Move p2 from l2_2 to l2_1 via truck t2, fly to l1_1, drive to l1_3, then fly back.

But this might be necessary to satisfy constraints.

However, this seems too long. Let's try to find a shorter plan.

Alternative approach for constraint 8:

Ensure that p1 is moved to l1_2.

Steps:

1. Move p1 to l2_1 via truck t2.
2. Fly to l1_1 via a2.
3. Drive to l1_2 via t1, then back to l1_1.
4. Fly back to l2_1 via a1.
5. Deliver to l2_4.

This would require:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
5. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
6. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
7. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
8. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
9. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
10. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
11. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 (constraint 8 met)
12. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
13. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
14. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
15. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (constraint 2 met)
16. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
17. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
18. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
19. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
20. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

For p2:

21. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2
22. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
23. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2
24. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (constraint 1)
25. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
26. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (goal)

But this plan ensures:

- p1 is in l1_2 (step 11), satisfying constraint 8.

- p2 is in l2_4 (step 24).

- p1 in a1 (step 15).

- p2 in l2_1 (step 26), and before that, p1 was in l1_2 (step 11), satisfying constraint 4.

- After initial state (p1 in l2_2), p2 is moved to l2_4, which is not l1_4 or l2_3. So constraint 6 is not satisfied. Thus, invalid.

Ah, this is the problem. To satisfy constraint 6, after the initial state (p1 in l2_2), p2 must be moved to l1_4 or l2_3. So moving p2 to l2_4 doesn't help. So we need to adjust.

Alternative for p2: move to l2_3.

Steps:

21. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2 (after delivering p1)
22. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
23. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2 (p2 in l2_3)
24. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (constraint 6 met)
25. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
26. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (goal)

This way, after the initial state, p2 is moved to l2_3 (step 24), satisfying constraint 6.

But this would require steps 21-26 after p1's steps.

So the full plan would be:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
5. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
6. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
7. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
8. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
9. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
10. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
11. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 (constraint 8 met)
12. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
13. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
14. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
15. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (constraint 2 met)
16. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
17. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
18. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
19. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
20. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (p1 goal)
21. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2
22. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
23. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
24. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (constraint 6 met)
25. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
26. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (p2 goal)

Now check all constraints:

- Constraint 1: p2 in l2_3 (step 24) no, wait, constraint 1 requires p2 in l2_4. Oh no! Mistake. The constraint 1 says p2 must be in l2_4 at some state. So in this plan, p2 is moved to l2_3, not l2_4. Thus, constraint 1 is not met.

Ah, this is a problem. So to satisfy constraint 1, p2 must be in l2_4. So the plan must include moving p2 to l2_4.

So revising steps 21-26:

21. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2
22. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
23. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2
24. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (constraint 1 met)
25. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
26. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (goal)

But then, after the initial state, p2 is moved to l2_4, which doesn't satisfy constraint 6 (needs l1_4 or l2_3). So this plan violates constraint 6.

Thus, this approach won't work. The only way to satisfy both constraint 1 and 6 is to move p2 to l2_4 and to either l1_4 or l2_3. But this requires multiple moves.

Alternative approach for p2:

- Move p2 from l2_2 to l2_3 (satisfy constraint 6), then to l2_4 (constraint 1), then to l2_1 (goal).

Steps:

For p2:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (constraint 6 met)
5. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
6. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (constraint 1 met)
7. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
8. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (goal)

But then, this sequence for p2 would need to be integrated with p1's steps, which are using t2.

So interleaving steps:

Plan:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2 (move t2 to p1 and p2's location)
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 (move p1 to airport)
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
5. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
6. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
7. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
8. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1 (move t1 to airport)
9. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
10. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1 (p1 in l1_2, satisfying constraint 8)
11. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
12. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
13. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
14. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
15. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (constraint 2 met)
16. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
17. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
18. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
19. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
20. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (p1 goal)

For p2:

21. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2 (after delivering p1)
22. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
23. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
24. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (constraint 6 met)
25. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
26. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (constraint 1 met)
27. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
28. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (goal)

But this plan includes steps 21-28 after p1 is delivered, which uses t2 again. However, after step 20, t2 is at l2_4, so step 21 is drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2.

This plan now satisfies:

- constraint 1: p2 in l2_4 (step 26)

- constraint 2: p1 in a1 (step 15)

- constraint 3: p2 in l2_1 (step 28)

- constraint 4: when p2 is in l2_1 (step 28), there's an earlier state where p1 was in l1_2 (step 10)

- constraint 5: p1 in l2_2 initially.

- constraint 6: after initial state (p1 in l2_2), p2 is moved to l2_3 (step 24)

- constraint 7: p2 in l2_2 initially.

- constraint 8: when p2 is in l2_2 (initially), p1 is moved to l1_2 (step 10) later.

So all constraints are satisfied. Now, check if the plan is valid and optimal.

Count the steps: 28 actions. Is there a shorter way?

But given the complexity of the constraints, this might be the minimal plan.

However, perhaps some steps can be optimized. For example, after step 3, t2 is at l2_1. To move p2, we need to drive t2 back to l2_2. But this is done after delivering p1. Alternatively, interleave the steps.

But due to time constraints, I'll proceed with this plan as the solution.
