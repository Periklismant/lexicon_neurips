Let me go through the problem carefully to understand the task and the constraints.

We have:
- Cities c1 and c2, each with an airport (l1_1 for c1, l2_1 for c2) and multiple locations.
- Package p1 starts at location l2_2, and we need to eventually get it to location l2_4.
- Package p2 starts at location l2_2, and we need to eventually get it to location l2_1.
- Trucks t1 and t2 are at locations l1_3 and l2_5 respectively.
- Airplanes a1 and a2 are at airports l1_1 and l2_1 respectively.

Let's also go through the constraints:
1. At some point, p2 must be at location l2_4.
2. At some point, p1 must be in airplane a1.
3. At some point, p2 must be at location l2_1 (which is our final goal for p2).
4. If p2 is at location l2_1, then p1 must have been at either l1_3 or l2_3 at some earlier point.
5. At some point, p1 must be at location l2_2 (which is where it starts, so this is already satisfied).
6. If p1 is at l2_2, then p2 must be at either l1_4 or l2_3 at the same time or later.
7. At some point, p2 must be at location l2_2 (which is where it starts, so this is already satisfied).
8. If p2 is at l2_2, then p1 must be at either l1_2 or p2 must be at l1_3 at the same time or later.

Given these constraints, let's think about a plan:

Since p1 starts at l2_2 and p2 also starts at l2_2, constraints 5 and 7 are immediately satisfied.

For constraint 8 (triggered because p2 is at l2_2 initially), we need to either move p1 to l1_2 or move p2 to l1_3. Let's consider moving p1 to l1_2, which means we'll need a truck to transport it from l2_2 to airport l2_1, then airplane a1 (to satisfy constraint 2) to fly it to airport l1_1, and then a truck to transport it to l1_2.

For constraint 6 (triggered because p1 is at l2_2 initially), we need to move p2 to either l1_4 or l2_3. Let's consider moving p2 to l2_3 using truck t2.

Let's trace out the movements:

Initial State:
- p1 is at l2_2
- p2 is at l2_2
- t1 is at l1_3
- t2 is at l2_5
- a1 is at l1_1
- a2 is at l2_1

Now, to move p1 from l2_2 to l1_2 and p2 from l2_2 to l2_3, we'll need the trucks to transport them:

1. Drive truck t2 from l2_5 to l2_2.
2. Load package p1 into truck t2 at l2_2.
3. Load package p2 into truck t2 at l2_2.
4. Drive truck t2 from l2_2 to l2_3.
5. Unload package p2 from truck t2 at l2_3.

Now, we have met constraint 6 (p2 is at l2_3 after p1 was at l2_2). Let's continue:

6. Drive truck t2 from l2_3 to l2_1 (the airport).
7. Unload package p1 from truck t2 at l2_1.
8. Load package p1 into airplane a1 at l2_1.

Wait, there's a mistake. Airplane a1 is initially at l1_1. It needs to fly to l2_1 first:

6. Fly airplane a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
7. Drive truck t2 from l2_3 to l2_1 (the airport).
8. Unload package p1 from truck t2 at l2_1.
9. Load package p1 into airplane a1 at l2_1.

Now, we have met constraint 2 (p1 is in airplane a1). Let's continue:

10. Fly airplane a1 from l2_1 to l1_1.
11. Unload package p1 from airplane a1 at l1_1.
12. Drive truck t1 from l1_3 to l1_1.
13. Load package p1 into truck t1 at l1_1.
14. Drive truck t1 from l1_1 to l1_2.
15. Unload package p1 from truck t1 at l1_2.

Now, we have met constraint 8 (p1 is at l1_2 after p2 was at l2_2). Let's continue to satisfy constraint 4:

16. Drive truck t1 from l1_2 to l1_3.
17. Load package p1 into truck t1 at l1_3.

Now, we can move p1 from l1_3 to l2_3 to satisfy constraint 4:

18. Drive truck t1 from l1_3 to l1_1 (the airport).
19. Unload package p1 from truck t1 at l1_1.
20. Load package p1 into airplane a1 at l1_1.
21. Fly airplane a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
22. Unload package p1 from airplane a1 at l2_1.
23. Drive truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_3.
24. Load package p2 from l2_3 into truck t2.
25. Drive truck t2 from l2_3 to l2_4.
26. Unload package p2 from truck t2 at l2_4.

Now, we have met constraint 1 (p2 is at l2_4). Let's continue:

27. Drive truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
28. Unload package p1 from truck t2 at l2_1.
29. Load package p2 into truck t2 at l2_4.
30. Drive truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
31. Unload package p2 from truck t2 at l2_1.

Now, we have met constraint 3 (p2 is at l2_1).

Finally, to achieve our goal, we need to move p1 to l2_4:

32. Load package p1 into truck t2 at l2_1.
33. Drive truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_4.
34. Unload package p1 from truck t2 at l2_4.

However, there's a problem in this plan:
- I said I had p1 in truck t2 and dropped it off at l2_1, but then I think I forgot that I needed to actually move p1 to l2_4.
- I also said I unloaded p1 from truck t2 at l2_1, but I had already had p1 unloaded at l2_1 earlier.

Let me revise the plan:

Wait, I notice another inconsistency. I was assuming Packages t1, t2, a1, and a2 are objects, but in fact, those are not packages. I need to re-read the problem. 

Ok, I see my mistake. The state description contains the packages, trucks, and airplanes. The problem says:
- "Package t1 is in location l1_3"
- "Package t2 is in location l2_5"
- "Package p1 is in location l2_2"
- "Package p2 is in location l2_2"
- "Package a1 is in location l1_1"
- "Package a2 is in location l2_1"

I think there's a naming mistake here, and t1, t2, a1, and a2 should be referred to as "Truck" and "Airplane" not "Package". I'll assume that's the case.

So the initial state is:
- Truck t1 is at location l1_3
- Truck t2 is at location l2_5
- Package p1 is at location l2_2
- Package p2 is at location l2_2
- Airplane a1 is at location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is at location l2_1

Let me replan:

Initial State:
- p1 is at l2_2
- p2 is at l2_2
- t1 is at l1_3
- t2 is at l2_5
- a1 is at l1_1
- a2 is at l2_1

Goal:
- p1 is at l2_4
- p2 is at l2_1

Constraints (summarized):
- p2 must be at l2_4 at some point
- p1 must be in a1 at some point
- p2 must be at l2_1 at some point
- If p2 is at l2_1, then p1 must have been at l1_3 or l2_3 earlier
- p1 must be at l2_2 at some point (already satisfied initially)
- If p1 is at l2_2, then p2 must be at l1_4 or l2_3 at the same time or later
- p2 must be at l2_2 at some point (already satisfied initially)
- If p2 is at l2_2, then p1 must be at l1_2 or p2 must be at l1_3 at the same time or later

Let's construct the plan step by step:

1. Drive truck t2 from l2_5 to l2_2.
2. Load package p1 into truck t2 at l2_2.
3. Load package p2 into truck t2 at l2_2.
4. Drive truck t2 from l2_2 to l2_3.
5. Unload package p2 from truck t2 at l2_3.

At this point, p2 is at l2_3, which satisfies the constraint "If p1 is at l2_2, then p2 must be at l1_4 or l2_3 at the same time or later." (constraint 6)

6. Drive truck t2 from l2_3 to l2_1 (the airport).
7. Unload package p1 from truck t2 at l2_1.
8. Load package p1 into airplane a2 at l2_1.
9. Fly airplane a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
10. Unload package p1 from airplane a2 at l1_1.
11. Load package p1 into airplane a1 at l1_1.

At this point, p1 is in a1, which satisfies the constraint "p1 must be in a1 at some point" (constraint 2)

12. Fly airplane a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
13. Unload package p1 from airplane a1 at l2_1.
14. Drive truck t1 from l1_3 to l1_1 (the airport).
15. Fly airplane a1 from l2_1 to l1_1.
16. Load package p1 into airplane a1 at l1_1.
17. Fly airplane a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
18. Unload package p1 from airplane a1 at l2_1.
19. Drive truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_3.
20. Load package p2 from l2_3 into truck t2.
21. Drive truck t2 from l2_3 to l2_4.
22. Unload package p2 from truck t2 at l2_4.

At this point, p2 is at l2_4, which satisfies the constraint "p2 must be at l2_4 at some point" (constraint 1)

23. Drive truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
24. Load package p2 into truck t2 at l2_4.
25. Drive truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
26. Unload package p2 from truck t2 at l2_1.

Hmm, I think I'm making some mistakes and repeating steps unnecessarily. Let me rethink the plan more systematically.

Also, I want to ensure I address constraint 8: "If p2 is at l2_2, then p1 must be at either l1_2 or p2 must be at l1_3 at the same time or later."

Since p2 starts at l2_2, I need to ensure either p1 is at l1_2 or p2 is at l1_3 at some point. Let's pick one, say moving p1 to l1_2. I'll also ensure I address constraint 4: "If p2 is at l2_1, then p1 must have been at either l1_3 or l2_3 at some earlier point."

Since I'll move p2 to l2_1, I need to ensure p1 is at l1_3 or l2_3 before that. I'll pick l1_3.

So, I'll need to move:
- p1 from l2_2 to l1_2 to l1_3, then to l2_4 for our goal.
- p2 from l2_2 to l2_3 (to satisfy constraint 6), then to l2_4 (to satisfy constraint 1), then to l2_1 for our goal.

Let's chart the movements carefully:

0. Initial state: p1 and p2 at l2_2, t1 at l1_3, t2 at l2_5, a1 at l1_1, a2 at l2_1

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
3. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
4. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
5. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (Now p2 is at l2_3, satisfying constraint 6)
6. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
7. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
8. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
9. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
10. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
11. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (Now p1 is in a1, satisfying constraint 2)
12. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
13. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
14. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
15. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
16. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
17. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 (Now p1 is at l1_2, satisfying constraint 8)
18. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1
19. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
20. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (Now p1 is at l1_3, satisfying constraint 4 for later when p2 is at l2_1)
21. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
22. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
23. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
24. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (Now p2 is at l2_4, satisfying constraint 1)
25. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
26. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
27. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
28. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (Now p2 is at l2_1, satisfying constraint 3 and part of our goal)
29. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
30. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
31. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_1 c1
32. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
33. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
34. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
35. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
36. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
37. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
38. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (Now p1 is at l2_4, achieving our goal)

Wait, I noticed I made a bunch of errors. Let me think through the plan again step by step.

0. Initial state: p1 and p2 at l2_2, t1 at l1_3, t2 at l2_5, a1 at l1_1, a2 at l2_1

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
3. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
4. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
5. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (Now p2 is at l2_3, satisfying constraint 6)
6. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
7. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
8. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
9. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
10. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
11. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (Now p1 is in a1, satisfying constraint 2)
12. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
13. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
14. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
15. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

Wait, I think I'm getting confused because I'm trying to plan this out in one go. There's a few issues with the above plan:
- From steps 7-13, p1 is doing a slightly circular route.
- I'm not clearly addressing all constraints.

Let me reorganize and think about how best to address each constraint:

1. "p2 must be at l2_4 at some point" - We need to move p2 from l2_2 to l2_4.
2. "p1 must be in a1 at some point" - We need to get p1 to an airport (l1_1 or l2_1) and load it into a1.
3. "p2 must be at l2_1 at some point" - We need to move p2 from l2_2 (or l2_4) to l2_1.
4. "If p2 is at l2_1, then p1 must have been at l1_3 or l2_3 earlier" - Before moving p2 to l2_1, we need to ensure p1 has visited l1_3 or l2_3.
5. "p1 must be at l2_2 at some point" - This is already satisfied as p1 starts at l2_2.
6. "If p1 is at l2_2, then p2 must be at l1_4 or l2_3 at the same time or later" - After starting, we need to move p2 to either l1_4 or l2_3.
7. "p2 must be at l2_2 at some point" - This is already satisfied as p2 starts at l2_2.
8. "If p2 is at l2_2, then p1 must be at l1_2 or p2 must be at l1_3 at the same time or later" - After starting, we need to either move p1 to l1_2 or move p2 to l1_3.

The goal is:
- p1 is at l2_4
- p2 is at l2_1

I'll plan a more streamlined route for both packages. First, let's address the constraints that arise from the initial state:

Constraints 5 and 7 are already satisfied.
For constraint 6, we need to move p2 to l2_3 or l1_4.
For constraint 8, we need to move p1 to l1_2 or p2 to l1_3.

Let's pick: move p2 to l2_3 for constraint 6 and move p1 to l1_2 for constraint 8.

Let's start the plan again:

0. Initial state: p1 and p2 at l2_2, t1 at l1_3, t2 at l2_5, a1 at l1_1, a2 at l2_1

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
3. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
4. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
5. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (Now p2 is at l2_3, satisfying constraint 6)
6. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
7. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
8. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
9. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
10. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
11. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
12. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
13. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
14. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 (Now p1 is at l1_2, satisfying constraint 8)
15. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1
16. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
17. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (Now p1 is at l1_3, satisfying part of constraint 4 for later when p2 is at l2_1)
18. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
19. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
20. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
21. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

26. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
27. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
28. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (Now p2 is at l2_4, satisfying constraint 1)
29. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
30. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
31. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (Now p2 is at l2_1, satisfying constraint 3 and part of our goal)
32. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
33. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
34. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (Now p1 is at l2_4, achieving our goal)

Wait, I've noticed a repetition at steps 16-17 and 18-21. Let me adjust and finalize the plan:

0. Initial state: p1 and p2 at l2_2, t1 at l1_3, t2 at l2_5, a1 at l1_1, a2 at l2_1

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
3. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
4. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
5. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (Now p2 is at l2_3, satisfying constraint 6)
6. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

26. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
27. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (Now p2 is at l2_4, satisfying constraint 1)
28. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

32. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
33. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (Now p1 is at l2_4, achieving our goal)

Actually, I have another issue at steps 16-17: I load p1 and immediately unload it from t1, which serves no purpose. Let me clean this up:

0. Initial state: p1 and p2 at l2_2, t1 at l1_3, t2 at l2_5, a1 at l1_1, a2 at l2_1

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
3. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
4. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
5. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (Now p2 is at l2_3, satisfying constraint 6)

17. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1
18. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (Now p1 is at l1_3, satisfying part of constraint 4 for later when p2 is at l2_1)
19. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
20. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
21. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
22. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (Now p1 is in a1, satisfying constraint 2)
23. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

25. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
26. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
27. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
28. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (Now p2 is at l2_4, satisfying constraint 1)
29. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

33. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
34. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (Now p1 is at l2_4, achieving our goal)

I'm noticing more issues with steps 16-17. I unloaded p1 at l1_2 in step 14, but I'm immediately loading it from l1_2 in step 16 but the truck is already at l1_3 from step 15. Let me fix the plan:

0. Initial state: p1 and p2 at l2_2, t1 at l1_3, t2 at l2_5, a1 at l1_1, a2 at l2_1

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2

3. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
4. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2

32. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
33. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (Now p1 is at l2_4, achieving our goal)

Wait, I unload and reload p1 a few times unnecessarily:
- at steps 17-18
- at steps 20-21

Let me adjust the plan one more time and this time I'll be careful to avoid these inefficiencies:

0. Initial state: p1 and p2 at l2_2, t1 at l1_3, t2 at l2_5, a1 at l1_1, a2 at l2_1

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
3. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
4. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
5. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (Now p2 is at l2_3, satisfying constraint 6)
6. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
7. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
8. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
9. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
10. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
11. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
12. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
13. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
14. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 (Now p1 is at l1_2, satisfying constraint 8)
15. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
16. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1
17. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (Now p1 is at l1_3, satisfying part of constraint 4 for later when p2 is at l2_1)
18. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
19. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (Skipped a step of loading p1 onto truck t1 and unloading at l1_1)
20. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
21. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 (Now p1's been in a1, satisfying constraint 2)
22. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
23. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
24. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
25. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (Now p2 is at l2_4, satisfying constraint 1)
26. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
27. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
28. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (Now p2 is at l2_1, satisfying constraint 3 and part of our goal)
29. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
30. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
31. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (Now p1 is at l2_4, achieving our goal)

Wait, I don't think step 19 is valid because the precondition for "loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1" is that p1 and a1 are in the same location l1_1. But after step 17, p1 is at l1_3 and after step 18, neither p1 nor t1 is at l1_1. 

Let me adjust once more:

0. Initial state: p1 and p2 at l2_2, t1 at l1_3, t2 at l2_5, a1 at l1_1, a2 at l2_1

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
3. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
4. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
5. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (Now p2 is at l2_3, satisfying constraint 6)
6. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
7. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
8. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
9. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
10. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
11. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
12. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
13. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
14. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 (Now p1 is at l1_2, satisfying constraint 8)
15. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
16. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1
17. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (Now p1 is at l1_3, satisfying part of constraint 4 for later when p2 is at l2_1)
18. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
19. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
20. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
21. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (Now p1 is in a1, satisfying constraint 2)
22. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
23. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
24. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
25. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
26. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
27. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (Now p2 is at l2_4, satisfying constraint 1)
28. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
29. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
30. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (Now p2 is at l2_1, satisfying constraint 3 and part of our goal)
31. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
32. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
33. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (Now p1 is at l2_4, achieving our goal)

I think this plan is now correct and optimal.

Actually, I just noticed I don't need the immediate load after an unload (like steps 14-15), which doesn't serve a useful purpose. Let me optimize the plan once more:

0. Initial state: p1 and p2 at l2_2, t1 at l1_3, t2 at l2_5, a1 at l1_1, a2 at l2_1

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
3. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
4. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
5. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (Now p2 is at l2_3, satisfying constraint 6)
6. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
7. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
8. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
9. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
10. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
11. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
12. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
13. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
14. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 (Now p1 is at l1_2, satisfying constraint 8)
15. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1 (I skip loading p1 here and just move the truck)
16. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1 (I move the truck back to pick up p1)
17. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
18. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1
19. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (Now p1 is at l1_3, satisfying part of constraint 4 for later when p2 is at l2_1)
20. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
21. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
22. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
23. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (Now p1 is in a1, satisfying constraint 2)
24. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
25. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
26. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
27. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
28. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
29. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (Now p2 is at l2_4, satisfying constraint 1)
30. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
31. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
32. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (Now p2 is at l2_1, satisfying constraint 3 and part of our goal)
33. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
34. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
35. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (Now p1 is at l2_4, achieving our goal)

I introduced new inefficiencies! I'm going to step back and attempt a more direct approach by considering what's necessary for the final goal and working backwards.

Our goal: p1 is at l2_4, p2 is at l2_1.

To achieve this, we need to move:
- p1 from its starting location l2_2 to l2_4.
- p2 from its starting location l2_2 to l2_1.

But we also need to satisfy all constraints:
1. p2 must be at l2_4 at some point.
2. p1 must be in a1 at some point.
3. p2 must be at l2_1 at some point (this is our final goal for p2).
4. If p2 is at l2_1, then p1 must have been at l1_3 or l2_3 earlier.
5. p1 must be at l2_2 at some point (this is already satisfied as p1 starts at l2_2).
6. If p1 is at l2_2, then p2 must be at l1_4 or l2_3 at the same time or later.
7. p2 must be at l2_2 at some point (this is already satisfied as p2 starts at l2_2).
8. If p2 is at l2_2, then p1 must be at l1_2 or p2 must be at l1_3 at the same time or later.

Constraints 5 and 7 are automatically satisfied by the initial state.
Constraint 6 requires us to move p2 to l1_4 or l2_3 after the start. Let's say we move it to l2_3.
Constraint 8 requires us to move p1 to l1_2 or p2 to l1_3 after the start. Let's say we move p1 to l1_2.
Constraint 4 requires that before p2 is at l2_1, p1 must be at l1_3 or l2_3. Let's say we move p1 to l1_3.
Constraint 1 requires us to move p2 to l2_4 at some point.
Constraint 2 requires us to have p1 in a1 at some point.
Constraint 3 requires us to move p2 to l2_1 at some point, which is also part of our goal.

Let's plan a path for both packages:

For p1: l2_2 -> l2_1 -> l1_1 -> l1_2 -> l1_3 -> l1_1 -> (in a1) -> l2_1 -> l2_4
For p2: l2_2 -> l2_3 -> l2_4 -> l2_1

Given these paths, let's create a plan:

0. Initial state: p1 and p2 at l2_2, t1 at l1_3, t2 at l2_5, a1 at l1_1, a2 at l2_1

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
3. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
4. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
5. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (Now p2 is at l2_3, satisfying constraint 6)
6. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
7. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
8. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
9. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
10. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
11. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
12. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
13. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
14. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 (Now p1 is at l1_2, satisfying constraint 8)
15. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
16. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1
17. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (Now p1 is at l1_3, satisfying part of constraint 4 for later when p2 is at l2_1)
18. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
19. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
20. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
21. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (Now p1 is in a1, satisfying constraint 2)
22. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
23. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
24. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
25. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
26. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
27. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (Now p2 is at l2_4, satisfying constraint 1)
28. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
29. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
30. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (Now p2 is at l2_1, satisfying constraint 3 and part of our goal)
31. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
32. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
33. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (Now p1 is at l2_4, achieving our goal)

I think this plan is correct and optimal. Let me review:

Constraints:
- Constraint 1: p2 is at l2_4 (satisfied at step 27)
- Constraint 2: p1 is in a1 (satisfied at step 21)
- Constraint 3: p2 is at l2_1 (satisfied at step 30)
- Constraint 4: If p2 is at l2_1, then p1 must have been at l1_3 or l2_3 earlier (p1 is at l1_3 at step 17, which is before p2 is at l2_1 at step 30)
- Constraint 5: p1 is at l2_2 (satisfied in the initial state)
- Constraint 6: If p1 is at l2_2, then p2 must be at l1_4 or l2_3 at the same time or later (p2 is at l2_3 at step 5, which is after p1 is at l2_2 in the initial state)
- Constraint 7: p2 is at l2_2 (satisfied in the initial state)
- Constraint 8: If p2 is at l2_2, then p1 must be at l1_2 or p2 must be at l1_3 at the same time or later (p1 is at l1_2 at step 14, which is after p2 is at l2_2 in the initial state)

Goal:
- p1 is at l2_4 (achieved at step 33)
- p2 is at l2_1 (achieved at step 30)

Looks all good! However, there are other ways to satisfy some of the constraints:
- For constraint 4, we could have moved p1 to l2_3 instead of l1_3.
- For constraint 6, we could have moved p2 to l1_4 instead of l2_3.
- For constraint 8, we could have moved p2 to l1_3 instead of p1 to l1_2.

But I'm confident this is one of the optimal plans.

Let me organize the final plan:

```
drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
```

Wait, I think I misread the state: I think there's a description issue. It mentions "Package t1 is in location l1_3" which means t1 is a package, not a truck. But we were told t1 is a truck. I think this is a mistake and it should be "Truck t1 is in location l1_3", since t1 is defined as a truck in the objects list. Same for the other truck and airplanes.

So to be clear, the initial state is:
- Package p1 is at location l2_2
- Package p2 is at location l2_2
- Truck t1 is at location l1_3
- Truck t2 is at location l2_5
- Airplane a1 is at location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is at location l2_1

I'll go with this understanding, and the plan I've created is based on this.
