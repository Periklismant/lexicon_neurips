Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. So the goal is to have both p1 and p2 back in location l1_3. But wait, the initial state says that p1 and p2 are already in l1_3. Hmm, maybe there's a typo? Let me check again. Oh, the original state says "Package p1 is in location l1_3" and same for p2. So the goal is their current state. That seems odd. But maybe there's a mistake in the problem setup, or perhaps the packages need to be moved and then returned. But given the constraints, maybe the solution requires moving them out and back?

Wait, but the constraints are complex. Let me read the constraints carefully. The first constraint says that at least once, p2 must be in a1 or l2_5. Second constraint: p1 is in t2 or p2 is in l2_3. Third: p2 in l2_4 or a2. Fourth: p1 in a1 or l2_5. Fifth: p2 in l2_2 or a2. So even though the initial state has p1 and p2 in l1_3, we need to perform actions that satisfy these constraints in some intermediate states. But the final goal is to have them back where they started. So the plan needs to move them around to meet the constraints and then return them.

So the challenge is to create a sequence where, for each constraint, at some point the condition is met. Let's list each constraint and figure out how to satisfy them.

Constraint 1: p2 must be in a1 or l2_5 at some point. Initially, p2 is in l1_3. To get it into a1 (which is in l1_1, an airport in c1), we need to load it into a1. But a1 is in l1_1, so we'd need to move p2 to l1_1 first. Alternatively, l2_5 is in c2. So maybe we can drive a truck from c2 to l2_5 and unload p2 there. But wait, how would p2 get to c2? Since airplanes can fly between airports. Let's think.

Constraint 2: p1 in t2 (which is a truck in c2, as per the original state, "Package t2 is in location l2_5") or p2 in l2_3. So t2 is in l2_5. To get p1 into t2, we need to move p1 to c2, perhaps via airplane. But p1 starts in c1. So maybe fly a1 to c2's airport, then load into a truck there. But t2 is in l2_5, which is in c2. So if we can get p1 into t2, that would satisfy constraint 2.

Constraint 3: p2 in l2_4 or a2. a2 is in l2_1 (airport of c2). So getting p2 to l2_4 or into a2 would work.

Constraint 4: p1 in a1 or l2_5. a1 is in l1_1 (c1's airport). So to get p1 into a1, we can load it there. But l2_5 is in c2. So maybe p1 needs to be in l2_5 at some point.

Constraint 5: p2 in l2_2 or a2. l2_2 is in c2, so again, moving p2 to c2 locations.

So the plan must involve moving p1 and p2 through various cities and vehicles to meet these constraints, then bring them back to l1_3.

Let me outline possible steps.

First, since both packages start in l1_3, which is in c1. To get p2 to l2_5 (constraint 1), we need to transport it to c2. Let's use airplanes. Let's take p2 from l1_3, load into a truck in c1, drive to l1_1 (airport), load into a1, fly a1 to l2_1 (c2's airport), unload p2 into a2 (if needed?), but wait, a2 is already in l2_1. So maybe load p2 into a2 and then unload in l2_1. Wait, but to get to l2_5, which is a location in c2. So from l2_1, use truck t2 (which is in l2_5 initially). Wait, original state says "Package t1 is in location l1_5" and "Package t2 is in location l2_5". Wait, wait, the original state says "Package t1 is in l1_5", but t1 is a truck. So maybe that's a typo, perhaps "Truck t1 is in l1_5". Similarly for t2. Because the problem defines trucks, airplanes, packages as separate. So maybe the user made a mistake here. Let me check the original state again:

Original state:

"Package t1 is in location l1_5"

"Package t2 is in location l2_5"

"Package p1 is in location l1_3"

"Package p2 is in location l1_3"

"Package a1 is in location l1_1"

"Package a2 is in location l2_1"

Wait, that can't be right. Because t1 and t2 are trucks, not packages. The user probably made a mistake here. Let me check the problem statement again.

In the problem statement, under "The world includes the following objects", they list:

"truck t1"

"truck t2"

"airplane a1"

"airplane a2"

So the original state probably has the trucks and airplanes in certain locations, but the original state says:

"Package t1 is in location l1_5"

"Package t2 is in location l2_5"

"Package a1 is in location l1_1"

"Package a2 is in location l2_1"

This seems incorrect. Because t1 is a truck, not a package. So this is likely a typo. The user probably meant:

"Truck t1 is in location l1_5"

"Truck t2 is in location l2_5"

"Airplane a1 is in location l1_1"

"Airplane a2 is in location l2_1"

Otherwise, the problem is impossible because trucks and airplanes are treated as packages, which can't be moved. So I'll proceed under the assumption that these are typos and correct them. Otherwise, the problem can't be solved. For example, trucks can't be driven if they're packages. So the correct initial state would have:

- Truck t1 in l1_5

- Truck t2 in l2_5

- Airplane a1 in l1_1

- Airplane a2 in l2_1

Assuming that, then the initial positions of the packages p1 and p2 are in l1_3.

So the goal is to have p1 and p2 in l1_3, which is where they already are. So the plan must involve moving them away and back, but satisfying all constraints along the way.

So the problem is to create a plan where the packages are moved in a way that satisfies each of the five constraints in some state, but then returned to their original location.

Let's take each constraint and see how to satisfy them.

Constraint 1: p2 in a1 or l2_5. Let's pick l2_5. To get p2 to l2_5, which is in c2. So we need to move p2 from c1 to c2. The steps would be:

1. Move p2 from l1_3 to l1_1 (airport in c1) via truck t1.

Wait, t1 is in l1_5. So first, drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_3. Then load p2 into t1. Then drive t1 to l1_1. Then load p2 into a1. Then fly a1 to l2_1 (c2's airport). Then unload p2 from a1 into t2 (since t2 is in l2_5). Wait, but t2 is in l2_5. Wait, the airport in c2 is l2_1. So from l2_1, we need to drive t2 to l2_1? Or perhaps use another truck in c2. Wait, the problem says each city has locations, including an airport. In c2, the airport is l2_1, and other locations l2_2 to l2_5. The truck t2 is in l2_5. So to get p2 from l2_1 to l2_5, we need to drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1, load p2 into t2, then drive back to l2_5. But t2 starts in l2_5. So steps for that:

But let's outline:

Plan steps for moving p2 to l2_5:

1. In c1, drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_3 (needs drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1).

2. Load p2 into t1 at l1_3 (loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3).

3. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1 (drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1).

4. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1 (unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1).

5. Load p2 into a1 at l1_1 (loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1).

6. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1 (flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1).

7. Unload p2 from a1 at l2_1 (unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1).

8. Now, p2 is in l2_1. To get it to l2_5, we need to use t2 (since t2 is in l2_5). So drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2).

9. Load p2 into t2 at l2_1 (loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1).

10. Drive t2 back to l2_5 (drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2).

11. Unload p2 at l2_5 (unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5).

Now, this satisfies constraint 1 (p2 in l2_5). Also, during step 11, p2 is in l2_5. Then, to bring it back to l1_3, we need to reverse the steps. But this is getting complicated, and the constraints must be satisfied at some point. Let's see if we can combine satisfying multiple constraints in the same steps.

Constraint 2: p1 in t2 or p2 in l2_3. Let's see. If we can get p2 into l2_3 during its journey. Alternatively, get p1 into t2. For example, when moving p1 to c2.

Constraint 3: p2 in l2_4 or a2. So maybe when p2 is in a2 (step?), but to get into a2, need to load it into a2. Suppose after flying to l2_1, instead of unloading into t2, we load into a2 and then fly to another location.

Constraint 4: p1 in a1 or l2_5. So perhaps move p1 to a1 (c1's airport) and then load into a1. But to get p1 to l2_5, need to transport to c2.

Constraint 5: p2 in l2_2 or a2. So if we get p2 into a2, that satisfies constraint 5.

So let's think of a path where p2 is moved via a1 to l2_1, then into a2, then to l2_2, then to l2_5, etc.

But this is getting complex. Let's see if we can find a minimal path that satisfies all constraints.

Alternatively, perhaps moving p2 to a1 (satisfies constraint 1), then moving p2 to a2 (satisfies constraints 3 and 5), and so on.

But let's try to outline a plan step by step, ensuring that each constraint is met.

Starting with both packages in l1_3.

First, let's handle constraint 4: p1 must be in a1 or l2_5.

Option: load p1 into a1. Since a1 is in l1_1 (airport of c1). So:

1. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_3.

2. Load p1 into t1.

3. Drive t1 to l1_1.

4. Unload p1 into l1_1.

5. Load p1 into a1.

This satisfies constraint 4 (p1 in a1). Then, later, we can unload p1 back.

But then we need to also satisfy other constraints. For example, constraint 2: p1 in t2 or p2 in l2_3. If we have p1 in a1, then we can fly a1 to l2_1, unload p1, load into t2 (which is in l2_5, so need to drive t2 to l2_1). Then, constraint 2 would be satisfied when p1 is in t2.

Similarly, for p2: need to get it into l2_5 (constraint 1), l2_3 (constraint 2), a2 (constraint 3 and 5), etc.

But this might require a lot of steps. Let's try to create a plan where both packages are moved through various locations to meet all constraints, then returned.

Alternatively, perhaps we can satisfy multiple constraints with a single action. For example, if p2 is loaded into a2, that satisfies constraint 3 and 5. If p2 is in a2, then during that time, constraint 3 (p2 in a2) and 5 (p2 in a2) are both satisfied.

Similarly, if p1 is loaded into a1, that satisfies constraint 4. If p1 is then put into t2, that satisfies constraint 2.

Let me attempt a plan outline:

1. Move p1 to a1 (satisfies constraint 4).

2. Fly a1 to l2_1.

3. Unload p1 into l2_1.

4. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1.

5. Load p1 into t2 (satisfies constraint 2).

6. Drive t2 back to l2_5 (now p1 is in l2_5, satisfying constraint 4 again? Or was constraint 4 already satisfied when p1 was in a1. But the constraint only needs to be true in at least one state. So once is enough.

Similarly for p2:

1. Move p2 to a1 (satisfies constraint 1? Because a1 is the airplane, so if p2 is loaded into a1, that would meet "p2 is in a1", satisfying constraint 1.

Then fly a1 to l2_1.

Unload p2 into l2_1.

Load p2 into a2 (satisfies constraint 3 and 5).

Then fly a2 to l2_2, unload there (satisfies constraint 5).

Then move p2 back.

But this is getting complicated. Let's try to map out each step and check constraints.

Plan steps:

For p1:

- Load into a1 (satisfies constraint4: p1 in a1).

- Fly a1 to l2_1.

- Unload p1 into l2_1.

- Load into t2 (which is driven to l2_1) (satisfies constraint2: p1 in t2).

- Drive t2 to l2_5 (unload p1 there, which satisfies constraint4 again (p1 in l2_5), but that's redundant since we already satisfied constraint4 once.

For p2:

- Load into a1 (satisfies constraint1: p2 in a1).

- Fly to l2_1.

- Unload p2 into l2_1.

- Load into a2 (satisfies constraint3 and 5: p2 in a2).

- Fly a2 to l2_2, unload p2 (satisfies constraint5: p2 in l2_2).

- Then drive t2 to l2_2, load p2, drive to l2_5 (satisfies constraint1: p2 in l2_5).

But then we need to get both packages back to l1_3. Since the goal is to have them back where they started.

So after satisfying all constraints, we need to reverse the steps to bring them back.

But this could be very long. Let's see if there's a more optimal way.

Alternatively, perhaps we can satisfy multiple constraints in a single move.

For example, moving p2 into a2 satisfies constraints 3 and 5. So that's two constraints in one action.

Similarly, moving p1 into t2 satisfies constraint2 and constraint4 (if p1 is in l2_5 when unloaded from t2).

Wait, constraint4 is p1 in a1 or l2_5. If we unload p1 into l2_5, that would satisfy constraint4.

But let's outline a possible plan:

Initial steps for p1:

1. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_3 (drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1).

2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3.

3. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1.

4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1.

5. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1. (Now p1 is in a1, satisfying constraint4.)

6. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1.

7. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1. (p1 in l2_1)

8. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2. (drive t2 to airport)

9. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1. (p1 in t2, satisfying constraint2.)

10. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2.

11. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5. (p1 in l2_5, satisfying constraint4 again.)

Now, p1 is in l2_5. To get back to l1_3, we need to:

12. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5.

13. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2.

14. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1.

15. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1.

16. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

17. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1.

18. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1.

19. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3.

20. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3. (Back to original location.)

But this is a lot of steps. For p2, we need to satisfy constraints 1,3,5.

Steps for p2:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3.

2. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1.

3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

4. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1. (constraint1: p2 in a1.)

5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1.

6. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1.

7. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1. (constraint3 and 5: p2 in a2.)

8. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l2_2.

9. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_2. (constraint5: p2 in l2_2.)

10. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2.

11. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2.

12. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2. (constraint1: p2 in l2_5.)

13. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5.

Then to return p2 to l1_3:

14. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5.

15. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2.

16. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.

17. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1.

18. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

19. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1.

20. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1.

21. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3.

22. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3.

But combining both p1 and p2's steps would require interleaving them. However, this results in a very long plan. But the problem asks for an optimal plan with minimal steps. So perhaps there's a shorter way.

Wait, maybe some steps can be combined. For example, when moving p1 and p2 together.

Alternatively, maybe using the same airplane flights for both packages.

But each package needs to go to different places. Let's see.

Alternative approach: Since the goal is to have both packages back in l1_3, perhaps the minimal plan involves moving them out to satisfy constraints and then returning them. Let's see:

For p1:

- Load into t1 in l1_3.

- Drive to l1_1.

- Load into a1 (satisfies constraint4).

- Fly to l2_1.

- Unload.

- Load into t2 (satisfies constraint2).

- Drive to l2_5 (satisfies constraint4 again).

- Then reverse these steps to bring back.

For p2:

- Load into t1.

- Drive to l1_1.

- Load into a1 (satisfies constraint1).

- Fly to l2_1.

- Unload.

- Load into a2 (satisfies constraint3 and 5).

- Fly to l2_2 (satisfies constraint5).

- Unload.

- Drive via t2 to l2_5 (satisfies constraint1).

- Then reverse to return.

But combining these steps, maybe sharing the same airplane flights.

But this still seems long. Let's count steps.

Alternatively, perhaps some constraints can be satisfied in the same action.

For example, when p2 is loaded into a2, that satisfies constraint3 and 5. So two constraints in one load.

Similarly, when p1 is loaded into a1, that satisfies constraint4, and when loaded into t2, satisfies constraint2.

So perhaps the minimal steps are:

For p1:

1. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3.

2. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1.

3. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1.

4. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1. (constraint4 met here)

5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1.

6. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1.

7. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2.

8. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1. (constraint2 met here)

9. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2.

10. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5. (constraint4 met here)

Then return:

11. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5.

12. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2.

13. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1.

14. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1.

15. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

16. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1.

17. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1.

18. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3.

For p2:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3.

2. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1.

3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

4. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1. (constraint1 met here)

5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1.

6. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1.

7. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1. (constraint3 and5 met here)

8. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l2_2.

9. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_2. (constraint5 met here)

10. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2.

11. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2.

12. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2. (constraint1 met here)

13. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5.

Returning p2:

14. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5.

15. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2.

16. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.

17. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1.

18. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

19. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1.

20. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1.

21. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3.

But this results in 21 steps for p2 and 18 for p1, but some steps can be combined. For example, steps 1-3 for p1 and p2 can be done in parallel if using the same truck and same movement. But since the problem allows concurrent actions, but the plan is a sequence. So need to interleave steps.

But this would make the plan very long. However, the problem requires an optimal plan with minimal length. So perhaps there's a smarter way.

Wait, perhaps some steps can be reused. For example, moving both p1 and p2 together in the same truck or airplane.

For example, after loading both into t1, drive to l1_1, then load both into a1. Then fly to l2_1, unload both, and proceed. But each action can only handle one package at a time, but if we load them one by one.

But even then, it's possible to combine some steps.

Another angle: Since the final goal requires no change (they're already in l1_3), perhaps the minimal plan is to do nothing. But that can't be because the constraints require certain intermediate states.

But according to the problem statement, the initial state has the packages in the goal locations. However, the constraints require that during the plan, certain conditions are met. So the plan must include actions that create those intermediate states, even if the final state is the same as the initial.

So even though the goal is already met, the plan must include actions that move the packages to satisfy the constraints, then return them.

Thus, the minimal plan must include the minimal steps to meet all constraints and return.

But how to do that optimally.

Let me think of the minimal steps required to satisfy each constraint:

Constraint1: p2 in a1 or l2_5. Let's choose to load p2 into a1.

Constraint2: p1 in t2 or p2 in l2_3. Let's choose to load p1 into t2.

Constraint3: p2 in l2_4 or a2. Let's choose to load p2 into a2.

Constraint4: p1 in a1 or l2_5. Let's choose to load p1 into a1.

Constraint5: p2 in l2_2 or a2. Let's choose to load p2 into a2.

So if we can load p2 into both a1 and a2, and p1 into a1 and t2, perhaps we can satisfy all constraints with a minimal number of steps.

Let me outline a possible plan:

Steps:

1. Load p1 into truck t1 at l1_3.

2. Drive t1 to l1_1.

3. Unload p1 at l1_1.

4. Load p1 into a1 (satisfies constraint4).

5. Fly a1 to l2_1.

6. Unload p1 into l2_1.

7. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1.

8. Load p1 into t2 (satisfies constraint2).

9. Drive t2 back to l2_5 (now p1 is in l2_5, satisfying constraint4 again).

10. Unload p1 in l2_5.

11. Load p1 back into t2.

12. Drive t2 to l2_1.

13. Unload p1 into l2_1.

14. Load p1 into a2.

15. Fly a2 to l1_1.

16. Unload p1 into l1_1.

17. Drive t1 to l1_1.

18. Load p1 into t1.

19. Drive t1 to l1_3.

20. Unload p1 into l1_3.

For p2:

1. Load p2 into t1 at l1_3.

2. Drive t1 to l1_1.

3. Unload p2 into l1_1.

4. Load p2 into a1 (satisfies constraint1).

5. Fly a1 to l2_1.

6. Unload p2 into l2_1.

7. Load p2 into a2 (satisfies constraint3 and5).

8. Fly a2 to l2_2.

9. Unload p2 into l2_2 (satisfies constraint5).

10. Drive t2 to l2_2.

11. Load p2 into t2.

12. Drive t2 to l2_5 (satisfies constraint1).

13. Unload p2 into l2_5.

14. Load p2 into t2.

15. Drive t2 to l2_1.

16. Unload p2 into l2_1.

17. Load p2 into a2.

18. Fly a2 to l1_1.

19. Unload p2 into l1_1.

20. Drive t1 to l1_1.

21. Load p2 into t1.

22. Drive t1 to l1_3.

23. Unload p2 into l1_3.

But this is way too many steps. There must be a more optimal way.

Alternatively, perhaps some steps can be shared. For example, using the same flight for both packages.

Wait, the key is that after moving p1 and p2 to c2, we can satisfy multiple constraints, then bring them back.

Let me try to find a shorter path:

1. Load both packages into t1 at l1_3.

   - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3

   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

2. Drive t1 to l1_1.

   - drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1

3. Unload both packages.

   - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

   - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

4. Load both into a1.

   - loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (satisfies constraint4)

   - loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (satisfies constraint1)

5. Fly a1 to l2_1.

   - flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

6. Unload both packages.

   - unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

   - unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

7. Load p1 into t2 (drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 first).

   - drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2

   - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (satisfies constraint2)

8. Drive t2 back to l2_5 with p1.

   - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2

   - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (satisfies constraint4)

9. Load p2 into a2.

   - loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (satisfies constraint3 and5)

10. Fly a2 to l2_2.

    - flyairplane a2 l2_1 l2_2

11. Unload p2 into l2_2 (satisfies constraint5)

12. Drive t2 to l2_2.

    - drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2

13. Load p2 into t2.

14. Drive to l2_5.

    - drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2 (satisfies constraint1)

15. Unload p2 into l2_5.

16. Now, bring both packages back to l1_3.

    For p1:

    - load p1 into t2 l2_5

    - drive to l2_1

    - unload

    - load into a2

    - fly to l1_1

    - unload

    - load into t1

    - drive to l1_3

    For p2:

    - load into t2 l2_5

    - drive to l2_1

    - unload

    - load into a2

    - fly to l1_1

    - unload

    - load into t1

    - drive to l1_3

But this is still a lot of steps. Let's see if there's a way to reuse airplanes or trucks for both packages.

Alternatively, after step 15, to bring both packages back:

16. Load p1 and p2 into a2 at l2_1 (but they are in l2_5 and l2_2). Wait, this is complicated.

Alternatively, after step 15, p1 is in l2_5 and p2 is in l2_5. Then:

16. Load p1 and p2 into t2.

17. Drive t2 to l2_1.

18. Unload into l2_1.

19. Load into a2.

20. Fly a2 to l1_1.

21. Unload into l1_1.

22. Load into t1.

23. Drive to l1_3.

24. Unload.

This would add 9 steps. So total steps would be around 24. This is very long, but maybe it's the minimal.

But the problem says to provide an optimal plan. I need to check if there's a shorter way.

Wait, perhaps some constraints can be satisfied in the same step. For example, when p2 is loaded into a2, that satisfies constraints 3 and 5. So two constraints in one action.

Similarly, when p2 is in l2_5 (step 15), that satisfies constraint1.

When p1 is loaded into t2 (step7), satisfies constraint2.

When p1 is unloaded into l2_5 (step8), satisfies constraint4.

So the steps up to step15 satisfy all constraints. Then the rest is returning the packages.

But the problem requires the final state to have the packages in l1_3. So the plan must include the steps to bring them back.

But perhaps there's a shorter path. Let's think differently.

What if we move both packages using a1 to l2_1, then load p1 into t2 (satisfies constraint2), drive t2 to l2_5 (satisfies constraint4 when p1 is unloaded there), then drive back to l2_1, load p1 into a2, fly to l1_1, then back to l1_3.

For p2: load into a2 (satisfies constraint3 and5), fly to l2_2 (satisfies constraint5 again), then drive to l2_5 (satisfies constraint1), then fly back.

But this still requires multiple steps.

Alternatively, after loading p1 into a1 (constraint4), fly to l2_1, unload, load into t2 (constraint2), drive to l2_5 (unload here satisfies constraint4), then reload into t2 and drive back to l2_1, then load into a2 and fly back.

For p2: load into a1 (constraint1), fly to l2_1, unload, load into a2 (constraint3,5), fly to l2_2 (unload, constraint5), then drive to l2_5 (constraint1), then fly back.

This seems to cover all constraints.

The steps would be:

For p1:

1. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3.

2. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1.

3. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1.

4. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1. (constraint4)

5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1.

6. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1.

7. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2.

8. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1. (constraint2)

9. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2.

10. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5. (constraint4)

11. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5.

12. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2.

13. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1.

14. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1.

15. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

16. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1.

17. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1.

18. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3.

For p2:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3.

2. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1.

3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

4. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1. (constraint1)

5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1.

6. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1.

7. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1. (constraint3,5)

8. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l2_2.

9. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_2. (constraint5)

10. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2.

11. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2.

12. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2. (constraint1)

13. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5.

14. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5.

15. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2.

16. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.

17. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1.

18. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

19. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1.

20. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1.

21. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3.

Now, combining both sequences, interleaving steps where possible. For example, steps for p1 and p2 can be interleaved to share truck and airplane movements.

But each action can only handle one package at a time. So loading p1 and p2 into a1 would require two separate actions.

Let me try to interleave the steps to minimize the total number:

1. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3

2. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

3. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1

4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

5. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

6. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (constraint4)

7. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (constraint1)

8. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

9. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

10. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

11. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2

12. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (constraint2)

13. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (constraint3,5)

14. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l2_2

15. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_2 (constraint5)

16. flyairplane a2 l2_2 l2_1 (return to l2_1)

17. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2 (with p1)

18. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (constraint4)

19. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2 (to pick up p2)

20. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

21. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2 (constraint1)

22. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5

23. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

24. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5

25. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2

26. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

27. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

28. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

29. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

30. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

31. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

32. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

33. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1

34. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3

35. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

36. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3

37. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

But this seems even longer. It's possible that I'm overcomplicating this.

Perhaps the minimal plan is to move each package once to meet the constraints and then return.

But given the constraints, each package needs to be in certain locations or vehicles.

Let me think of a plan that satisfies all constraints with the least steps.

For p1:

- Load into a1 (constraint4), then into t2 (constraint2), then back.

For p2:

- Load into a1 (constraint1), then into a2 (constraint3,5), then into l2_5 (constraint1), then back.

Let's try:

1. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3

2. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1

3. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

4. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (constraint4)

5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

6. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

7. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2

8. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (constraint2)

9. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2

10. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (constraint4)

11. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

12. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2

13. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

14. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

15. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

16. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

17. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1

18. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3

For p2:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

2. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1

3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

4. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (constraint1)

5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

6. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

7. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (constraint3,5)

8. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l2_2

9. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_2 (constraint5)

10. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2

11. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

12. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2 (constraint1)

13. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5

14. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5

15. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2

16. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

17. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

18. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

19. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

20. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1

21. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

But this is still 21 steps for p2 and 18 for p1. However, some steps can be merged when using the same truck or airplane for both packages. For example, steps 1-3 for p1 and p2 can be done together if the truck can carry both, but each load/unload is per package.

Alternatively, interleave the steps:

1. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3

2. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

3. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1

4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

5. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

6. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (c4)

7. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (c1)

8. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

9. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

10. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

11. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2

12. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (c2)

13. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (c3,5)

14. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l2_2

15. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_2 (c5)

16. flyairplane a2 l2_2 l2_1

17. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2 (with p1)

18. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (c4)

19. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2

20. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

21. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2 (c1)

22. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5

23. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

24. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5

25. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2

26. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

27. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

28. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

29. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

30. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

31. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

32. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

33. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1

34. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3

35. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

36. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3

37. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

This plan has 37 steps, which is very long. But the problem requires an optimal plan with minimal steps. There must be a shorter way.

Wait, perhaps some steps can be skipped. For example, once p1 is in t2 and then in l2_5, we don't need to move it back if we can load it into a2 directly from l2_5. But l2_5 is not an airport. So no, airplanes can only fly between airports (l1_1 and l2_1).

Alternatively, after step 18 (p1 in l2_5), we can load it into t2 and drive to l2_1, then load into a2.

Similarly for p2.

But this still requires multiple steps.

Alternative approach: Since the constraints require that each condition is met in at least one state, perhaps we can satisfy multiple constraints in a single action.

For example, if p2 is loaded into a2, that satisfies constraint3 and5.

If p1 is loaded into a1, satisfies constraint4.

If p1 is loaded into t2, satisfies constraint2.

If p2 is loaded into a1, satisfies constraint1.

Then, the minimal steps to satisfy all constraints would be:

1. Load p1 into a1 (constraint4).

2. Load p2 into a1 (constraint1).

3. Load p2 into a2 (constraint3 and5).

4. Load p1 into t2 (constraint2).

Then, to return the packages to their original locations.

But how to structure this.

Let me try:

1. Load p1 into t1, drive to l1_1, load into a1 (constraint4).

2. Fly a1 to l2_1, unload p1.

3. Load p1 into t2 (constraint2).

4. Load p2 into t1, drive to l1_1, load into a1 (constraint1).

5. Fly a1 to l2_1, unload p2.

6. Load p2 into a2 (constraint3 and5).

7. Fly a2 to l2_1 (no need, since it's already there).

8. Now, to return:

   a. Fly a2 with p2 back to l1_1.

   b. Unload, drive to l1_3.

   c. Fly a1 back with p1 (but a1 is in l2_1, needs to fly back).

But this seems possible. Let's outline:

Steps:

1. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3

2. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1

3. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

4. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (c4)

5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

6. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

7. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2

8. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (c2)

9. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2

10. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (c4)

11. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

12. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2

13. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

14. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

15. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

16. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

17. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1

18. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3

For p2:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

2. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1

3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

4. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (c1)

5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

6. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

7. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (c3,5)

8. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

9. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

10. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1

11. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

Total steps for p1: 18

Total steps for p2: 11

Combined and interleaved:

1. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3

2. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

3. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1

4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

5. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

6. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (c4)

7. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (c1)

8. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

9. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

10. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

11. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2

12. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (c2)

13. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (c3,5)

14. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

15. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

16. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1

17. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

18. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2

19. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (c4)

20. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

21. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2

22. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

23. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

24. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

25. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

26. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1

27. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3

This is 27 steps. Still long, but perhaps it's the minimal. However, I'm not sure if there's a shorter way. For example, after step 13, when p2 is loaded into a2, perhaps we can fly a2 to l2_2 to satisfy constraint5, then back to l2_1, but that adds steps. Alternatively, just flying to l1_1 directly.

Alternatively, maybe some steps can be optimized. For example, after step 14, a2 is flying to l1_1 with p2, but p1 is still in l2_1. Then, when a2 returns to l2_1 to pick up p1, but that's more steps.

But given the constraints, this seems necessary.

After reviewing, perhaps this is the minimal plan that satisfies all constraints and returns the packages to their original locations.
