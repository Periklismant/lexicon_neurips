Let me analyze this planning problem:

We have cities c1 and c2, each with multiple locations, including one airport per city (l1_1 is the airport of c1, l2_1 is the airport of c2).

We have packages p1 and p2, trucks t1 and t2, and airplanes a1 and a2.

The initial state is:
- Locations l1_1, l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5 are in city c1
- Locations l2_1, l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5 are in city c2
- Package t1 is in location l1_5 (this seems like a mistake, t1 is a truck, not a package)
- Package t2 is in location l2_5 (this seems like a mistake, t2 is a truck, not a package)
- Package p1 is in location l1_3
- Package p2 is in location l1_3
- Package a1 is in location l1_1 (this seems like a mistake, a1 is an airplane, not a package)
- Package a2 is in location l2_1 (this seems like a mistake, a2 is an airplane, not a package)

I think the intent is probably:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_5
- Truck t2 is in location l2_5
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

The goal is to have:
- Package p1 is in location l1_3
- Package p2 is in location l1_3

Interestingly, both p1 and p2 are already in location l1_3 in the initial state. So, technically, the goal is already satisfied. However, there are constraints that must be satisfied during the execution of the plan.

The constraints are:
1. At some point, either p2 is in airplane a1, or p2 is in location l2_5
2. At some point, either p1 is in truck t2, or p2 is in location l2_3
3. At some point, either p2 is in location l2_4, or p2 is in airplane a2
4. At some point, either p1 is in airplane a1, or p1 is in location l2_5
5. At some point, either p2 is in location l2_2, or p2 is in airplane a2

Given these constraints, I need to plan a sequence of actions that will temporarily move p1 and p2 to satisfy these constraints, and then return them to their original location l1_3.

Let me think through a rough plan:

1. We need to move p2 to either be in airplane a1 or in location l2_5 (constraint 1).
2. We need to move p1 to either be in truck t2 or move p2 to be in location l2_3 (constraint 2).
3. We need to move p2 to either be in location l2_4 or in airplane a2 (constraint 3).
4. We need to move p1 to either be in airplane a1 or in location l2_5 (constraint 4).
5. We need to move p2 to either be in location l2_2 or in airplane a2 (constraint 5).

Let's consider the most efficient way to satisfy these constraints.

If we move p2 to location l2_5, we satisfy constraint 1.
If we move p1 to truck t2, we satisfy constraint 2.
If we move p2 to location l2_4, we satisfy constraint 3.
If we move p1 to location l2_5, we satisfy constraint 4.
If we move p2 to location l2_2, we satisfy constraint 5.

But we need to think about the sequence of actions to achieve this. Let's try to find a plan that minimizes unnecessary movements.

Let's consider moving p2 from l1_3 to l2_5 (satisfies constraint 1), then to l2_4 (satisfies constraint 3), then to l2_3 (satisfies constraint 2 if p1 is not in t2), then to l2_2 (satisfies constraint 5).

And separately, we'd move p1 from l1_3 to be in truck t2 (satisfies constraint 2 if p2 is not in l2_3) or to l2_5 (satisfies constraint 4).

Then return both packages to l1_3.

This is a rough plan. Let's work out the details:

1. Load p2 into a truck (e.g., t1) at l1_3.
2. Drive t1 to the airport l1_1.
3. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1.
4. Load p2 into airplane a1 at l1_1 (satisfies constraint 1).
5. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
6. Unload p2 from a1 at l2_1.
7. Load p2 into truck t2 at l2_1 (assuming t2 is now at l2_1, we might need to move it from l2_5 first).
8. Drive t2 to l2_5 (satisfies constraint 1 again).
9. Drive t2 to l2_4 (satisfies constraint 3).
10. Drive t2 to l2_3 (satisfies constraint 2).
11. Drive t2 to l2_2 (satisfies constraint 5).
12. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_2.
13. Load p2 into a2 at l2_2 (assuming a2 is now at l2_2, we might need to move it from l2_1 first) (satisfies constraint 5 again).

Now, for p1:
14. Load p1 into a truck (e.g., t1) at l1_3.
15. Drive t1 to the airport l1_1.
16. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1.
17. Load p1 into airplane a1 at l1_1 (satisfies constraint 4).
18. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
19. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1.
20. Load p1 into truck t2 at l2_1 (satisfies constraint 2).
21. Drive t2 to l2_5 (satisfies constraint 4 again).
22. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_5.

Now, to get both packages back to l1_3:
23. Load p1 into t2 at l2_5.
24. Drive t2 to l2_1.
25. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1.
26. Load p1 into a1 at l2_1.
27. Load p2 into a1 at l2_1 (we need to move p2 from l2_2 to l2_1 first).
28. Fly a1 from l2_1 to l1_1.
29. Unload p1 from a1 at l1_1.
30. Unload p2 from a1 at l1_1.
31. Load p1 into t1 at l1_1.
32. Load p2 into t1 at l1_1.
33. Drive t1 to l1_3.
34. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_3.
35. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_3.

Given this rough outline, let me review the details to see if I'm missing anything or if there's a more efficient way.

I note an issue: in steps 7-12, I'm assuming t2 is at l2_1, but in the initial state, it's at l2_5. So I need to first move t2 from l2_5 to l2_1. Additionally, in step 13, I'm assuming a2 is at l2_2, but in the initial state, it's at l2_1. So I need to first move a2 from l2_1 to l2_2.

Also, in step 27, I mentioned we need to move p2 from l2_2 to l2_1 first. If we want to be more efficient, we might want to reconsider the sequence of locations for p2.

Let's refine the plan:

1. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_3.
2. Load p2 into t1 at l1_3.
3. Drive t1 to l1_1.
4. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1.
5. Load p2 into a1 at l1_1 (satisfies constraint 1).
6. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
7. Unload p2 from a1 at l2_1.
8. Load p2 into a2 at l2_1 (satisfies constraint 3 and 5).
9. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1.
10. Unload p2 from a2 at l2_1.
11. Load p2 into t2 at l2_1.
12. Drive t2 to l2_2 (satisfies constraint 5).
13. Drive t2 to l2_3 (satisfies constraint 2).
14. Drive t2 to l2_4 (satisfies constraint 3).
15. Drive t2 to l2_5 (satisfies constraint 1).
16. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_5.

Now, for p1:
17. Load p1 into t1 at l1_3.
18. Drive t1 to l1_1.
19. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1.
20. Load p1 into a1 at l1_1 (satisfies constraint 4).
21. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
22. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1.
23. Load p1 into t2 at l2_1 (assuming t2 is driven back to l2_1).
24. Drive t2 to l2_5 (satisfies constraint 4 again).
25. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_5.

Now, to get both packages back to l1_3:
26. Load p1 into t2 at l2_5.
27. Load p2 into t2 at l2_5 (already done in step 16).
28. Drive t2 to l2_1.
29. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1.
30. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1.
31. Load p1 into a1 at l2_1.
32. Load p2 into a1 at l2_1.
33. Fly a1 from l2_1 to l1_1.
34. Unload p1 from a1 at l1_1.
35. Unload p2 from a1 at l1_1.
36. Load p1 into t1 at l1_1.
37. Load p2 into t1 at l1_1.
38. Drive t1 to l1_3.
39. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_3.
40. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_3.

Once again, I've made a few assumptions for simplicity. Let me check the sequence to ensure it's consistent with the domain's rules.

I've noticed another issue: in step 26, I'm assuming p1 and p2 are both at l2_5, but p2 might still be at its previous location. I need to make sure both packages are at the same location before loading them into the same truck.

Let me rethink this plan. I'm going to be more systematic and ensure that all constraints are satisfied.

First, let's reconsider the constraints:
1. At some point, either p2 is in airplane a1, or p2 is in location l2_5.
2. At some point, either p1 is in truck t2, or p2 is in location l2_3.
3. At some point, either p2 is in location l2_4, or p2 is in airplane a2.
4. At some point, either p1 is in airplane a1, or p1 is in location l2_5.
5. At some point, either p2 is in location l2_2, or p2 is in airplane a2.

One strategy would be to move p2 through a sequence of locations to satisfy the constraints, and separately move p1 to satisfy its constraints. Then, return both packages to l1_3.

Let's try this:

For p2:
- Start: p2 is in location l1_3.
- Move p2 to be in airplane a1 (satisfies constraint 1).
- Move p2 to be in location l2_3 (satisfies constraint 2).
- Move p2 to be in location l2_4 (satisfies constraint 3).
- Move p2 to be in location l2_2 (satisfies constraint 5).
- End: p2 is back in location l1_3.

For p1:
- Start: p1 is in location l1_3.
- Move p1 to be in truck t2 (satisfies constraint 2).
- Move p1 to be in airplane a1 (satisfies constraint 4).
- End: p1 is back in location l1_3.

Now, let's ensure we have a coherent sequence of actions that achieves this:

1. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_3.
2. Load p2 into t1 at l1_3.
3. Drive t1 to l1_1.
4. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1.
5. Load p2 into a1 at l1_1 (satisfies constraint 1).
6. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
7. Unload p2 from a1 at l2_1.
8. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1.
9. Load p2 into t2 at l2_1.
10. Drive t2 to l2_3 (satisfies constraint 2).
11. Drive t2 to l2_4 (satisfies constraint 3).
12. Drive t2 to l2_2 (satisfies constraint 5).
13. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_2.
14. Load p2 into a2 at l2_2 (satisfies constraint 5 again and eventually constraint 3).
15. Fly a2 from l2_2 to l2_1.

For p1:
16. Load p1 into t1 at l1_3.
17. Drive t1 to l1_1.
18. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1.
19. Fly a1 from l2_1 to l1_1.
20. Load p1 into a1 at l1_1 (satisfies constraint 4).
21. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
22. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1.
23. Load p1 into t2 at l2_1 (satisfies constraint 2).
24. Drive t2 to l2_5 (satisfies constraint 4 again).
25. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_5.

Now, to get both packages back to l1_3:
26. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1.
27. Load p1 into a1 at l2_1.
28. Unload p2 from a2 at l2_1.
29. Load p2 into a1 at l2_1.
30. Fly a1 from l2_1 to l1_1.
31. Unload p1 from a1 at l1_1.
32. Unload p2 from a1 at l1_1.
33. Load p1 into t1 at l1_1.
34. Load p2 into t1 at l1_1.
35. Drive t1 to l1_3.
36. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_3.
37. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_3.

Wait, I think I made an error in step 14. I'm assuming a2 is at l2_2, but in the initial state, it's at l2_1. So I'd need to first fly a2 from l2_1 to l2_2. Let me redraft the plan without any such assumptions:

1. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_3.
2. Load p2 into t1 at l1_3.
3. Drive t1 to l1_1.
4. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1.
5. Load p2 into a1 at l1_1 (satisfies constraint 1).
6. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
7. Unload p2 from a1 at l2_1.
8. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1.
9. Load p2 into t2 at l2_1.
10. Drive t2 to l2_3 (satisfies constraint 2).
11. Drive t2 to l2_4 (satisfies constraint 3).
12. Drive t2 to l2_2 (satisfies constraint 5).
13. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_2.
14. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l2_2.
15. Load p2 into a2 at l2_2 (satisfies constraint 5 again and constraint 3).
16. Fly a2 from l2_2 to l2_1.
17. Unload p2 from a2 at l2_1.

For p1:
18. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_3 (after dropping p2 off at l1_1).
19. Load p1 into t1 at l1_3.
20. Drive t1 to l1_1.
21. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1.
22. Fly a1 from l2_1 to l1_1 (after dropping p2 off at l2_1).
23. Load p1 into a1 at l1_1 (satisfies constraint 4).
24. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
25. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1.
26. Load p1 into t2 at l2_1 (satisfies constraint 2).
27. Drive t2 to l2_5 (satisfies constraint 4 again).
28. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_5.

Now, to get both packages back to l1_3:
29. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1.
30. Load p1 into a1 at l2_1.
31. Load p2 into a1 at l2_1.
32. Fly a1 from l2_1 to l1_1.
33. Unload p1 from a1 at l1_1.
34. Unload p2 from a1 at l1_1.
35. Load p1 into t1 at l1_1.
36. Load p2 into t1 at l1_1.
37. Drive t1 to l1_3.
38. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_3.
39. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_3.

This is the plan I think will work. Let me trace through it one more time to make sure everything is consistent:

Actually, it seems like I'm making things more complicated than they need to be. Given that the packages are already at their target location l1_3, I should focus on just satisfying the constraints in the most efficient manner, and then ensuring the packages are back at l1_3.

Let's reconsider the constraints:
1. At some point, either p2 is in airplane a1, or p2 is in location l2_5.
2. At some point, either p1 is in truck t2, or p2 is in location l2_3.
3. At some point, either p2 is in location l2_4, or p2 is in airplane a2.
4. At some point, either p1 is in airplane a1, or p1 is in location l2_5.
5. At some point, either p2 is in location l2_2, or p2 is in airplane a2.

I can satisfy constraint 1 by putting p2 in a1.
I can satisfy constraint 2 by putting p1 in t2 or by putting p2 in l2_3.
I can satisfy constraint 3 by putting p2 in l2_4 or by putting p2 in a2.
I can satisfy constraint 4 by putting p1 in a1 or by putting p1 in l2_5.
I can satisfy constraint 5 by putting p2 in l2_2 or by putting p2 in a2.

Let's choose a set of locations/vehicles to satisfy these constraints:
- p2 in a1 (for constraint 1)
- p1 in t2 (for constraint 2)
- p2 in a2 (for constraints 3 and 5)
- p1 in a1 (for constraint 4)

I'm going to provide a condensed plan:

1. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_3.
2. Load p2 into t1 at l1_3.
3. Drive t1 to l1_1.
4. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1.
5. Load p2 into a1 at l1_1 (satisfies constraint 1).
6. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
7. Unload p2 from a1 at l2_1.
8. Load p2 into a2 at l2_1 (satisfies constraints 3 and 5).
9. Unload p2 from a2 at l2_1.

10. Drive t1 from l1_1 back to l1_3.
11. Load p1 into t1 at l1_3.
12. Drive t1 to l1_1.
13. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1.
14. Load p1 into a1 at l1_1 (satisfies constraint 4).
15. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
16. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1.
17. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1.
18. Load p1 into t2 at l2_1 (satisfies constraint 2).
19. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1.

20. Load p1 into a1 at l2_1.
21. Load p2 into a1 at l2_1.
22. Fly a1 from l2_1 to l1_1.
23. Unload p1 from a1 at l1_1.
24. Unload p2 from a1 at l1_1.
25. Load p1 into t1 at l1_1.
26. Load p2 into t1 at l1_1.
27. Drive t1 to l1_3.
28. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_3.
29. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_3.

This plan satisfies all constraints and returns both packages to l1_3. Let me formalize this under the expected action format.

Actually, I'm not fully satisfied with this plan yet. The problem asks for an optimal plan, meaning the shortest valid plan. Let me see if there are any redundancies I can eliminate.

In the above plan, I move the package p2 from l1_3 to l1_1, load it into a1, fly to l2_1, and then unload it. After some operations, I load it back into a1, fly back to l1_1, and then return it to l1_3 via t1. Similarly for p1. I'm wonder if there are ways to combine these operations to reduce the number of actions.

Let's reconsider the constraints:
1. At some point, either p2 is in airplane a1, or p2 is in location l2_5.
2. At some point, either p1 is in truck t2, or p2 is in location l2_3.
3. At some point, either p2 is in location l2_4, or p2 is in airplane a2.
4. At some point, either p1 is in airplane a1, or p1 is in location l2_5.
5. At some point, either p2 is in location l2_2, or p2 is in airplane a2.

If I move t2 from l2_5 to l2_3, and then to l2_4, and then to l2_2, and put p2 inside t2 during this journey, I can satisfy constraints 2, 3, and 5 at once. I'd still need to put p2 in a1 or move it to l2_5 for constraint 1, and put p1 in a1 or move it to l2_5 for constraint 4.

Let's try to draft a more efficient plan:

1. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_3.
2. Load p2 into t1 at l1_3.
3. Drive t1 to l1_1.
4. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1.
5. Load p2 into a1 at l1_1 (satisfies constraint 1).
6. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
7. Unload p2 from a1 at l2_1.
8. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1.
9. Load p2 into t2 at l2_1.
10. Drive t2 to l2_3 (satisfies constraint 2).
11. Drive t2 to l2_4 (satisfies constraint 3).
12. Drive t2 to l2_2 (satisfies constraint 5).
13. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_2.
14. Load p2 into a2 at l2_2 (assuming a2 has been flown to l2_2).
15. Fly a2 from l2_2 to l2_1.
16. Unload p2 from a2 at l2_1.

17. Drive t1 from l1_1 back to l1_3.
18. Load p1 into t1 at l1_3.
19. Drive t1 to l1_1.
20. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1.
21. Load p1 into a1 at l1_1 (satisfies constraint 4).
22. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
23. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1.
24. Load p1 into t2 at l2_1 (satisfies constraint 2 again).
25. Drive t2 to l2_5 (satisfies constraint 4 again).
26. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_5.

27. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1.
28. Load p1 into a1 at l2_1.
29. Load p2 into a1 at l2_1.
30. Fly a1 from l2_1 to l1_1.
31. Unload p1 from a1 at l1_1.
32. Unload p2 from a1 at l1_1.
33. Load p1 into t1 at l1_1.
34. Load p2 into t1 at l1_1.
35. Drive t1 to l1_3.
36. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_3.
37. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_3.

I've noticed a potential issue in steps 14-16. I'm assuming a2 has been flown to l2_2, but I didn't include that action in the plan. Let me revise:

1. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_3.
2. Load p2 into t1 at l1_3.
3. Drive t1 to l1_1.
4. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1.
5. Load p2 into a1 at l1_1 (satisfies constraint 1).
6. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
7. Unload p2 from a1 at l2_1.
8. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1.
9. Load p2 into t2 at l2_1.
10. Drive t2 to l2_3 (satisfies constraint 2).
11. Drive t2 to l2_4 (satisfies constraint 3).
12. Drive t2 to l2_2 (satisfies constraint 5).
13. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_2.
14. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l2_2.
15. Load p2 into a2 at l2_2 (satisfies constraint 3 and 5 again).
16. Fly a2 from l2_2 to l2_1.
17. Unload p2 from a2 at l2_1.

18. Drive t1 from l1_1 back to l1_3.
19. Load p1 into t1 at l1_3.
20. Drive t1 to l1_1.
21. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1.
22. Load p1 into a1 at l1_1 (satisfies constraint 4).
23. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
24. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1.
25. Load p1 into t2 at l2_1 (satisfies constraint 2 again).
26. Drive t2 to l2_5 (satisfies constraint 4 again).
27. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_5.

28. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1.
29. Load p1 into a1 at l2_1.
30. Load p2 into a1 at l2_1.
31. Fly a1 from l2_1 to l1_1.
32. Unload p1 from a1 at l1_1.
33. Unload p2 from a1 at l1_1.
34. Load p1 into t1 at l1_1.
35. Load p2 into t1 at l1_1.
36. Drive t1 to l1_3.
37. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_3.
38. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_3.

Actually, I'm still not fully satisfied with this plan. The problem is to get p1 and p2 back to l1_3, which they already are at the start. So, if I just need to satisfy the constraints, I don't necessarily need to end with the packages at l1_3 and then move them back.

Actually, I think there's a more direct optimization. After reading the problem statement again, I think the goal is to have p1 and p2 at l1_3. Since they're already there, we satisfy the goal. But to provide a valid plan, we must satisfy the given constraints. So, we need to, at some point, have:
- p2 in a1 or p2 in l2_5
- p1 in t2 or p2 in l2_3
- p2 in l2_4 or p2 in a2
- p1 in a1 or p1 in l2_5
- p2 in l2_2 or p2 in a2

Not all of these need to be satisfied at once, but at some point in the plan, each constraint must be satisfied.

Given this, a valid plan would be to move the packages to satisfy the constraints and then return them to l1_3 if they've been moved.

How about this approach:
1. Move p1 to be in a1 (satisfies part of constraint 4).
2. Move p2 to be in a1 (satisfies part of constraint 1).
3. Move p2 to be in a2 (satisfies parts of constraints 3 and 5).
4. Move p1 to be in t2 (satisfies part of constraint 2).
5. Move p2 to l2_3 (satisfies another part of constraint 2).
6. Move p2 to l2_4 (satisfies another part of constraint 3).
7. Move p2 to l2_2 (satisfies another part of constraint 5).
8. Return p1 and p2 to l1_3.

If I take this approach, I only need to ensure each constraint is satisfied at some point during the plan. I don't need to satisfy all at once. Given that, I think I can construct an even shorter plan. Let me draft it:

1. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_3.
2. Load p1 into t1 at l1_3.
3. Drive t1 to l1_1.
4. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1.
5. Load p1 into a1 at l1_1 (satisfies part of constraint 4).
6. Drive t1 from l1_1 back to l1_3.
7. Load p2 into t1 at l1_3.
8. Drive t1 to l1_1.
9. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1.
10. Load p2 into a1 at l1_1 (satisfies part of constraint 1).
11. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
12. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1.
13. Unload p2 from a1 at l2_1.
14. Load p2 into a2 at l2_1 (satisfies parts of constraints 3 and 5).
15. Unload p2 from a2 at l2_1.
16. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1.
17. Load p1 into t2 at l2_1 (satisfies part of constraint 2).
18. Load p2 into t2 at l2_1.
19. Drive t2 to l2_3 (satisfies another part of constraint 2).
20. Drive t2 to l2_4 (satisfies another part of constraint 3).
21. Drive t2 to l2_2 (satisfies another part of constraint 5).
22. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_2.
23. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_2.
24. Load p1 into a2 at l2_2.
25. Load p2 into a2 at l2_2 (satisfies parts of constraints 3 and 5 again).
26. Fly a2 from l2_2 to l2_1.
27. Unload p1 from a2 at l2_1.
28. Unload p2 from a2 at l2_1.
29. Load p1 into a1 at l2_1.
30. Load p2 into a1 at l2_1.
31. Fly a1 from l2_1 to l1_1.
32. Unload p1 from a1 at l1_1.
33. Unload p2 from a1 at l1_1.
34. Load p1 into t1 at l1_1.
35. Load p2 into t1 at l1_1.
36. Drive t1 to l1_3.
37. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_3.
38. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_3.

I think this plan satisfies all constraints and returns both packages to l1_3. Let me write the formal plan with the expected action format:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
3. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
5. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
6. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
7. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
8. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
9. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
10. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
11. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
12. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
13. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
14. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
15. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
16. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
17. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
18. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
19. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
20. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
21. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2
22. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
23. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
24. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l2_2
25. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_2
26. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_2
27. flyairplane a2 l2_2 l2_1
28. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
29. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
30. loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
31. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
32. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
33. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
34. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
35. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
36. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
37. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
38. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
39. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

But I'm noticing I've made errors in the ordering of actions. For instance, I have a2 flying from l2_1 to l2_2 in step 24, but the packages are already at l2_2 from steps 22-23. These kinds of inconsistencies make the plan invalid. Let me properly reorder:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
3. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
5. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1  # Satisfies constraint 4: p1 is in a1
6. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
7. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
8. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
9. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
10. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1  # Satisfies constraint 1: p2 is in a1
11. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
12. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
13. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
14. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1  # Satisfies constraints 3 and 5: p2 is in a2
15. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
16. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
17. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1  # Satisfies constraint 2: p1 is in t2
18. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
19. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2  # Satisfies constraint 2 again: p2 is in l2_3
20. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2  # Satisfies constraint 3 again: p2 is in l2_4
21. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2  # Satisfies constraint 5 again: p2 is in l2_2
22. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
23. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
24. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l2_2
25. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_2
26. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_2  # Satisfies constraints 3 and 5 once more: p2 is in a2
27. flyairplane a2 l2_2 l2_1
28. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
29. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
30. loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
31. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
32. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
33. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
34. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
35. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
36. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
37. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
38. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
39. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

One last pass to verify:
We're satisfying constraint 1 in step 10, constraint 2 in steps 17 and 19, constraint 3 in steps 14 and 20, constraint 4 in step 5, and constraint 5 in steps 14 and 21.

Wait, I think I'm still being a bit inconsistent about a2's location. Let me re-finalize:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
3. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
5. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1  # Satisfies constraint 4: p1 is in a1
6. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
7. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
8. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
9. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
10. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1  # Satisfies constraint 1: p2 is in a1
11. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
12. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
13. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
14. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1  # Satisfies constraints 3 and 5: p2 is in a2
15. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
16. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
17. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1  # Satisfies constraint 2: p1 is in t2
18. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
19. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2  # Satisfies constraint 2 again: p2 is in l2_3
20. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2  # Satisfies constraint 3 again: p2 is in l2_4
21. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2  # Satisfies constraint 5 again: p2 is in l2_2
22. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
23. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l2_2
24. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_2  # Satisfies constraints 3 and 5 once more: p2 is in a2
25. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
26. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2  # Satisfies constraint 4 again: p1 is at l2_5
27. flyairplane a2 l2_2 l2_1
28. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
29. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
30. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
31. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
32. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l1_1 c2  # This is invalid! Trucks can't move between cities.

I've discovered a flaw. Trucks can only move between locations in the same city, but I tried to move t2 from l2_1 to l1_1. This is invalid. Trucks can't travel between cities, as I previously and incorrectly tried to show in line 32. We need to use airplanes for intercity travel.

Gosh, I'm being silly. Let me re-read the problem statement. Trucks can only move within a city, while airplanes can move between airports. Each city has one airport (in this case, l1_1 for city c1 and l2_1 for city c2). Trucks and airplanes can both carry packages.

Let me restructure the plan:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
3. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
4. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
5. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
6. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
7. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1  # Satisfies constraint 4: p1 is in a1
8. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1  # Satisfies constraint 1: p2 is in a1
9. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
10. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
11. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
12. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1  # Satisfies constraints 3 and 5: p2 is in a2
13. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
14. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
15. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1  # Satisfies constraint 2: p1 is in t2
16. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
17. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2  # Satisfies constraint 2 again: p2 is in l2_3
18. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2  # Satisfies constraint 3 again: p2 is in l2_4
19. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2  # Satisfies constraint 5 again: p2 is in l2_2
20. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
21. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l2_2
22. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_2  # Satisfies constraints 3 and 5 once more: p2 is in a2
23. flyairplane a2 l2_2 l2_1
24. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
25. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
26. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5  # Satisfies constraint 4 again: p1 is at l2_5
27. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
28. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
29. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
30. loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
31. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
32. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
33. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
34. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
35. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
36. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
37. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
38. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
39. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

I think I've finally got it right. Let me double-check the locations:
- Package p1 starts at l1_3 and ends at l1_3
- Package p2 starts at l1_3 and ends at l1_3
- At various points, packages are loaded into trucks, airplanes, and unloaded at different locations to satisfy the constraints.
- All constraints are satisfied at some point in the plan.

Actually, I still need to make some edits:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
3. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
4. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
5. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
6. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
7. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1  # Satisfies constraint 4: p1 is in a1
8. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1  # Satisfies constraint 1: p2 is in a1
9. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
10. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
11. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
12. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1  # Satisfies constraints 3 and 5: p2 is in a2
13. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
14. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
15. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1  # Satisfies constraint 2: p1 is in t2
16. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
17. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2  # Satisfies constraint 2 again: p2 is in l2_3
18. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2  # Satisfies constraint 3 again: p2 is in l2_4
19. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2  # Satisfies constraint 5 again: p2 is in l2_2
20. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
21. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l2_2
22. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_2  # Satisfies constraints 3 and 5 once more: p2 is in a2
23. flyairplane a2 l2_2 l2_1
24. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
25. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
26. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5  # Satisfies constraint 4 again: p1 is at l2_5
27. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
28. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
29. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
30. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1  # Unload before loading into a1
31. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1  # Unload before loading into a1
32. loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
33. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
34. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
35. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
36. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
37. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
38. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
39. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
40. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
41. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

I think we're now reaching the final plan. Let me review one more time:
- Package p1 starts at l1_3 and ends at l1_3
- Package p2 starts at l1_3 and ends at l1_3
- All constraints are satisfied at some point in the plan, as noted in the comments.

I think this is the best plan I can provide. It may not be the absolute optimal (shortest) plan, but it should be a valid one that satisfies all the constraints.

Actually, the goal of this problem is to have both packages at l1_3, which they are already at the start. The challenge is to satisfy the given constraints.

Ok, let's take a step back. What if I minimize the plan to the bare minimum needed to satisfy the constraints?

Constraint 1: At some point, either p2 is in airplane a1, or p2 is in location l2_5.
Constraint 2: At some point, either p1 is in truck t2, or p2 is in location l2_3.
Constraint 3: At some point, either p2 is in location l2_4, or p2 is in airplane a2.
Constraint 4: At some point, either p1 is in airplane a1, or p1 is in location l2_5.
Constraint 5: At some point, either p2 is in location l2_2, or p2 is in airplane a2.

Since packages are already at their target locations, I'll focus on a plan that just ensures all constraints are satisfied. Yikes, I've been overthinking this!

Let me devise a minimalist plan:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
3. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
4. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
5. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
6. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
7. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1  # Satisfies constraint 4: p1 is in a1
8. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1  # Satisfies constraint 1: p2 is in a1
9. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
10. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
11. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
12. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1  # Satisfies constraints 3 and 5: p2 is in a2
13. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
14. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
15. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1  # Satisfies constraint 2: p1 is in t2
16. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
17. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2  # Satisfies constraint 2 again: p2 is in l2_3
18. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2  # Satisfies constraint 3 again: p2 is in l2_4
19. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2  # Satisfies constraint 5 again: p2 is in l2_2
20. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2  # Satisfies constraint 4 again: p1 is at l2_5 (since p1 is in t2)
21. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5  # To explicitly satisfy constraint 4: p1 is at l2_5
22. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5  # Satisfies constraint 1 again: p2 is at l2_5
23. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
24. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
25. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
26. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1  # Unload before loading into a1
27. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1  # Unload before loading into a1
28. loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
29. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
30. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
31. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
32. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
33. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
34. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
35. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
36. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
37. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

I think this is a valid plan. Note that I've removed some redundant steps, like moving a2 to l2_2 since we're satisfying constraint 5 by having p2 in a2 at l2_1.


I'm being overly cautious, but let me double-check to make sure all the constraints are met:
- Constraint 1: p2 is in a1 in step 8, p2 is in l2_5 in step 22.
- Constraint 2: p1 is in t2 in step 15, p2 is in l2_3 in step 17.
- Constraint 3: p2 is in a2 in step 12, p2 is in l2_4 in step 18.
- Constraint 4: p1 is in a1 in step 7, p1 is in l2_5 in step 21.
- Constraint 5: p2 is in a2 in step 12, p2 is in l2_2 in step 19.

All constraints are satisfied, and the plan ensures that both packages end up at l1_3, which is the goal. I think this is a valid and hopefully efficient plan.

The plan has 37 steps, which is quite a few, but I think it's optimized given the constraints. Is there any way to make it even shorter? Let's see if I can eliminate any more redundant steps.

Constraint 1: p2 is in a1 in step 8, p2 is in l2_5 in step 22. Keeping.
Constraint 2: p1 is in t2 in step 15, p2 is in l2_3 in step 17. Keeping.
Constraint 3: p2 is in a2 in step 12, p2 is in l2_4 in step 18. Keeping.
Constraint 4: p1 is in a1 in step 7, p1 is in l2_5 in step 21. Keeping.
Constraint 5: p2 is in a2 in step 12, p2 is in l2_2 in step 19. Keeping.

All of the constraints are necessary, and all the actions leading to them are also necessary given our sequence. I think this is the optimal plan given the constraints.
