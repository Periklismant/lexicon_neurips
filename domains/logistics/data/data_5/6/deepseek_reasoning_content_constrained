Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. Hmm, so the goal is to get package p1 to l1_4 and p2 to l1_2. But there are a bunch of constraints to satisfy along the way. Let me start by understanding the initial state and the required conditions.

First, the initial state:

- p1 is at l2_3 (city c2)
- p2 is at l1_5 (city c1)
- Trucks t1 is at l1_4 (c1), t2 is at l2_1 (c2)
- Airplanes a1 is at l1_1 (c1's airport), a2 is at l2_1 (c2's airport)

The goal is p1 at l1_4 and p2 at l1_2.

Constraints are a bit complex. Let me list them:

1. At some state, p1 must be in l1_1.
   And if p1 is in l1_1, then before that, either p2 is in l1_1 or l2_3.

2. At some state, p2 must be in l1_5. But if p2 is in l1_5 in state s, then either p1 is in l2_2 or p2 is in l1_4 must hold in s or after.

3. At some state, p1 is in l1_5 or in a1.

4. At some state, p1 is in l2_1. If this happens, then p2 must be in l2_5 at s or after.

5. At some state, p1 is in l1_3.

Wow, that's a lot. Let's break down each constraint and see how to integrate them into the plan.

Starting with the main goal: moving p1 from l2_3 (c2) to l1_4 (c1) and p2 from l1_5 (c1) to l1_2 (c1). Since cities are separated, moving between cities requires airplanes. So for p1, which is in c2, we need to get it to an airport in c2, fly to c1's airport, then use a truck in c1 to move it to l1_4. For p2, it's already in c1, so maybe use a truck to move it from l1_5 to l1_2. But there's a constraint that p2 must be in l1_5 at some point. Since it starts there, that's already satisfied. But the constraint says if in s p2 is in l1_5, then in s or after, p1 in l2_2 or p2 in l1_4. Since the goal is p2 in l1_2, we have to ensure that after p2 is in l1_5 (initial state), either p1 gets to l2_2 (which is in c2) or p2 moves to l1_4. But p2's goal is l1_2, so maybe we need to move p2 from l1_5 to l1_4 first, then to l1_2. But wait, the goal is l1_2, so maybe moving p2 via l1_4 would satisfy the constraint when p2 is in l1_5 (initial state) and then p2 moves to l1_4. That would satisfy the condition because after the state where p2 is in l1_5 (initial), we move it to l1_4, which meets the constraint.

But let's look at each constraint step by step.

First constraint: p1 must be in l1_1 at some state. So during the plan, we need to have p1 at l1_1. Also, when that happens, there must have been an earlier state where p2 is in l1_1 or l2_3. Since p2 starts in l1_5 (c1), l2_3 is in c2. So getting p2 to l1_1 or l2_3 before p1 is in l1_1. But how?

Wait, the initial state of p2 is l1_5. So unless we move p2 to l1_1 or l2_3, that condition isn't met. So for the first constraint, when p1 is in l1_1, we need to have had p2 in one of those locations before.

But p2 starts in l1_5. So to get p2 to l1_1, we can use a truck. Since t1 is in l1_4 (c1), we can drive it to l1_5 (same city), load p2 into t1, then drive to l1_1 (assuming l1_1 is in c1, which it is). But wait, the airport l1_1 is in c1, and other locations are l1_2, etc. So maybe t1 can drive from l1_4 to l1_5, load p2, then drive to l1_1. But t1 is initially at l1_4. So steps for p2: drive t1 to l1_5, load p2 into t1, drive t1 to l1_1, unload p2. Then p2 is in l1_1, which would satisfy the condition for the first constraint's antecedent. Then, when p1 is later moved to l1_1, the prior condition is met.

But why would we need to do this? Because the first constraint says that whenever p1 is in l1_1, p2 must have been in l1_1 or l2_3 before. So if we have to get p1 to l1_1 at some point, we need to ensure that before that, p2 was in one of those locations. So perhaps moving p2 to l1_1 first, then moving p1 to l1_1. Then the condition is met.

But how does this fit into the overall plan? Let's think about moving p1 from l2_3 (c2) to l1_4 (c1). To move between cities, we need an airplane. So in c2, the airports are l2_1. So perhaps load p1 into a truck (t2) at l2_3, drive to l2_1 (airport), load into a2, fly to l1_1 (c1's airport), unload into a1, then load into a truck (t1?), drive to l1_4. But t1 is in c1, so maybe after flying to l1_1, unload p1 from a1 into a truck (like t1, which would need to be driven to l1_1 first? Because t1 starts at l1_4.

Wait, initial positions: t1 is at l1_4 (c1). So to get p1 from a1 at l1_1 (after flying), we need t1 to be at l1_1. So drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1. Then load p1 into t1, drive to l1_4, unload. That would work. But along the way, we have to satisfy the constraints.

But let's outline the steps for p1:

1. In c2, p1 is at l2_3. Need to get it to l2_1 (airport) to fly. So use truck t2, which is at l2_1. Wait, initial state says "Package t1 is in location l1_4", "Package t2 is in location l2_1". Wait, maybe there's a typo here. Wait, the original state says:

"Package t1 is in location l1_4"

Wait, that can't be right. Because t1 is a truck. Wait, looking back, the original state says:

"Package t1 is in location l1_4"

But t1 is a truck. Wait, that must be a mistake. Because trucks are not packages. Wait, the user probably made a mistake here. Let me check the problem statement again.

Wait, the world includes "truck t1", "truck t2", "package p1", "package p2", etc. So the original state says:

"Package t1 is in location l1_4"

Wait, that's impossible because t1 is a truck. So this must be a typo. Probably, it's supposed to be "Truck t1 is in location l1_4". Similarly for others. Let me check the problem statement again.

Looking at the original state:

Wait, the user wrote:

The original state of the world is the following:
	"Location l1_1 is in city c1"
	... (other locations)
	"Package t1 is in location l1_4"
	"Package t2 is in location l2_1"
	"Package p1 is in location l2_3"
	"Package p2 is in location l1_5"
	"Package a1 is in location l1_1"
	"Package a2 is in location l2_1"

Wait, that's the problem. The user has incorrectly listed trucks and airplanes as packages. For example, "Package t1 is in location l1_4" â€” but t1 is a truck. So this must be an error. Because in the object list, they have "truck t1", "truck t2", "airplane a1", "airplane a2", etc. So the correct initial positions should be:

Truck t1 is at l1_4.

Truck t2 is at l2_1.

Airplane a1 is at l1_1.

Airplane a2 is at l2_1.

Packages p1 is at l2_3, p2 at l1_5.

So the user made a mistake in the original state, writing "Package t1" instead of "Truck t1". Similarly for others. So assuming that's a typo, we can proceed.

So the correct initial positions are:

- Truck t1 is at l1_4 (c1)
- Truck t2 is at l2_1 (c2)
- Airplane a1 is at l1_1 (c1)
- Airplane a2 is at l2_1 (c2)
- Package p1 is at l2_3 (c2)
- Package p2 is at l1_5 (c1)

Okay, that makes sense now. So t1 is a truck in c1 at l1_4. t2 is a truck in c2 at l2_1. a1 is in c1's airport l1_1, a2 in c2's airport l2_1.

So for moving p1 from l2_3 (c2) to l1_4 (c1):

1. In c2, move p1 to l2_1 (airport) using truck t2. But t2 is at l2_1. Wait, no. Wait, p1 is at l2_3. So we need to get t2 to l2_3. Wait, t2 is in l2_1. So drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_3 (same city c2). Then load p1 into t2. Then drive t2 back to l2_1. Then unload p1 into l2_1. Then load p1 into airplane a2. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1. Then unload p1 from a2 (but a2 is now in l1_1). Then load p1 into truck t1 (if t1 is at l1_1). But t1 is initially at l1_4. So we need to drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1, load p1, drive to l1_4, unload.

But along the way, we need to satisfy the constraints. Let's check the constraints again.

Constraints:

1. p1 must be in l1_1 at some state. So when we fly p1 to l1_1 via a2, that would be when we unload p1 from a2 into l1_1. So that satisfies the first part of constraint 1. Then, the condition that before that, p2 is in l1_1 or l2_3. Since p2 starts in l1_5, we need to have moved p2 to l1_1 before moving p1 to l1_1. Or have p2 in l2_3 (but p2 is in c1, so moving it to c2's l2_3 would require inter-city transport, which is possible but maybe more steps. Alternatively, move p2 to l1_1.

So maybe during the plan, first move p2 from l1_5 to l1_1 using truck t1. Because t1 is in l1_4. So drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_5, load p2, drive to l1_1, unload. Then p2 is in l1_1. Then, when we later move p1 to l1_1 (via airplane), the condition for constraint 1 is satisfied because p2 was in l1_1 before p1 is in l1_1.

But then, after that, we need to move p2 from l1_1 to l1_2 (the goal). So that's another step. But moving p2 from l1_1 to l1_2 would require driving t1 (since it's in l1_1 after unloading p2 there). So drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_2, unload p2. That's part of the plan.

So for p2's movement: l1_5 -> l1_1 (via t1), then l1_1 -> l1_2 (via t1). But then, we need to ensure that during the plan, the constraints related to p2 are met.

Constraint 2: At some state, p2 is in l1_5. Well, the initial state satisfies that. But then, when p2 is in l1_5 (initially), the conditional says that in that state or after, either p1 is in l2_2 or p2 is in l1_4. So after the initial state (s0), we need to have either p1 in l2_2 or p2 in l1_4. But the initial state is s0, and in s0, p2 is in l1_5. So the constraint requires that in s0 or any state after, either p1 is in l2_2 or p2 in l1_4.

But the initial state of p1 is l2_3. So unless we move p1 to l2_2, or move p2 to l1_4, the constraint is violated. Wait, but the constraint says that if in a state s, p2 is in l1_5, then in s or some state after, either p1 in l2_2 or p2 in l1_4. So since p2 starts in l1_5 (s0), then we must ensure that in s0 or a later state, p1 is in l2_2 or p2 is in l1_4. So we can satisfy this by moving p2 to l1_4 after s0, which would happen when we move p2 from l1_5 to l1_4 (but in our current plan, we're moving p2 to l1_1 first). Wait, but that's not part of the current plan. Hmm, this might be a problem.

Wait, in the initial plan I thought of moving p2 from l1_5 to l1_1 via t1, but that would leave p2 in l1_1. But according to constraint 2, when p2 is in l1_5 (initially), after that, we need to have either p1 in l2_2 or p2 in l1_4. So in the initial state (s0), p2 is in l1_5, so we need to ensure that in s0 or later, either p1 is in l2_2 or p2 is in l1_4. So after s0, if we move p2 to l1_4, that would satisfy it. But in our current plan, we're moving p2 to l1_1. So perhaps we need to adjust the plan to first move p2 to l1_4, then to l1_1, but that complicates things.

Alternatively, we can move p1 to l2_2. But p1 starts in l2_3 (c2). To get to l2_2, which is in the same city (c2), we can use truck t2. So truck t2 is at l2_1. Drive t2 to l2_3, load p1, drive to l2_2, unload p1. That would satisfy the constraint for when p2 is in l1_5 (s0) because now in a later state, p1 is in l2_2.

But this adds extra steps. Let's see:

For constraint 2: The initial state s0 has p2 in l1_5. So in s0 or after, either p1 is in l2_2 or p2 in l1_4. So if we move p1 to l2_2, that satisfies it. Then proceed to move p1 from l2_2 to l2_1, etc. But how does this affect the rest of the plan?

Alternatively, moving p2 from l1_5 to l1_4 first would also satisfy the constraint. So:

Drive t1 (which is at l1_4) to l1_5, load p2, drive back to l1_4, unload p2. Now p2 is in l1_4. Then, since the constraint is satisfied (because after s0, p2 is in l1_4), we can proceed. Then, we can move p2 from l1_4 to l1_2 via t1 (drive to l1_2, unload). But the goal is to have p2 in l1_2, so that's part of the plan. But this way, during the plan, p2 is in l1_4, which is required for the goal (p1 in l1_4). Wait, no, the goal is p1 in l1_4 and p2 in l1_2. So moving p2 to l1_4 first and then to l1_2 is possible. But then, after moving p2 to l1_4, the constraint 2 is satisfied. Then, moving p2 to l1_2 would be after that.

But this approach may help. Let's outline this:

For p2:

1. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_5 (same city c1)
2. Load p2 into t1 at l1_5
3. Drive t1 to l1_4, unload p2. Now p2 is in l1_4. (This satisfies constraint 2, because after s0, p2 is in l1_4)
4. Then, drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_2 (same city), unload p2. Now p2 is in l1_2 (goal achieved).

But wait, the goal is p2 in l1_2. So step 4 would achieve that.

But then, how does this interact with the other constraints?

Looking at constraint 4: If p1 is in l2_1 at any state, then p2 must be in l2_5 at or after that state. So we need to ensure that if during the plan, p1 is moved to l2_1 (airport of c2), then p2 must end up in l2_5 (which is in c2). But our goal is p2 in l1_2. So we must avoid having p1 in l2_1 unless we also move p2 to l2_5, which conflicts with the goal. Therefore, we need to ensure that p1 never goes to l2_1, or if it does, then p2 is moved to l2_5 afterwards, but that's conflicting with the goal. Therefore, we must avoid moving p1 to l2_1. But wait, the constraint says that the following must hold in at least one state: "Package p1 is in location l2_1". So we have to have p1 in l2_1 at some point. Which is a problem because then we have to move p2 to l2_5, which is in c2, but the goal is to have p2 in l1_2 (c1). So how to resolve this?

Wait, the constraints:

Constraint 4: If p1 is in l2_1 in some state s, then p2 must be in l2_5 at s or after.

But the goal requires p2 to be in l1_2, which is in c1. So if p2 is moved to l2_5 (c2), we need to move it back to c1, which requires using an airplane, but that would complicate the plan. So perhaps the solution is to have p1 pass through l2_1, then ensure that p2 is moved to l2_5, but then move p2 back. But that's a lot of steps. Let's see.

So constraint 4 requires that p1 must be in l2_1 at some state. So during the plan, we need to have p1 in l2_1. And then, after that, p2 must be in l2_5.

But the goal is p2 in l1_2. So after moving p2 to l2_5, we need to get it back to c1. Which requires using an airplane. For example, load p2 into a truck in l2_5, drive to l2_1 (airport), load into a2, fly to l1_1, unload, then truck to l1_2. But this adds many steps.

Alternatively, find a way to satisfy the constraint without conflicting with the goal. Maybe the p1 is in l2_1 after p2 is already in l1_2. But then, the constraint says that if p1 is in l2_1 at state s, then p2 must be in l2_5 at s or after. So if p2 is already in l1_2 (the goal), then after s, we have to move p2 from l1_2 to l2_5, which contradicts the goal. Therefore, this seems impossible. Therefore, the plan must have p1 in l2_1 before p2 is moved to l1_2. So when p1 is in l2_1, we must then move p2 to l2_5, then move p2 back to c1. But this complicates the plan.

Alternatively, maybe the plan can have p1 in l2_1 at a certain point, and then p2 is moved to l2_5 after that. But how to get p2 to l2_5? p2 is in c1 initially. So to get p2 to l2_5 (c2), we need to transport it via airplane. For example:

After moving p2 to l1_1 (as part of satisfying constraint 1), load p2 into a1, fly to l2_1 (c2's airport), unload, then use truck t2 to drive to l2_5. Then, after that, move p2 back to c1 to reach l1_2. But this adds many steps.

This seems very complicated. Maybe I'm missing a smarter way.

Let's recap the constraints:

Constraint 1: p1 must be in l1_1 at some state, and before that, p2 must be in l1_1 or l2_3.

Constraint 4: p1 must be in l2_1 at some state, and after that, p2 must be in l2_5.

Constraint 7: p1 must be in l1_3 at some state.

Other constraints:

Constraint 3: p1 is in l1_5 or in a1 at some state.

Constraint 5: p1 is in l1_5 or in a1.

Constraint 6: p1 is in l2_1.

Constraint 7: p1 is in l1_3.

So how to satisfy all these?

Let me try to outline a possible plan step by step, considering all constraints.

First, for p1's movement from l2_3 to l1_4:

1. In c2, truck t2 is at l2_1. Drive t2 to l2_3.
2. Load p1 into t2 at l2_3.
3. Drive t2 back to l2_1.
4. Unload p1 into l2_1. (Now p1 is in l2_1, satisfying constraint 6)
   - But after this, constraint 4 requires that p2 must be in l2_5 at or after this state. So after step 4 (p1 in l2_1), we need to move p2 to l2_5.
   - But p2 is initially in l1_5 (c1). To move p2 to l2_5 (c2), we need to transport it via airplane.

So steps for p2:

a. In c1, truck t1 is at l1_4. Drive t1 to l1_5.
b. Load p2 into t1.
c. Drive t1 to l1_1 (airport of c1).
d. Unload p2 into l1_1.
e. Load p2 into airplane a1.
f. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1 (c2's airport).
g. Unload p2 into l2_1.
h. Load p2 into truck t2 (which is at l2_1).
i. Drive t2 to l2_5.
j. Unload p2 into l2_5. (Satisfies constraint 4 after p1 was in l2_1)
   - Now p2 is in l2_5. But the goal is to have p2 in l1_2. So need to move it back.

k. Load p2 into truck t2 at l2_5.
l. Drive t2 to l2_1.
m. Unload p2 into l2_1.
n. Load p2 into airplane a2.
o. Fly a2 to l1_1.
p. Unload p2 into l1_1.
q. Load p2 into truck t1 (which needs to be at l1_1).
   - So after step d, t1 is at l1_1. Wait, in step c, t1 is driven to l1_1 and left there after unloading p2. So yes.
r. Drive t1 to l1_2.
s. Unload p2 into l1_2 (achieving the goal).

But this seems very long. Let's check if all constraints are met.

Now, let's check each constraint:

Constraint 1: p1 must be in l1_1 at some state. But in the current steps, p1 is moved from l2_1 (after step 4) to l2_1, then needs to be flown to l1_1. Wait, after step 4, p1 is in l2_1. Then, we need to get p1 to l1_1. So steps after step 4:

5. Load p1 into airplane a2 (at l2_1).
6. Fly a2 to l1_1.
7. Unload p1 into l1_1. (Now p1 is in l1_1, satisfying constraint 1)
   - Before this, p2 must have been in l1_1 or l2_3. When did p2 get to l1_1? In step d, p2 is unloaded into l1_1. Then in step e, loaded into a1. So during step d, p2 is in l1_1. So before p1 is in l1_1 (step 7), p2 was in l1_1 (step d). Which meets the condition for constraint 1.

Constraint 2: p2 is in l1_5 initially (s0), so we need that after s0, either p1 in l2_2 or p2 in l1_4. In the plan, after s0, we first move p1 to l2_1 (step 4). But that's not l2_2. Then, after moving p2 to l1_1 (step d), then to l2_5 (step j). But where does p2 get to l1_4? In the current plan, p2 is moved from l1_5 to l1_1, not l1_4. So this would violate constraint 2 unless p1 is moved to l2_2.

Ah, right. So in the current plan, after s0 (p2 in l1_5), we need to have either p1 in l2_2 or p2 in l1_4. But in the current steps, p1 is moved to l2_1 (step 4), which doesn't satisfy l2_2. And p2 is moved to l1_1 (step d), not l1_4. So constraint 2 is not satisfied. Therefore, this plan is invalid.

So to satisfy constraint 2, after p2 is in l1_5 (initial state), we need to have either p1 in l2_2 or p2 in l1_4 at some point. In the current steps, neither happens. So we need to adjust the plan.

Option 1: Move p1 to l2_2. So in c2, after step 3 (t2 is at l2_1 with p1), drive t2 to l2_2 and unload p1. Then p1 is in l2_2, satisfying constraint 2. Then proceed to load p1 back into t2, drive to l2_1, and continue.

But this adds steps. Let's see:

Adjusting the steps for p1:

1. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_3.
2. Load p1 into t2.
3. Drive t2 to l2_2. (Instead of l2_1)
4. Unload p1 into l2_2. (Satisfies constraint 2)
5. Load p1 into t2 again.
6. Drive t2 to l2_1.
7. Unload p1 into l2_1. (Now constraint 6 is met)
   - Then proceed with the rest.

This way, after s0 (p2 in l1_5), p1 is moved to l2_2 (step 4), which satisfies constraint 2.

But this adds steps, but it's necessary.

Now, proceeding with the rest:

8. Load p1 into airplane a2 at l2_1.
9. Fly a2 to l1_1.
10. Unload p1 into l1_1. (Constraint 1 satisfied)
    - Before this, p2 was in l1_1 (step d), so constraint 1's antecedent is met.

Now, the steps for p2:

a. Drive t1 to l1_5.
b. Load p2.
c. Drive t1 to l1_1.
d. Unload p2 into l1_1. (This is before step 10)
e. Load p2 into a1.
f. Fly a1 to l2_1.
g. Unload p2 into l2_1.
h. Load p2 into t2.
i. Drive t2 to l2_5.
j. Unload p2 into l2_5. (Satisfies constraint 4)
k. Load p2 back into t2.
l. Drive to l2_1.
m. Unload p2.
n. Load into a2.
o. Fly to l1_1.
p. Unload p2 into l1_1.
q. Load into t1 (which is at l1_1).
r. Drive to l1_2.
s. Unload p2. (Goal achieved)

But this is getting very long. Let's check other constraints.

Constraint 3: p2 must be in l1_5 at some state. The initial state is s0, so that's satisfied.

Constraint 5: At some state, p1 is in l1_5 or in a1. In our current plan, p1 is never in l1_5. It's loaded into a2 (step 8) and then into a1? No. Let's see:

After step 10, p1 is in l1_1 (unloaded from a2). Then, to get to l1_4, perhaps load into t1:

11. Load p1 into t1 at l1_1.
12. Drive t1 to l1_4.
13. Unload p1. (Goal achieved)

But step 11: When is t1 available? t1 was used to move p2 to l1_1 (step c), then to l1_2 (step r). So during the p2 steps, t1 is moving around. So the steps for p1 and p2 are interleaved.

This is getting really complicated. Let me try to outline a chronological plan with all steps, ensuring constraints are met.

Possible steps:

For p2's initial movement to satisfy constraint 2:

1. In c1, drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_5.
2. Load p2 into t1 at l1_5.
3. Drive t1 to l1_4. (Now p2 is in l1_4, satisfying constraint 2's requirement after s0)
   - This takes care of constraint 2.

For p1's movement in c2:

4. In c2, drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_3.
5. Load p1 into t2.
6. Drive t2 to l2_2 and unload p1. (Satisfies constraint 2's p1 in l2_2)
7. Load p1 into t2 again.
8. Drive t2 to l2_1.
9. Unload p1 into l2_1. (Satisfies constraint 6)
   - Now, after this, we must move p2 to l2_5.

For moving p2 to l2_5:

10. In c1, drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1 (airport) [t1 was at l1_4 after step 3]
11. Unload p2 into l1_1. (Now p2 is in l1_1)
12. Load p2 into a1.
13. Fly a1 to l2_1.
14. Unload p2 into l2_1.
15. Load p2 into t2 (which is at l2_1).
16. Drive t2 to l2_5.
17. Unload p2 into l2_5. (Satisfies constraint 4)
   - Now, need to move p2 back to c1 for the goal.

For moving p2 back to c1:

18. Load p2 into t2 at l2_5.
19. Drive t2 to l2_1.
20. Unload p2 into l2_1.
21. Load p2 into a2.
22. Fly a2 to l1_1.
23. Unload p2 into l1_1.
24. Load p2 into t1 (at l1_1).
25. Drive t1 to l1_2.
26. Unload p2. (Goal achieved for p2)

For p1's movement to l1_4:

27. Load p1 into a2 at l2_1 (but a2 is at l2_1 after step 21? No, a2 was used to fly p2 to l1_1 in step 22. So after step 22, a2 is at l1_1. Wait, this is getting too tangled.

Alternatively, after step 9 (p1 in l2_1), load p1 into a2.

10. Load p1 into a2 at l2_1.
11. Fly a2 to l1_1.
12. Unload p1 into l1_1. (Satisfies constraint 1)
   - Before this, p2 was in l1_1 (step 11). So step 11 happens before step 12.

But after step 11, p2 is loaded into a1 (step 12) and flown to l2_1 (step 13).

But this is getting very convoluted. I'm starting to think that this approach is too time-consuming and error-prone. Maybe there's a smarter way to handle the constraints without moving p2 to c2.

Let me try to find a different approach.

Alternative Plan:

Let's handle constraint 4 (p1 must be in l2_1, which requires p2 to be in l2_5 after). Since this is the most problematic, let's see if we can move p1 to l2_1 early and then move p2 to l2_5, but then have p2 return to c1.

But given the steps required, maybe it's unavoidable.

Let's try to outline a plan that satisfies all constraints step by step.

1. Move p2 from l1_5 to l1_4 using t1 (to satisfy constraint 2):
   - Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_5.
   - Load p2.
   - Drive back to l1_4 and unload. Now p2 is in l1_4.

2. Move p1 to l2_2 in c2 to satisfy constraint 2 (but already done via step 1). Wait, step 1 already satisfies constraint 2 by moving p2 to l1_4. So no need to move p1 to l2_2. But maybe we need to do both to satisfy other constraints. Let me see.

Constraint 2 is satisfied because after s0 (p2 in l1_5), p2 is moved to l1_4, so in state after step 1, constraint 2 is met.

Next, handle constraint 6 (p1 in l2_1):

3. In c2, drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_3.
4. Load p1 into t2.
5. Drive t2 to l2_1.
6. Unload p1 into l2_1. (Now p1 is in l2_1, satisfying constraint 6)
   - Now, need to move p2 to l2_5 after this.

7. Move p2 from l1_4 to l1_1 (using t1):
   - Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1.
   - Load p2 into t1 (p2 is in l1_4, so this step is not possible unless p2 is in the same location as t1. Wait, p2 is in l1_4, and t1 is at l1_4 after step 1. So:

7. Load p2 into t1 at l1_4.
8. Drive t1 to l1_1.
9. Unload p2 into l1_1. (Now p2 is in l1_1)

10. Load p2 into a1 at l1_1.
11. Fly a1 to l2_1.
12. Unload p2 into l2_1.
13. Load p2 into t2 (which is at l2_1).
14. Drive t2 to l2_5.
15. Unload p2 into l2_5. (Satisfies constraint 4)

Now, p2 is in l2_5. Need to move it back to c1 for the goal.

16. Load p2 into t2 at l2_5.
17. Drive t2 to l2_1.
18. Unload p2 into l2_1.
19. Load p2 into a2.
20. Fly a2 to l1_1.
21. Unload p2 into l1_1.
22. Load p2 into t1 (at l1_1).
23. Drive t1 to l1_2.
24. Unload p2. (Goal achieved for p2)

For p1, after step 6 (p1 in l2_1):

25. Load p1 into a2 (at l2_1).
26. Fly a2 to l1_1. (But a2 is used to move p2, so need to check timing. After step 19, a2 is at l2_1. So after step 19, fly a2 to l1_1 with p1.

Wait, step 25 would require a2 to be at l2_1. After step 19, a2 is at l2_1 (after loading p2 into a2 and flying to l1_1 in step 20). No, step 19 is load p2 into a2 at l2_1, then fly to l1_1 (step 20). So a2 is at l1_1 after step 20. So to move p1 from l2_1 to l1_1, need to use a different airplane. Wait, there are two airplanes: a1 and a2. a1 is initially at l1_1, and a2 at l2_1.

So after step 11, a1 is at l2_1. Then, after step 13, a2 is still at l2_1. So after step 6 (p1 in l2_1), load p1 into a2 (at l2_1), fly to l1_1.

25. Load p1 into a2 at l2_1.
26. Fly a2 to l1_1.
27. Unload p1 into l1_1. (Satisfies constraint 1)
   - Before this, p2 was in l1_1 (step 9), which satisfies constraint 1's antecedent.

Then, move p1 from l1_1 to l1_4:

28. Load p1 into t1 (at l1_1 after step 9).
29. Drive t1 to l1_4.
30. Unload p1. (Goal achieved for p1)

Additionally, need to handle other constraints:

Constraint 3: p1 must be in l1_5 or in a1. In this plan, p1 is never in l1_5. So need to have p1 in a1 at some point. When? For example, after step 27, p1 is in l1_1. Load p1 into a1.

But a1 is at l2_1 after step 11. Hmm, this is a problem. After step 11, a1 flew to l2_1 and is there. So to load p1 into a1, we need a1 to be in l1_1. Alternatively, after step 27, p1 is in l1_1. If a1 is in l1_1 at that time, then load p1 into a1.

Wait, a1's initial location is l1_1. So in step 10, a1 is loaded with p2 and flown to l2_1 (step 11). Then, after step 11, a1 is in l2_1. So to get a1 back to l1_1, need to fly it back.

But this adds more steps. For example, after step 11:

12. Fly a1 from l2_1 to l1_1. (Empty flight)
13. Load p1 into a1.
14. Fly a1 to l1_1. (Not needed, as it's already there)

But this is just loading p1 into a1 at l1_1, which would satisfy constraint 3.

Alternatively, after step 27, p1 is in l1_1. Load p1 into a1 (which is back at l1_1 after some flight). Let's see:

After step 11, a1 is at l2_1. To get it back to l1_1:

12. Fly a1 from l2_1 to l1_1 (empty).
Then, after step 27, load p1 into a1.

But this adds steps. For constraint 3, which requires p1 to be in a1 or l1_5 at some state. So loading p1 into a1 at any point would satisfy it.

In the current plan, after step 27 (p1 in l1_1), if we load p1 into a1 (which is in l1_1), then fly a1 somewhere else, but this isn't necessary. Just loading and then unloading would suffice. But this would add steps.

Alternatively, during p1's movement, perhaps use a1 to transport it.

But this is getting too complex. Maybe there's a way to satisfy constraint 3 by having p1 loaded into a1 during its transportation.

For example, after p1 is in l1_1 (step 27), load into a1 (which is there), then fly to l1_4's airport? No, l1_4 is not an airport. So we need to use a truck.

Alternatively, load p1 into a1 at l1_1 (satisfying constraint 3), then unload and load into truck.

This adds:

28. Load p1 into a1 at l1_1. (Satisfies constraint 3)
29. Unload p1 into l1_1.
30. Load into t1.
31. Drive to l1_4.
32. Unload. (Goal)

But this adds steps. But necessary to satisfy constraint 3.

Finally, constraint 7: p1 must be in l1_3 at some state. So during the plan, p1 must pass through l1_3. So when moving p1 from l1_1 to l1_4, drive t1 through l1_3.

For example:

After step 30 (loading p1 into t1 at l1_1), drive t1 to l1_3, then to l1_4.

Steps:

30. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_3. (p1 is in t1)
31. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_4.
32. Unload p1. (Goal)

This way, p1 is in l1_3 during step 30-31 (inside t1?), but the location of p1 is l1_3 when t1 is there. Wait, no. When you unload, the package is in the location. So to have p1 in l1_3, we need to unload it there.

So adjust steps:

28. Load p1 into t1 at l1_1.
29. Drive t1 to l1_3.
30. Unload p1 into l1_3. (Satisfies constraint 7)
31. Load p1 into t1.
32. Drive to l1_4.
33. Unload. (Goal)

This adds steps but satisfies constraint 7.

Now, putting it all together, the steps would be extensive, but let's try to list them in order:

1. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_5. (c1)
2. Load p2 into t1 at l1_5.
3. Drive t1 to l1_4.
4. Unload p2 into l1_4. (Constraint 2 met)
5. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_3. (c2)
6. Load p1 into t2.
7. Drive t2 to l2_1.
8. Unload p1 into l2_1. (Constraint 6 met)
9. Load p2 into t1 at l1_4.
10. Drive t1 to l1_1.
11. Unload p2 into l1_1.
12. Load p2 into a1 at l1_1.
13. Fly a1 to l2_1.
14. Unload p2 into l2_1.
15. Load p2 into t2 at l2_1.
16. Drive t2 to l2_5.
17. Unload p2 into l2_5. (Constraint 4 met)
18. Load p2 into t2.
19. Drive t2 to l2_1.
20. Unload p2 into l2_1.
21. Load p2 into a2 at l2_1.
22. Fly a2 to l1_1.
23. Unload p2 into l1_1.
24. Load p2 into t1 at l1_1.
25. Drive t1 to l1_2.
26. Unload p2. (Goal for p2)
27. Load p1 into a2 at l2_1.
28. Fly a2 to l1_1.
29. Unload p1 into l1_1. (Constraint 1 met)
30. Load p1 into a1 at l1_1. (Assuming a1 is back here, but earlier steps used a1 to fly to l2_1. So maybe a1 is still at l2_1. So need to fly a1 back.)
   - Assuming a1 is at l2_1 after step 13, need to fly it back:
   - 30. Fly a1 from l2_1 to l1_1.
31. Load p1 into a1 at l1_1. (Constraint 3 met)
32. Unload p1 into l1_1.
33. Load p1 into t1.
34. Drive t1 to l1_3.
35. Unload p1 into l1_3. (Constraint 7 met)
36. Load p1 into t1.
37. Drive t1 to l1_4.
38. Unload p1. (Goal for p1)

This plan is very long and likely not optimal. Also, there might be redundant steps. But given the complexity of the constraints, it's challenging to find a shorter plan. However, the user requires an optimal plan with minimal steps. Let's see if we can optimize.

Alternative approach: Find a way to satisfy multiple constraints with fewer steps.

For example, constraint 3 requires p1 to be in a1 or l1_5. If we can have p1 loaded into a1 during transportation, that would satisfy it.

Similarly, constraint 7 requires p1 to be in l1_3. Maybe when moving p1 from l1_1 to l1_4, pass through l1_3.

But let's think differently. Maybe using a different order.

Plan Outline:

1. Move p2 from l1_5 to l1_4 using t1. (Satisfy constraint 2)
2. Move p1 from l2_3 to l2_2 using t2. (Satisfy constraint 2)
3. Move p1 from l2_2 to l2_1 using t2. (To later fly)
4. Load p1 into a2 and fly to l1_1. (Satisfy constraint 1)
   - Before this, move p2 to l1_1 to satisfy constraint 1's antecedent.
5. Move p2 from l1_4 to l1_1 using t1. (Satisfy antecedent)
6. Load p1 into a1. (Satisfy constraint 3)
7. Unload p1 into l1_1, then load into t1 and drive to l1_3. (Satisfy constraint 7)
8. Drive to l1_4 and unload. (Goal)
9. For constraint 4: After p1 is in l2_1 (step 3), move p2 to l2_5.
   - This requires transporting p2 from l1_1 to l2_5 via airplane and truck.

But this seems possible but complex. Let's try:

Steps:

1. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_5.
2. Load p2.
3. Drive t1 to l1_4. Unload. (Constraint 2 met)
4. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_3.
5. Load p1.
6. Drive t2 to l2_2. Unload. (Constraint 2 met)
7. Load p1 into t2.
8. Drive to l2_1. Unload. (p1 in l2_1, constraint 6 met)
9. Load p1 into a2.
10. Fly a2 to l1_1. Unload. (p1 in l1_1, constraint 1 met)
   - Before this, ensure p2 is in l1_1 or l2_3. Since p2 is in l1_4 (step 3), need to move p2 to l1_1 before step 10.
11. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1. (t1 is at l1_4 after step 3)
12. Load p2 into t1 (but p2 is in l1_4, which is where t1 was before driving to l1_1. Wait, after step 3, p2 is in l1_4. So t1 is at l1_4. To load p2 into t1 at l1_4:

11. Load p2 into t1 at l1_4.
12. Drive t1 to l1_1.
13. Unload p2 into l1_1. (Now p2 is in l1_1, satisfying constraint 1's antecedent)
14. Proceed with steps 9-10: p1 is flown to l1_1.
15. Load p1 into a1 (which is at l1_1). (Satisfy constraint 3)
16. Unload p1 into l1_1.
17. Load p1 into t1.
18. Drive t1 to l1_3. Unload. (Constraint 7 met)
19. Load p1 into t1.
20. Drive to l1_4. Unload. (Goal for p1)
21. Now, for constraint 4: After step 8 (p1 in l2_1), move p2 to l2_5.
   - p2 is in l1_1 (step 13). So need to move p2 from l1_1 to l2_5.
   - Load p2 into a1 at l1_1.
   - Fly a1 to l2_1.
   - Unload p2.
   - Load into t2.
   - Drive to l2_5.
   - Unload. (Constraint 4 met)
22. Then move p2 back to c1:
   - Load into t2, drive to l2_1.
   - Load into a2.
   - Fly to l1_1.
   - Unload.
   - Load into t1.
   - Drive to l1_2.
   - Unload. (Goal for p2)

This plan still has many steps but is more optimized. Let's count the steps and see if all constraints are met.

Constraints Check:

1. p1 in l1_1 (step 10) - yes.
   - Before that, p2 in l1_1 (step 13) - yes.

2. p2 in l1_5 initially. After that, p2 moved to l1_4 (step 3) - yes.

3. p1 in a1 (step 15) - yes.

4. p1 in l2_1 (step 8) - yes. Then p2 moved to l2_5 (step 21).

5. p1 in l1_3 (step 18) - yes.

6. p1 in l2_1 (step 8) - yes.

7. p1 in l1_3 (step 18) - yes.

This plan satisfies all constraints and achieves the goal. Now, let's write the actual action sequence.

Final Action Plan:

```
```
1. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1
2. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
3. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1
4. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
5. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
6. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
7. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2
8. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
9. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
10. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
11. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
12. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
13. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
14. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
15. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
16. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
17. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
18. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
19. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
20. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
21. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
22. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
23. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
24. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1
25. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
26. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
27. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
28. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
29. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
30. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
31. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
32. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
33. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
34. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
35. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
36. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
37. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
38. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
39. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
40. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
```
```

But this has 40 steps, which is definitely not optimal. There must be a smarter way to interleave actions to minimize steps. For example, moving p2 to l2_5 while p1 is being moved.

Alternatively, perhaps using a1 to carry p1 to l1_1, satisfying constraint 3 and 1 in one move.

Let me try a more optimal approach:

1. Move p2 from l1_5 to l1_4 (constraint 2):
   - drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1
   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
   - drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1
   - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

2. Move p1 from l2_3 to l2_1 via t2:
   - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
   - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
   - drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
   - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (constraint 6 met)

3. Fly p1 to l1_1 using a2:
   - loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
   - flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
   - unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (constraint 1 met, and p1 is in a2 during flight, but constraint 3 requires p1 in a1 or l1_5. Not yet met.)

4. Move p2 from l1_4 to l1_1 using t1:
   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
   - drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
   - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (now p2 is in l1_1, which was before p1 in l1_1? No, steps 3 and 4 are concurrent. Need to adjust order.)

Actually, step 3's unload is after step 4's unload. So:

To satisfy constraint 1's antecedent (p2 in l1_1 before p1 in l1_1), we need to have p2 in l1_1 before step 3's unload.

So adjust:

1. Move p2 to l1_4.
2. Move p2 from l1_4 to l1_1:
   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
   - drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
   - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (now p2 in l1_1)
3. Move p1 to l2_1 and fly to l1_1:
   - ... (steps for p1)
   - unload p1 into l1_1 (now p1 is in l1_1, after p2 was there)

Then, load p1 into a1 to satisfy constraint 3.

Continuing:

4. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (now p1 is in a1, satisfying constraint 3)
5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l1_1 (no move, but just to unload)
   - unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

6. Then move p1 to l1_3 and l1_4.

But this approach might work. Let's outline:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1
2. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
3. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1
4. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
5. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
6. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
7. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
8. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
9. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
10. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
11. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
12. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
13. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
14. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
15. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (constraint 3)
16. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l1_1 (no-op, just to unload)
17. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
18. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
19. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
20. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (constraint 7)
21. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
22. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1
23. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4 (goal for p1)
24. Now handle constraint 4: p1 was in l2_1 (step 11), so need p2 in l2_5 after.
   - p2 is in l1_1. Need to move to l2_5.
25. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
26. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
27. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
28. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
29. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
30. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 (constraint 4)
31. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
32. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
33. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
34. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
35. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
36. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
37. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
38. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
39. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (goal for p2)

This still has 39 steps. It's clear that the constraints make the plan very long. However, given the problem's complexity, it's challenging to find a shorter plan without violating any constraints. 

But perhaps there's a way to combine steps. For example, when moving p2 to l2_5, maybe combine with moving p1.

Alternatively, after step 11 (p1 in l2_1), load p1 into a2 and fly to l1_1, but also move p2 to l2_5 in parallel.

But this requires careful interleaving. Let's try to optimize:

Steps:

1. Move p2 to l1_4 (steps 1-4).
2. Move p1 to l2_1 (steps 8-11).
3. Load p1 into a2 and fly to l1_1 (steps 12-14).
4. Now p1 is in l1_1. Load into a1 (step 15) to satisfy constraint 3.
5. Unload p1 and move to l1_3 and l1_4.
6. Simultaneously, move p2 from l1_1 to l2_5 (steps 25-30).
7. Move p2 back to c1.

But even with this, the steps are numerous.

Given the time constraints and the complexity, I'll proceed to write the plan with the minimal steps I can think of, ensuring all constraints are met. The optimal plan may require further optimization, but due to the problem's complexity, this is challenging.
