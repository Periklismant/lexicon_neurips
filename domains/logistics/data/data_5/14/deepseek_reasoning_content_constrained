Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. Hmm, the goal is to get p1 to l2_5 and p2 to l1_2. Plus, there are several constraints that must be met along the way. Let me break this down step by step.

First, let's look at the initial state. Packages: p1 is in l2_3 (city c2), p2 is in l1_1 (city c1, which is the airport). Trucks t1 is in l1_2 (c1), t2 in l2_4 (c2). Airplanes a1 in l1_1 (c1's airport), a2 in l2_1 (c2's airport). 

The constraints are a bit complex. Let me list them:

1. At some point, p2 must be in a2 and p1 in l1_2.
2. p2 must be in l2_3.
3. p2 must be in l1_2 (which is the goal, but also a constraint).
4. If p2 is in l1_2 (which is the goal), then before that, p1 must have been in l2_1 or l1_5.
5. p2 must be in a1.
6. p2 must be in l1_4.

So, the plan must include actions that satisfy all these constraints while achieving the final goals.

Starting with p2. Since p2 starts at l1_1 (an airport in c1), which is where a1 is. To get p2 to l1_2, which is in c1. Maybe use truck t1, which is already at l1_2. Wait, but t1 is in l1_2, so to load p2 into t1, p2 needs to be in the same location as t1. But p2 is in l1_1. So how to get p2 to l1_2?

Wait, the initial position of t1 is l1_2. So t1 is in c1, locations l1_2. To move t1, we can drive it to other locations in c1. But p2 is in l1_1 (the airport). So perhaps we need to use airplane a1 to move p2 somewhere else first. Wait, but a1 is in l1_1. So maybe load p2 into a1, fly to another airport, then unload, then use a truck?

But the goal is to get p2 back to l1_2. Let's see. Also, the constraints require p2 to be in a2 (which is in c2's airport l2_1), l2_3 (c2), l1_4 (c1), and a1. So p2 has to move around a lot.

For p1, which is in l2_3 (c2). The goal is l2_5 (c2). So maybe use truck t2, which is in l2_4. Drive t2 to l2_3, load p1, drive to l2_5, unload. But let's check constraints. The first constraint requires p1 to be in l1_2 at some point. Wait, but l1_2 is in c1, and p1 starts in c2. So how does p1 get to l1_2? That would require flying p1 from c2 to c1. So load p1 into airplane a2 (which is at l2_1, c2's airport). But p1 is in l2_3. So first, use a truck to move p1 to l2_1 (the airport). Then fly to c1's airport l1_1. Then unload and move to l1_2.

But the constraint also says that in some state, p2 is in a2. So a2 is in l2_1. So to get p2 into a2, we need to have p2 transported to c2's airport, loaded into a2. Then perhaps unload it again. But how?

This is getting complicated. Let's outline possible steps for both packages.

For p2's journey:

Start at l1_1 (c1). Need to get to l1_2. But along the way, must visit a1 (so load into a1), then perhaps fly to another location? Wait, a1 is already at l1_1. So maybe load p2 into a1, then fly a1 to another airport, like l2_1 (c2's airport). Then unload p2 there. Then maybe load into a2 (but why?), but the constraint requires p2 to be in a2. So perhaps after flying a1 to l2_1, unload p2 into a2. Wait, no. To load into a2, both p2 and a2 need to be at the same location. If a2 is in l2_1, then p2 can be unloaded from a1 into l2_1, then loaded into a2. Then, perhaps fly a2 somewhere else, but then we need to get p2 back to c1's l1_2.

But this seems like a lot of steps. Let's think.

p2's required states:

- Must be in a2 (so loaded into a2)
- Must be in l2_3 (c2)
- Must be in l1_4 (c1)
- Must be in l1_2 (goal)
- Also, in a1.

So possible steps:

1. Load p2 into a1 at l1_1 (since both are there). Then fly a1 to l2_1 (c2's airport). Now p2 is in a1, but when we unload, p2 is at l2_1. Then load into a2 (which is at l2_1). Now p2 is in a2. That satisfies the first constraint (p2 in a2 and p1 in l1_2? Wait, no, because p1 is still in l2_3. So maybe we need to handle p1's movement first.)

Wait, the first constraint requires that in some state, both p2 is in a2 and p1 is in l1_2. So both conditions must be true at the same time. So we need to arrange for both to be true at the same time. That complicates things.

Let's think about p1. To get p1 to l1_2 (c1), which is in another city. So p1 has to be flown from c2 to c1. So steps for p1:

p1 starts at l2_3 (c2). Need to get to l1_2 (c1). So:

- Drive truck t2 (which is at l2_4) to l2_3 (same city c2), load p1 into t2.

- Drive t2 to l2_1 (the airport in c2). Unload p1 at l2_1.

- Load p1 into airplane a2 (since a2 is at l2_1). Fly a2 to l1_1 (c1's airport). Unload p1 at l1_1.

- Then load p1 into a truck in c1. The available truck is t1, which is at l1_2. So drive t1 to l1_1, load p1, drive back to l1_2, unload. That would place p1 in l1_2, satisfying the first part of the first constraint.

But during this process, we can also have p2 in a2. Let's see. When a2 is flying from l2_1 to l1_1, if p2 is in a2, that could work. So perhaps:

For p2:

- Start at l1_1. Load into a1. Fly a1 to l2_1. Unload p2 into l2_1. Then load p2 into a2. Then fly a2 to l1_1. Then unload p2 into l1_1. Then load into truck t1 and drive to l1_2. But that may not hit all the constraints.

Wait, the constraints also require p2 to be in l2_3. So how? l2_3 is in c2. So perhaps after p2 is in l2_1 (airport), load into a truck in c2. But the only truck in c2 is t2. So drive t2 to l2_1, load p2, drive to l2_3, unload. Then p2 is in l2_3. Then perhaps load back into t2, drive to l2_1, load into a2 again, fly to c1, etc.

This is getting very involved. Let's try to map out all the required steps.

Let me start with the constraints and see which ones can be satisfied in the process.

Constraints:

1. At some state: p2 in a2 AND p1 in l1_2.

2. p2 in l2_3.

3. p2 in l1_2 (goal, already needed).

4. If p2 is in l1_2, then prior state must have p1 in l2_1 or l1_5.

5. p2 in a1.

6. p2 in l1_4.

So let's see:

- For constraint 5: p2 must be in a1. So at some point, load p2 into a1. Since a1 starts in l1_1, and p2 is also there, that's easy. Just load p2 into a1.

- For constraint 6: p2 must be in l1_4. So after possibly being in a1, p2 needs to get to l1_4. Since l1_4 is in c1, maybe unload from a truck that drove there.

- Constraint 2: p2 in l2_3. So need to get p2 to l2_3 in c2. That would require transporting p2 to c2, then via truck t2 to l2_3.

- Constraint 1: p2 in a2 and p1 in l1_2 at the same time. So when p1 is in l1_2, p2 must be in a2. So a2 would be in some location, perhaps flying between cities.

Putting this together:

Possible plan steps for p2:

1. Load p2 into a1 at l1_1. (Satisfies constraint 5)
2. Fly a1 to l2_1 (c2's airport). Now p2 is in a1, which is now at l2_1.
3. Unload p2 from a1 into l2_1.
4. Load p2 into a2 (since a2 is at l2_1). Now p2 is in a2. (Satisfies part of constraint 1)
5. Fly a2 to l1_1 (c1's airport). Now a2 is at l1_1, p2 inside.
6. Unload p2 into l1_1.
7. Load p2 into truck t1 (t1 is at l1_2, so need to drive t1 to l1_1 first. Wait, t1 starts at l1_2. So drive t1 to l1_1, load p2, then drive back to l1_2. But this would get p2 to l1_2, but also need to hit l1_4 and other constraints.

Alternatively, after step 6, unload p2 into l1_1, then drive t1 to l1_1, load p2, drive to l1_4 (unload there for constraint 6), then drive to l1_2.

But let's see. Let's outline:

For p2:

- Load into a1 (l1_1) → p2 in a1 (satisfies constraint 5)
- Fly a1 to l2_1 → a1 at l2_1, p2 inside
- Unload p2 → p2 in l2_1
- Load into a2 → p2 in a2 (satisfies part of constraint 1)
- Fly a2 to l1_1 → a2 at l1_1, p2 inside
- Unload p2 → p2 in l1_1
- Now need to get p2 to l1_4. Use truck t1:

Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1 (possible, same city c1)
Load p2 into t1
Drive t1 to l1_4, unload p2 → satisfies constraint 6
Then drive t1 back to l1_2, load p2 again (but wait, p2 is now in l1_4. So need to drive t1 to l1_4, load p2, drive to l1_2, unload. That would get p2 to l1_2 (goal) and also satisfy constraint 3.

But also, during this, when is p2 in l2_3 (constraint 2)?

Hmm, maybe after unloading p2 in l2_1 (from a1), before loading into a2, perhaps transport p2 via truck t2 to l2_3.

Wait, after step 3: p2 is in l2_1 (c2's airport). So truck t2 is in l2_4. So drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1 (possible in c2). Then load p2 into t2, drive to l2_3, unload. That would satisfy constraint 2. Then drive t2 back to l2_1, load p2 again, and proceed to load into a2.

But that adds steps. Let's see:

After step 3 (p2 in l2_1):

- Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1 (c2)
- Load p2 into t2
- Drive t2 to l2_3, unload p2 (satisfies constraint 2)
- Then load p2 into t2 again, drive back to l2_1
- Unload p2 into l2_1
- Load into a2
- Fly a2 to l1_1
- Unload p2 into l1_1
- Then proceed to move p2 to l1_4 and then l1_2.

But this seems lengthy. But necessary to meet all constraints.

Now, for p1:

p1 starts in l2_3 (c2). Goal is l2_5 (c2). But also, in the first constraint, p1 must be in l1_2. So we need to transport p1 to l1_2 (c1), but then back to c2? Wait, no. Because the final goal for p1 is l2_5 (c2). So how can that happen? Because if p1 is moved to l1_2 (c1), then to get back to c2, we need to fly again. But that complicates the plan. Wait, the first constraint says that in some state, p1 must be in l1_2. But the final goal is l2_5. So perhaps p1 is first moved to l1_2 (to satisfy the constraint), then back to c2, then to l2_5.

But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the order of operations allows p1 to be moved to l1_2 temporarily. Let's outline:

For p1:

- Start at l2_3 (c2). Need to get to l2_5 (c2). But also must be in l1_2 (c1) at some point.

So steps:

1. Use truck t2 (in l2_4) to drive to l2_3, load p1, drive to l2_1 (airport)
2. Unload p1 at l2_1
3. Load p1 into airplane a2 (at l2_1)
4. Fly a2 to l1_1 (c1's airport)
5. Unload p1 at l1_1
6. Use truck t1 (at l1_2) to drive to l1_1, load p1, drive back to l1_2, unload. Now p1 is in l1_2. (This satisfies the first constraint when combined with p2 being in a2)
7. Then, to get p1 back to c2 and to l2_5, we need to:
   a. Load p1 into a1 (at l1_1) or a2 (if it's there). But a2 is in l2_1 after step 4. So maybe use a1.

Wait, after step 4, a2 is in l1_1 (after flying from l2_1 to l1_1). So to get p1 back to c2:

8. Load p1 into a2 (now at l1_1)
9. Fly a2 back to l2_1
10. Unload p1 at l2_1
11. Load into truck t2 (drive to l2_1, load, drive to l2_5, unload)

But this is a lot. Let's check constraints.

The first constraint requires p1 to be in l1_2 and p2 in a2 at the same time. Let's see when that can happen.

Suppose during the time p1 is in l1_2 (after step 6), p2 is in a2. When is p2 in a2?

In the steps outlined for p2, after step 4 (loading into a2) and before step 5 (flying to l1_1), a2 is at l2_1 with p2 inside. So during that time, if p1 is in l1_2, then the two are in different cities. So maybe not. Alternatively, if a2 is flying to l1_1 with p2 inside, but p2 is in a2 during transit. Wait, but the constraint requires that in some state, p2 is in a2 and p1 is in l1_2. So during the flight, the airplane's location is changing, but in terms of states, each action changes the state. So after loading p2 into a2 (step 4 for p2), the state is p2 in a2 (at l2_1). Then when a2 flies to l1_1, during the flight, the airplane is en route, but after the fly action, a2 is at l1_1, and p2 is still in a2. So if during that time (after flying to l1_1 but before unloading), p1 is in l1_2, then that would satisfy the constraint.

But in the p1 steps, after step 6 (unloading p1 into l1_2), p1 is in l1_2. So if a2 is at l1_1 with p2 inside (after flying from l2_1 to l1_1), then during that state, p1 is in l1_2 and p2 is in a2. That would satisfy constraint 1.

So the order would need to be:

- For p2: steps 1-4 (loaded into a2 in l2_1)
- For p1: steps 1-6 (p1 in l1_2)
- Then fly a2 (with p2) to l1_1 (step 5 for p2)
- At this point, a2 is at l1_1 with p2 inside, and p1 is in l1_2. So this state satisfies constraint 1 (p2 in a2 and p1 in l1_2).

But wait, after flying a2 to l1_1, a2 is at l1_1, and p2 is still inside a2. So the state after the fly action is that a2 is at l1_1, p2 in a2. Then, during that state, p1 is in l1_2. So that's the required state for constraint 1.

So that works.

Now, the constraint 4: if p2 is in l1_2, then prior state must have p1 in l2_1 or l1_5. So when p2 is unloaded into l1_2 (final goal), there must be an earlier state where p1 was in l2_1 or l1_5. Looking at the steps, when p1 is unloaded at l1_1 (step 5 for p1), then loaded into t1 (step 6), and driven to l1_2. So before p2 is in l1_2, p1 was in l1_5? No. Or p1 was in l2_1 (which it was during steps 2-4). Let's see:

In the p1 steps:

- Step 2: p1 is unloaded at l2_1 (after being driven there by t2). Then loaded into a2 (step 3), flown to l1_1 (step 4), unloaded (step 5). So during step 2, p1 is in l2_1. That could satisfy the condition for constraint 4. So before p2 is in l1_2, p1 was in l2_1. So that's acceptable.

Now, the remaining constraints:

- p2 must be in l2_3 (constraint 2). As per the p2 steps, after being unloaded from a1 into l2_1 (step 3), we can drive t2 to l2_1, load p2, drive to l2_3, unload. Then drive back to l2_1 and load into a2.

Let's adjust the p2 steps to include this:

p2 steps:

1. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 → wait, t1 is in l1_2. Oh, no. Wait, initial positions:

Wait, initial state says:

- Package t1 is in location l1_2. Wait, but in the problem description, the user wrote "Package t1 is in location l1_2". Wait, t1 is a truck, not a package. Oh, this must be a typo. Let me check the original problem again.

Original problem's initial state:

"The original state of the world is the following:
	"Location l1_1 is in city c1"
	... 
	"Package t1 is in location l1_2"
	"Package t2 is in location l2_4"
	"Package p1 is in location l2_3"
	"Package p2 is in location l1_1"
	"Package a1 is in location l1_1"
	"Package a2 is in location l2_1"

Wait, no! Trucks and airplanes are considered as objects that can carry packages, but the initial state lists them as packages. That must be a mistake. For example, "Package t1 is in location l1_2" – but t1 is a truck. So this is likely a typo. The correct initial positions are:

- Truck t1 is in location l1_2.

- Truck t2 is in location l2_4.

- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1.

- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1.

But the problem statement says "Package t1 is in location l1_2" etc., which is incorrect. Assuming that's a typo and should be "Truck t1 is in location l1_2", "Truck t2 is in location l2_4", "Airplane a1 is in location l1_1", "Airplane a2 is in location l2_1". Because otherwise, the problem is impossible, as you can't load packages into other packages.

Assuming that, then the initial state is:

Trucks:

- t1 in l1_2 (c1)

- t2 in l2_4 (c2)

Airplanes:

- a1 in l1_1 (c1)

- a2 in l2_1 (c2)

Packages:

- p1 in l2_3 (c2)

- p2 in l1_1 (c1)

So back to p2's movement.

So p2 is initially in l1_1 (c1). To load into a1, which is at l1_1.

So step for p2:

1. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 → now p2 is in a1.

2. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 → a1 is now at l2_1, p2 inside.

3. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 → p2 is in l2_1.

4. Now, need to get p2 to l2_3. Use truck t2 (which is in l2_4).

So drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1 (c2).

5. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.

6. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2.

7. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 → p2 is in l2_3 (constraint 2).

8. Then, drive t2 back to l2_1.

9. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 → no, after unloading, p2 is in l2_3. So step 7 is unloading, so p2 is in l2_3. Then to get p2 back to l2_1, need to load into t2 again.

Wait, step 7: unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3. So p2 is now in l2_3. So to move p2 back to l2_1, we need:

8. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 → possible if t2 is in l2_3.

But after step 6, t2 was driven to l2_3. So after step 6, t2 is in l2_3. Then step 7 unloads p2 there. So t2 is still in l2_3. So step 8: load p2 into t2 again (t2 is in l2_3).

9. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2.

10. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 → p2 back in l2_1.

11. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 → now p2 is in a2 (satisfies part of constraint 1).

12. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 → a2 arrives at l1_1, p2 inside.

13. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 → p2 in l1_1.

14. Now, need to get p2 to l1_4 and then to l1_2.

Use truck t1 (in l1_2):

15. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1.

16. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

17. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1.

18. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 → constraint 6 satisfied.

19. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1.

20. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 → goal achieved.

But during this, when does p2 get into a1? That was step 1. So constraint 5 is satisfied.

Now, for p1:

Initial location l2_3 (c2). Goal l2_5.

But also, must be in l1_2 at some point (constraint 1). So steps for p1:

1. Load into truck t2 (which is in l2_3 after step 8 above? No, t2 is moving p2. Let's check the timeline.

Wait, the steps for p2 involve t2 being used to move p2 from l2_1 to l2_3 (steps 4-7), then back to l2_1 (steps 8-10). Then p2 is loaded into a2 (step 11), flown to l1_1 (step 12). Meanwhile, p1 is still in l2_3. So to move p1:

p1 is at l2_3. Need to get to l2_5. But also, must be moved to l1_2 at some point.

So for p1:

1. Use truck t2 (which is in l2_4 initially). So first, drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_3.

2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3.

3. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2.

4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1.

5. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1.

6. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

7. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1.

8. Now, need to get p1 to l1_2. Use truck t1 (initially at l1_2).

So drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1.

9. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1.

10. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1.

11. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2. → constraint 1 (p1 in l1_2) is satisfied here.

Now, to get p1 back to c2 and to l2_5:

12. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2.

13. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1.

14. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1.

15. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1. (Assuming a1 is back in l1_1. Wait, a1 was flown to l2_1 in step 2 of p2's steps. So after step 2, a1 is in l2_1. Then p2 is unloaded, and a1 remains in l2_1 unless flown back.

But for p1 to be loaded into a1, a1 must be in l1_1. So perhaps after step 2 (fly a1 to l2_1), we need to fly a1 back to l1_1 before step 15. But that would require additional steps. Alternatively, use a different airplane. But only a1 and a2 are available. a2 is in l1_1 after step 6 of p1's steps. So maybe use a2.

Wait, after step 6 of p1's steps, a2 is flown to l1_1. So to get p1 back to c2, perhaps load into a2 again.

But let's adjust:

After step 11 (p1 in l1_2), to get back to c2:

12. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2.

13. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1.

14. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1.

15. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 → a2 is at l1_1 after step 6 of p1's steps.

16. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1.

17. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1.

18. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 → t2 is in l2_1 after step 10 of p2's steps.

19. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2.

20. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 → goal achieved.

This seems possible, but there's a lot of back-and-forth. Also, need to ensure that all constraints are met and the plan is optimal (shortest possible).

But considering all the constraints, this might be the minimal steps. However, perhaps there's a way to optimize.

Let's try to merge the steps for both packages, looking for overlaps and possible optimizations.

For example, when a2 is flying from l2_1 to l1_1 with p2 (step 12 in p2's steps), perhaps p1 can be on the same airplane. But since p1 is in l2_1 after being unloaded from t2 (step 4 of p1's steps), then loaded into a2 (step 5), which is flying to l1_1 (step 6). So p1 is in a2 when it's flown to l1_1. Then, after that flight, unload p1 and proceed.

But during this, a2 is carrying both p1 and p2? No, because when a2 is loaded with p2 in step 11 of p2's steps, then flown to l1_1 (step 12), then unloaded (step 13). Then p1 is loaded into a2 later. So they are separate.

Alternatively, maybe combine some steps.

But given the complexity, perhaps the initial outline is the way to go.

Now, let's check the constraints again:

1. p2 in a2 and p1 in l1_2 at the same state. This happens after step 12 of p2's steps (a2 is at l1_1 with p2 inside) and step 11 of p1's steps (p1 in l1_2). So after flyairplane a2 to l1_1 (p2 in a2) and p1 unloaded in l1_2, that's the state where both are true.

2. p2 in l2_3: achieved in step 7 of p2's steps.

3. p2 in l1_2: final step.

4. Before p2 is in l1_2, p1 was in l2_1 (step 4 of p1's steps).

5. p2 in a1: step 1 of p2's steps.

6. p2 in l1_4: step 18 of p2's steps.

So all constraints are met.

Now, let's count the steps and see if it's optimal.

But the plan seems quite long. Maybe there's a shorter way.

Alternative approach: Use a1 to carry p2 to l2_1, then truck to l2_3, truck back, then a2 to carry p2 to l1_1, then truck to l1_4 and l1_2.

For p1: Use a2 to carry to l1_1, then truck to l1_2, then a1 to carry back to c2, then truck to l2_5.

But perhaps combining some flights.

Alternatively, when a2 is flying p1 to l1_1, can it also carry p2 back? But p2 would have to be loaded into a2 in l2_1 after being moved there.

But this might save steps. Let's see.

But this is getting too tangled. Perhaps the initial plan is the only way to satisfy all constraints, and thus is optimal given the constraints.

Now, to write the plan in order, considering the dependencies between actions.

Let's sequence the actions step by step, interleaving p1 and p2's steps where possible.

Here's a possible sequence:

1. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 → p2 in a1 (constraint 5)
2. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 → a1 at l2_1, p2 inside
3. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 → p2 in l2_1
4. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2 → move t2 to l2_1
5. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 → p2 in t2
6. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2 → move to l2_3
7. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 → p2 in l2_3 (constraint 2)
8. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 → p2 back in t2
9. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2 → back to l2_1
10. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 → p2 in l2_1
11. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 → p2 in a2 (part of constraint 1)
12. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2 → move t2 to l2_3 for p1
13. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 → p1 in t2 (p1 starts here)
14. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2 → move p1 to l2_1
15. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 → p1 in l2_1 (satisfies part of constraint 4)
16. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 → p1 in a2 (a2 is at l2_1)
17. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 → a2 arrives at l1_1 with p1 and p2 (wait, no. Step 11 loaded p2 into a2. Then step 16 loads p1 into a2. So after step 16, a2 has both p1 and p2. Then fly to l1_1. Then unload both. But can an airplane carry multiple packages? The problem statement doesn't limit that. So this is possible.

But then, when a2 arrives at l1_1, both p1 and p2 are in a2. Then unload them.

But let's continue:

18. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 → p1 in l1_1
19. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 → p2 in l1_1 (now a2 is empty)
20. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 → move t1 to l1_1
21. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 → p1 in t1
22. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1 → move to l1_2
23. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 → p1 in l1_2 (constraint 1, along with p2 in a2 earlier?)

Wait, no. At this point, p2 is unloaded into l1_1 (step 19). So p2 is no longer in a2. So the state where p1 is in l1_2 and p2 is in a2 must occur before step 19. But when is that?

After step 17 (fly a2 to l1_1 with p2 and p1), the state is a2 at l1_1, with both packages inside. Then, after steps 18 and 19, they are unloaded. So before unloading, when a2 is at l1_1 with both p1 and p2 inside, but p1 is in a2, not in l1_2 yet. So the state where p1 is in l1_2 is after step 23. But in that state, p2 is already unloaded into l1_1. So the constraint 1 (p2 in a2 and p1 in l1_2) is not met. So this approach doesn't work.

Thus, the initial approach where p1 is moved to l1_2 while p2 is in a2 is better.

Going back to the earlier plan:

Sequence:

For p2:

1. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
2. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
3. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
4. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
5. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
6. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
7. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (constraint 2)
8. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
9. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
10. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
11. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (now p2 in a2)
12. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (a2 at l1_1, p2 inside)
13. Now, handle p1:

For p1:

14. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2 (t2 is at l2_1 after step 10)
15. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (p1 is at l2_3)
16. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
17. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
18. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (but a2 is at l1_1 now. So this won't work. Conflict here.)

Ah, this shows a mistake in the plan. After step 12, a2 is at l1_1, so can't be loaded in l2_1. So this approach is flawed.

Thus, the initial plan needs adjustment. Let's rethink.

Alternative approach to satisfy constraint 1:

- Have a2 carry p2 to l1_1, and while a2 is at l1_1 with p2 inside, p1 is in l1_2. But p1 can't be in l1_2 unless it's transported there via truck.

So steps:

For p2:

1. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
2. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
3. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
4. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (a2 is at l2_1)
5. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (now a2 is at l1_1 with p2)
6. Now, during this time, p1 needs to be in l1_2.

For p1:

7. Use truck t2 to move p1 from l2_3 to l2_1:

   a. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2
   b. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
   c. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
   d. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
   e. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (a2 is at l2_1 before step 5)
   f. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (now a2 is at l1_1 with p1 and p2)
   g. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
   h. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (now p2 is in l1_1)
   i. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
   j. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
   k. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
   l. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 → now p1 is in l1_2 (constraint 1)
   
At this point, a2 is at l1_1, but p2 is unloaded into l1_1. So to have p2 in a2 and p1 in l1_2 at the same time, we need to have p2 in a2 while p1 is in l1_2. But in the current steps, after step 5, a2 is at l1_1 with p2 inside. Then steps f and g unload p1 into a2 (but a2 is flying from l2_1 to l1_1). Wait, this is getting too confused.

Alternatively, after step 5, a2 is at l1_1 with p2 inside. Then, before unloading p2, move p1 to l1_2. But p1 is in c2. So this requires another flight for p1.

This is getting too complicated. Perhaps the optimal plan requires a certain number of steps, and due to the constraints, it's necessarily longer. Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed to outline the plan based on the initial approach, ensuring all constraints are met, even if it's long.

Final plan steps (order matters):

For p2:

1. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
2. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
3. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
4. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
5. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
6. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
7. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (constraint 2)
8. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
9. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
10. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
11. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (now p2 in a2)
12. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (a2 at l1_1, p2 inside)
13. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (p2 in l1_1)
14. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
15. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
16. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
17. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (constraint 6)
18. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1
19. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (goal)

For p1:

20. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2 (after step 10, t2 is in l2_1)
21. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (p1 starts here)
22. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
23. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
24. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (a2 is at l1_1 after step 12; conflict!)
 
Ah, here's the problem. After step 12, a2 is at l1_1, so can't load p1 into a2 in l2_1. This is a mistake.

Correct approach:

For p1 to be loaded into a2, a2 must be in l2_1. But after step 12, a2 is in l1_1. So steps for p1 must occur before step 12.

Adjust the sequence:

Interleave p1 and p2 steps.

1. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
2. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
3. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
4. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
5. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
6. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
7. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (constraint 2)
8. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
9. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
10. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
11. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (p2 in a2)
12. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2 (move t2 to l2_3 for p1)
13. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
14. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
15. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (p1 in l2_1)
16. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (a2 is at l2_1 with p2 inside? Can a2 carry both p1 and p2? Assuming yes.)
17. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (a2 arrives at l1_1 with p1 and p2)
18. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (p1 in l1_1)
19. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (p2 in l1_1)
20. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
21. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
22. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
23. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 (constraint 1: p1 in l1_2 and p2 in a2 was during flight, but after flight, p2 is unloaded. So need to adjust.)

Wait, during step 17, a2 is flying to l1_1 with both p1 and p2. After landing, p1 and p2 are in a2 until steps 18 and 19. So before unloading, when a2 is at l1_1, p1 and p2 are in a2. If during this state, p1 is still in a2 (not yet unloaded), then p1 is not in l1_2. So the only way to have p1 in l1_2 and p2 in a2 is to have p1 in l1_2 and a2 in some location with p2 inside. But after step 17, a2 is at l1_1, so to have p1 in l1_2, we need to unload p1 and move it there, which requires steps 18-23. But by that time, p2 is unloaded from a2 (step 19). So this approach doesn't satisfy constraint 1.

Thus, the only way to have both p1 in l1_2 and p2 in a2 is if a2 is in l1_1 (after flying from l2_1) with p2 inside, and p1 is in l1_2. But p1 can only get to l1_2 via truck t1 after being flown to l1_1 and then moved. So during the time a2 is at l1_1 with p2 inside, p1 is being transported. So the state after step 17 (a2 at l1_1 with p1 and p2 inside) is the only time when p2 is in a2. But p1 is in a2, not in l1_2. So to satisfy constraint 1, we need to have p1 in l1_2 and p2 in a2 in the same state. This seems impossible with the current steps.

Alternative plan:

Maybe use a different airplane for p1. Like, after moving p2 to a2, fly a2 to l1_1. Then, unload p2 into l1_1, then load p1 into a different airplane (a1, which is in l2_1 after step 2). But a1 is in l2_1 after step 2. So to fly p1 from l2_1 to l1_1, we need to load p1 into a1 and fly back.

But this adds steps.

Alternatively:

For p1:

1. After step 15 (p1 in l2_1):

16. loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 (a1 is in l2_1 after step 2)
17. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
18. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
19. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
20. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
21. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
22. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 (now p1 in l1_2)

Meanwhile, for p2:

After step 11 (p2 in a2 at l2_1):

12. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (a2 arrives at l1_1 with p2)
13. At this point, a2 is at l1_1 with p2 inside. So during this state (after step 12), p1 is in l1_2 (step 22). So this satisfies constraint 1: p2 in a2 and p1 in l1_2.

Then, continue with p2:

14. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (p2 in l1_1)
15. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 (if not already there)
16. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
17. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
18. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (constraint 6)
19. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1
20. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (goal)

For p1, after step 22, to get back to c2:

23. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
24. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
25. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
26. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (a2 is at l1_1 after step 12)
27. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
28. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
29. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (t2 is at l2_1 after step 9)
30. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
31. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (goal)

This way, constraint 1 is satisfied after step 12 (fly a2 to l1_1 with p2) and step 22 (p1 in l1_2). The state after step 12 and before step 14 (unloading p2) has p2 in a2 and p1 in l1_2.

Now, checking all constraints:

1. p2 in a2 and p1 in l1_2 after step 12 and step 22. This is valid.
2. p2 in l2_3 after step 7.
3. p2 in l1_2 after step 20.
4. Before p2 is in l1_2 (step 20), p1 was in l2_1 (step 15) which satisfies the antecedent.
5. p2 in a1 after step 1.
6. p2 in l1_4 after step 18.

All constraints are met.

Now, counting the steps. But since the problem requires an optimal plan (shortest possible), we need to see if any steps can be merged or eliminated.

For example, steps 15-20 for p2 involve moving p2 from l1_1 to l1_4 then to l1_2. Maybe can combine these by driving t1 from l1_2 to l1_1, load p2, drive to l1_4, unload (constraint 6), then drive to l1_2 and unload. But that's what's already done.

Another optimization: When flying a2 to l1_1 with p2 (step 12), and then using a2 to carry p1 back to c2 (step 27), that's efficient.

Overall, this plan seems to be the minimal steps required to satisfy all constraints and goals. Thus, this is the optimal plan.
