Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. So, the goal is to get p1 to l2_5 and p2 to l2_1, right? And there are a bunch of constraints we have to satisfy along the way. Let me start by understanding the initial state and the constraints.

First, the initial state:

- Locations:
  - c1 has l1_1 (airport), l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5.
  - c2 has l2_1 (airport), l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5.
  
- Packages:
  - p1 is at l2_3 (in c2)
  - p2 is at l2_4 (in c2)
  
- Trucks:
  - t1 is at l1_2 (in c1)
  - t2 is at l2_3 (in c2)
  
- Airplanes:
  - a1 is at l1_1 (c1's airport)
  - a2 is at l2_1 (c2's airport)

Wait, the original state says "Package t1 is in location l1_2" but t1 is a truck, not a package. That must be a typo. Similarly for t2. Probably, they meant "Truck t1 is in location l1_2" and "Truck t2 is in location l2_3". Because otherwise, if t1 and t2 are packages, then where are the trucks? The problem mentions trucks t1 and t2. So I think that's a mistake in the original state description. Let me proceed under that assumption.

So, t1 is in c1's l1_2, t2 in c2's l2_3. a1 is at l1_1 (c1's airport), a2 at l2_1 (c2's airport).

Goal: p1 at l2_5 (c2) and p2 at l2_1 (c2's airport).

Constraints:

1. At some state, both p2 in t1 and p1 in l1_1.
2. At some state, p2 is in l2_1 (which is the goal for p2, so that's covered).
3. If p2 is in l2_1 in some state, then earlier there must be p2 in l1_2 or p1 in l2_2.
4. At some state, p2 is in a1 or p2 is in l1_5.
5. At some state, p2 is in l2_4 (its initial location, so maybe that's already true, but need to check if it's required to be there again after moving).
6. If p2 is in l2_4 in some state s, then p1 must be in l2_4 at s or after.
7. At some state, p1 is in t1.

So, the constraints complicate things. Let's break them down.

First, the main plan: how to get p1 to l2_5 and p2 to l2_1.

p1 is initially at l2_3 (c2). To get to l2_5, which is in the same city. Since trucks can move within the city, maybe use t2 (which is at l2_3) to move p1. So load p1 into t2 at l2_3, drive t2 to l2_5, unload p1 there.

For p2, which is at l2_4. Need to get to l2_1. l2_1 is an airport. So maybe use a2 (which is already at l2_1?), wait, a2 is at l2_1. Wait, but if we need to load p2 into a2, the airplane has to be at the same location as the package. So p2 is at l2_4. To get to l2_1, perhaps use a truck to move it to l2_1. Because l2_1 is an airport in c2. So, use t2 (if available) or another truck. Wait, t2 is at l2_3. So, perhaps drive t2 to l2_4, load p2 into t2, drive to l2_1 (since l2_1 is in c2, so the truck can drive there?), wait but are the locations connected? The drivetruck action allows moving between any two locations in the same city. So yes, t2 can drive from l2_3 to l2_4, then to l2_1. Then unload p2 there. That would work.

But wait, l2_1 is an airport. So if we can drive the truck there, then unload p2, that's fine.

But let's check the constraints.

Constraint 7: p1 must be in t1 at some state. But t1 is in c1. So how can p1, which starts in c2, get into t1? That requires moving p1 from c2 to c1, load into t1, then move back. That's a problem. Because to move between cities, we need airplanes. So perhaps:

p1's path: l2_3 (c2) -> loaded into t2, driven to l2_1 (airport), unloaded, loaded into a2, flown to l1_1 (c1's airport), unloaded, loaded into t1 (which is in l1_2, so first drive t1 to l1_1?), load p1 into t1, then perhaps drive t1 to l1_1's airport, then fly back to c2? Wait, but the goal is to have p1 in l2_5 (c2). So maybe after loading p1 into t1, drive t1 to l1_1, then load into a1, fly to l2_1 (c2's airport), unload into a2, then load into t2, drive to l2_5. But this seems complicated. But the constraint requires p1 to be in t1 at some point. So we have to include that.

But how to get p1 into t1 which is in c1. So p1 is in c2. So steps:

1. Move p1 from l2_3 to l2_1 (using t2).
   - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
   - drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
   - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

2. Then load p1 into a2 at l2_1.
   - loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
   - flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (c1's airport)
   - unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (wait, but a2 is flying to l1_1. So when a2 arrives at l1_1, unload p1 there.

Wait, no. If we fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1, then a2 is now at l1_1. Then unload p1 from a2 at l1_1. Then p1 is at l1_1. Then load p1 into t1. But t1 is in l1_2. So drive t1 to l1_1.

So steps:

3. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
4. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (now p1 is in t1, satisfying constraint 7)
5. Then drive t1 back to l1_2? Not sure. But then we need to get p1 to l2_5. So after loading into t1, perhaps unload p1 at l1_1, then load into a1 (which is already at l1_1), fly to l2_1, unload, then load into t2, drive to l2_5.

But this is getting complex, but let's see.

But also, need to handle p2's movement to l2_1, but with constraints.

Constraint 3: When p2 is in l2_1 (the goal), there must have been a previous state where p2 was in l1_2 or p1 in l2_2. But p1 is initially in l2_3. So perhaps p1 needs to go to l2_2 at some point, which is in c2. But how?

Alternatively, p2 needs to be in l1_2. But p2 starts in l2_4 (c2). To get to l1_2 (c1), need to move it via airplane. So load p2 into a2 at l2_1 (after moving it there), fly to l1_1, then load into t1, drive to l1_2. Then unload p2 there. That would satisfy the first part of constraint 1: p2 in t1 and p1 in l1_1. Wait, but constraint 1 requires both p2 in t1 and p1 in l1_1 at the same time. So that's tricky. Let's see.

Constraint 1: At some state, p2 is in t1 and p1 is in l1_1. So, to have p2 in t1 (which is in c1's l1_2), we need to move p2 to c1. Let's see.

So p2 starts in l2_4 (c2). Maybe we first move p2 to l2_1 via truck, then load into a2, fly to l1_1, unload into a1, then load into t1 (which needs to be driven to l1_1). Then p2 is in t1, and p1 could be in l1_1 (if we unload p1 there from a2 or a1). Hmm.

But let's outline a possible plan.

First, handle p2's movement to l2_1:

But wait, the goal is p2 in l2_1, so that's the end. But the constraints require that when p2 is in l2_1, there must have been a prior state where p2 was in l1_2 or p1 in l2_2. So we need to ensure that either p2 was in l1_2 before reaching l2_1, or p1 was in l2_2.

Alternatively, maybe during the plan, p1 is moved to l2_2, which would satisfy that condition. Let's consider that.

So, perhaps:

For p1:

- Move from l2_3 to l2_2 using t2 (drive t2 to l2_3, load p1, drive to l2_2, unload). Then, this satisfies that in some state, p1 is in l2_2, which would meet the condition for constraint 3. Then proceed to move p1 to l2_5.

But then, how to get p1 to l2_5? Maybe after that, load into t2 again and drive to l2_5.

But let's step back.

Let me try to outline the steps considering all constraints.

Constraints:

1. At least one state where p2 is in t1 and p1 is in l1_1.

2. At least one state where p2 is in l2_1 (the goal, so this is covered).

3. If p2 is in l2_1 in some state, then prior state with p2 in l1_2 or p1 in l2_2.

4. At least one state where p2 is in a1 or l1_5.

5. At least one state where p2 is in l2_4 (initial location, but maybe after moving away and back? Or maybe the initial state counts. But the problem says "in at least one state", which includes the initial state. So maybe p2 starts in l2_4, so constraint 5 is satisfied. But the problem might require that it's in l2_4 at some point after the initial state. Not sure. Let's check: The constraint says "must hold in at least one state". The initial state has p2 in l2_4, so that's covered. So constraint 5 is already satisfied. But perhaps during the plan, p2 is moved elsewhere and then back. But maybe not necessary. So that's already satisfied.

6. If p2 is in l2_4 in some state s, then p1 must be in l2_4 at s or after. Since p2 starts in l2_4, in the initial state, p1 is in l2_3, so this condition is not met. Therefore, we need to ensure that whenever p2 is in l2_4 (after the initial state), p1 must be there at that state or later. But p2 is in l2_4 initially. So unless the initial state counts, but the problem says "if the expression holds in some state s", so the initial state is a state. Therefore, in the initial state, p2 is in l2_4, but p1 is not. So this violates constraint 6. Therefore, the initial state does not satisfy the implication. Wait, no. The constraint says: If p2 is in l2_4 in s, then p1 must be in l2_4 at s or after. In the initial state, p2 is in l2_4, but p1 is not. So the constraint is violated. Therefore, the initial state is not acceptable. Therefore, the plan must ensure that whenever p2 is in l2_4 (after the initial state), p1 is there at that state or after. But how can that be? Because the initial state is part of the plan. So the only way to satisfy this constraint is that either p2 is never in l2_4 except in the initial state (but then the constraint applies to the initial state, which would fail), or that in the initial state, the implication is satisfied. But in the initial state, the antecedent (p2 in l2_4) is true, but the consequent (p1 in l2_4 now or later) is false. Therefore, the plan is invalid unless we ensure that after the initial state, whenever p2 is in l2_4, p1 is there then or later. So perhaps we have to move p1 to l2_4 before moving p2 out of l2_4. Let's think.

So, the initial state has p2 in l2_4. To satisfy constraint 6, we need that whenever p2 is in l2_4 (in any state, including the initial state), p1 must be in l2_4 at that state or later. However, in the initial state, p1 is in l2_3. Therefore, the initial state violates this constraint. But the problem says the constraints are part of the planning problem, so the initial state may not satisfy all constraints, but the plan must ensure that all constraints are met during execution. Wait, no. The constraints are part of the problem that the plan must satisfy. So, for example, the plan must include a state where certain conditions hold. However, the initial state is part of the plan's execution. So for constraint 6, if in any state s (including initial) p2 is in l2_4, then p1 must be in l2_4 at s or after. But in the initial state, s0, p2 is in l2_4, but p1 is not. Therefore, the plan must ensure that after s0, p1 is moved to l2_4 at some point. Because the implication is: if in s, p2 is in l2_4, then there exists a state s' >= s where p1 is in l2_4. But in the initial state s0, p2 is in l2_4, so the plan must have p1 in l2_4 at s0 or later. Since in s0, p1 is in l2_3, we need to have p1 in l2_4 at some point after s0.

So, the plan must include moving p1 to l2_4. Then, after that, whenever p2 is in l2_4, p1 is there or comes later.

But p2 starts in l2_4. So the first step is to move p1 to l2_4 before moving p2. Because if we move p2 first, then p2 may be elsewhere, but if we don't, then the initial state violates constraint 6. Wait, but the problem states that the constraints must hold in the plan's execution. So the initial state is part of the execution. Therefore, to satisfy constraint 6, we must ensure that in the initial state, either p2 is not in l2_4 (which it is), or p1 is in l2_4 (which it's not). But since the initial state is given, the constraint is violated unless the plan somehow makes p1 reach l2_4 before or when p2 is in l2_4 again. Wait, no. The constraint is: If in any state s, p2 is in l2_4, then in s or a subsequent state, p1 is in l2_4. The initial state is s0. So in s0, p2 is in l2_4, but p1 is not. Therefore, the plan must ensure that after s0, p1 is moved to l2_4 at some point. Because the constraint requires that for s0, there exists a state s' >= s0 where p1 is in l2_4. So even if p2 is moved out of l2_4 immediately, the plan must have p1 in l2_4 at some point after s0.

Therefore, we need to move p1 to l2_4 at some point. So, let's add that step.

p1 starts at l2_3. So, using t2 (which is at l2_3), load p1 into t2, drive to l2_4, unload. Then p1 is in l2_4. This would satisfy the constraint 6 because after the initial state, p1 is moved to l2_4. So any state where p2 is in l2_4 after that would have p1 there or later.

But then, after moving p1 to l2_4, we can move p2 from l2_4. But since p2 needs to end up in l2_1, perhaps we can load p2 into t2 at l2_4, drive to l2_1, and unload.

But let's see the steps:

1. Load p1 into t2 at l2_3.
   - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

2. Drive t2 to l2_4.
   - drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2

3. Unload p1 in l2_4.
   - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

Now, p1 is in l2_4. This satisfies constraint 6 because after the initial state, whenever p2 is in l2_4 (if it returns), p1 is there. But in this case, after step 3, p1 is in l2_4. Then, if we move p2 out of l2_4, say load it into t2:

4. Load p2 into t2 at l2_4.
   - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

5. Drive t2 to l2_1.
   - drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2

6. Unload p2 at l2_1.
   - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

But this would achieve p2's goal. However, we also need to get p1 to l2_5. So after step 3, p1 is in l2_4. How to get it to l2_5.

7. Load p1 into t2 again (since t2 is now in l2_1 after step 5? Wait, no. After step 5, t2 is driven to l2_1. So after step 5, t2 is at l2_1. So after step 3, p1 is at l2_4. To move p1 from l2_4 to l2_5, we need another truck or move t2 back. But t2 is in l2_1 after step 5. So perhaps use another truck. Wait, the trucks available are t1 (in c1) and t2 (in c2). So in c2, only t2 is present. So perhaps after moving p2 to l2_1, we need to drive t2 back to l2_4 to pick up p1. But that's time-consuming. Alternatively, use a different approach.

Alternatively, after step 3, p1 is in l2_4. Then, load p1 into t2 (which is at l2_4 after step 2 and 3), drive t2 to l2_5, unload. But steps 4-6 would require t2 to be at l2_4 to load p2. So perhaps:

After step 3, t2 is at l2_4 (since step 2 was driving to l2_4). So:

4. Load p1 into t2 again at l2_4.
   - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

5. Drive t2 to l2_5.
   - drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2

6. Unload p1 at l2_5.
   - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

Then p1 is at goal. Then, drive t2 back to l2_4 to get p2.

7. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2

8. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

9. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2

10. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

But this would work for p1 and p2. But let's check constraints.

Constraint 7: p1 must be in t1 at some state. In this plan, p1 is never in t1. So this is a problem. So this approach doesn't satisfy all constraints.

So we need to find a way to get p1 into t1, which is in c1. So p1 has to go to c1, be loaded into t1, then back to c2. But how?

Alternative approach:

Use airplanes to move p1 between cities.

First, move p1 to l2_1 (c2's airport) via truck t2.

Then load into airplane a2, fly to l1_1 (c1's airport).

Unload p1, load into truck t1 (which is at l1_2, so drive t1 to l1_1 first).

Then, drive t1 back to l1_2, unload p1 there. Then, load into airplane a1, fly to l2_1, unload, load into truck t2, drive to l2_5.

This way, p1 is in t1 at some point (satisfying constraint 7), and also meets the other constraints.

Let's outline this:

For p1:

1. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
2. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
3. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
4. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
5. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
6. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
7. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
8. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (now constraint 7 is satisfied: p1 is in t1)
9. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
10. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
11. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_2 (wait, a1 is at l1_1, not l1_2. So need to move a1 to l1_2? No, airplanes can only move between airports. So l1_1 is an airport, l1_2 is not. So a1 is at l1_1. So to load p1 into a1, it needs to be at l1_1. But after step 10, p1 is at l1_2. So need to use truck t1 to move it back to l1_1.

Wait, after step 10, p1 is unloaded at l1_2. So steps 7-10:

7. Drive t1 to l1_1, load p1, drive back to l1_2, unload. That leaves p1 at l1_2. To get it into a1, which is at l1_1, need to drive t1 again to l1_1.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let's try to adjust.

After step 6: p1 is at l1_1 (from unloading from a2). Then:

7. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
8. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (now p1 is in t1)
9. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1 (unnecessary unless needed)
10. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 (but why? Maybe not needed. Instead, after step 8, we can load p1 into a1 at l1_1.

Wait, after step 8, p1 is in t1 at l1_1. So to load into a1, which is also at l1_1:

9. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
10. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
11. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
12. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
13. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (assuming t2 is there)
14. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
15. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

But steps for p2:

p2 is at l2_4. Need to get to l2_1. Also, need to satisfy constraint 3: when p2 is in l2_1, there must have been a prior state where p2 was in l1_2 or p1 was in l2_2.

Assuming we take the path where p2 is moved to l1_2 at some point, which would also help with constraint 1 (p2 in t1 and p1 in l1_1).

So for p2:

First, move p2 to l2_1 via truck t2. But we also need to satisfy constraint 4: p2 in a1 or l1_5. So perhaps move p2 to a1 at some point.

Let me try integrating p2's movements.

But let's first outline p2's required steps.

p2 starts at l2_4. To get to l2_1, we can use truck t2. But we need to handle constraints.

Constraint 3: when p2 is in l2_1 (goal), there must be a prior state where p2 was in l1_2 or p1 in l2_2.

Suppose we choose to have p2 in l1_2 at some point.

So, steps for p2:

1. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
2. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
3. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (but this would reach the goal, but constraint 3 requires a prior state with p2 in l1_2 or p1 in l2_2. So this path doesn't satisfy it. Therefore, we need to take a different route.

Alternative plan for p2:

Take p2 to c1, then back to c2.

For example:

1. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
2. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
3. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
4. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
5. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
6. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
7. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (need to drive t1 to l1_1 first)
   - drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 (already done as part of p1's steps)
8. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
9. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (now p2 is in l1_2, which satisfies the first part of constraint 3 if we later move p2 back to l2_1)
10. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
11. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
12. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
13. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (a1 is here)
14. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
15. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (now p2 is at goal)

But this seems very long. Also, during this process, when we unload p2 at l1_2 (step 9), that's a state where p2 is in l1_2, which can satisfy constraint 3 when later p2 is in l2_1. Also, when p2 is loaded into t1 (steps 7 and 10), that would satisfy constraint 1 (p2 in t1 and p1 in l1_1) if at that time p1 is in l1_1.

Looking back at p1's steps, after step 6, p1 is unloaded from a2 into l1_1. Then, step 7 is drivetruck t1 to l1_1. Then step 8: load p1 into t1. So during steps 7-8, p1 is in l1_1 (after being unloaded from a2) and then loaded into t1. So if during the same time, p2 is loaded into t1, we can have both p1 and p2 in t1. Wait, but maybe not. Let's see:

Let me try to interleave p1 and p2's steps.

Combined plan:

For p1:

1. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
2. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
3. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
4. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
5. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
6. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (now p1 is in l1_1)
7. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
8. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (now p1 is in t1, satisfying constraint 7)

For p2:

9. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (t2 is at l2_1 after step 2? No, after step 2, t2 is at l2_1. Wait, step 2 is driving t2 from l2_3 to l2_1. So after step 2, t2 is at l2_1. Then step 3 unloads p1 there. Then for p2, t2 is at l2_1. But p2 is at l2_4. So how to load p2 into t2? Need to drive t2 back to l2_4.

10. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
11. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
12. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
13. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
14. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
15. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
16. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (now p2 is in l1_1)
17. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (t1 is at l1_1 after step 7)
18. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
19. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (now p2 is in l1_2, satisfying part of constraint 3)
20. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
21. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
22. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
23. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
24. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
25. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (goal achieved)

For p1, after step 8, p1 is in t1 at l1_1. Then:

26. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
27. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
28. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_2 (but a1 is at l1_1. So need to fly a1 to l1_2? No, airports are only l1_1. So a1 can't fly to l1_2. Therefore, this approach won't work. So p1 is stuck in l1_2 unless we move it back to l1_1.

Alternatively, after step 8, p1 is in t1 at l1_1. Then:

26. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
27. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
28. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
29. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
30. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
31. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
32. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (goal achieved)

Now, check constraints:

Constraint 1: At least one state where p2 is in t1 and p1 is in l1_1.

Looking at the steps:

- After step 8, p1 is in t1 at l1_1. But p2 is being handled later. At step 17, p2 is loaded into t1 at l1_1. At that time, p1 is in t1 (if not unloaded yet). So if steps 8 (p1 loaded into t1) and step 17 (p2 loaded into t1) happen while both are in t1, then when is p1 in l1_1? 

Wait, step 8: p1 is loaded into t1 at l1_1. So p1 is in t1, which is in l1_1. Then step 17: load p2 into t1 (which is in l1_1). So at step 17, both p1 and p2 are in t1. But for constraint 1, we need p2 in t1 and p1 in l1_1. But p1 is in t1, which is in l1_1. So the location of p1 is l1_1 (since it's in t1 which is there). So during step 17, both p2 is in t1 and p1 is in t1 (which is in l1_1). So the condition "p2 is in t1 and p1 is in l1_1" is true. So this satisfies constraint 1.

Constraint 3: When p2 is in l2_1 (goal), there must have been a prior state where p2 was in l1_2 or p1 in l2_2.

In the plan, p2 is moved to l1_2 (step 19), so prior to reaching l2_1 (step 25), this condition is satisfied.

Constraint 4: p2 in a1 or l1_5. In step 23, p2 is loaded into a1. So when a1 is at l1_1, p2 is in a1. Then when a1 flies to l2_1, p2 is in a1 until unloaded. So this satisfies constraint 4 (p2 in a1).

Constraint 5: p2 in l2_4 at some state. Initial state satisfies this.

Constraint 6: If p2 is in l2_4, then p1 is there then or after. In the initial state, p2 is in l2_4 and p1 is not. But according to the plan, after the initial state, p1 is moved to l2_4 (steps 1-3: p1 is moved to l2_4). Wait, no. In the initial plan outline for p1, steps 1-3 are:

1. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
2. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
3. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

Wait, that moves p1 to l2_1, not l2_4. So p1 is never moved to l2_4, which violates constraint 6. Because in the initial state, p2 is in l2_4, and p1 is not. So the plan must include p1 in l2_4 after the initial state.

So we need to adjust the plan to move p1 to l2_4 before or after moving p2.

Wait, this is getting very complex. Let me try to adjust the plan to include moving p1 to l2_4.

Revised steps for p1:

1. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
2. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2 (instead of l2_1)
3. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (now p1 is in l2_4, satisfying constraint 6)
4. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
5. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
6. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
7. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
8. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
9. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
10. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
11. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (constraint 7 met)
12. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
13. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
14. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_2 (but a1 is at l1_1; this won't work. So need to adjust.)

Alternatively, after step 9, p1 is in l1_1. Then:

10. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
11. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (constraint 7)
12. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
13. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
14. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
15. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
16. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
17. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
18. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

For p2:

After step 3, p1 is in l2_4. Now handle p2:

19. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (t2 is at l2_1 after step 5. No, steps for p1 up to 5: after step 5, t2 is at l2_1. So to load p2 into t2, need to drive t2 back to l2_4.

This is getting too complicated. Perhaps a better approach is needed.

Alternative plan:

1. Move p1 to l2_4 first to satisfy constraint 6.

- loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
- drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
- unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

Now p1 is in l2_4. This satisfies constraint 6 because whenever p2 is in l2_4 after this, p1 is there or later. But p2 starts in l2_4. So after this step, whenever p2 is in l2_4 (if it returns), p1 is there. But p2 is moved out of l2_4 next.

2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
3. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (now p2 is in l2_1, but need to satisfy constraint 3: prior state with p2 in l1_2 or p1 in l2_2. Neither has happened yet. So this is a problem. Therefore, we need to adjust.

So p2 can't be moved directly to l2_1. Instead, need to take a detour.

Let's try moving p2 to l1_2 first.

5. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (but p2 is in l2_1 after step 4. So need to move p2 to l2_1 first via truck, then fly to c1.

Wait, after step 4, p2 is in l2_1. Then:

5. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
6. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
7. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
8. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (drive t1 to l1_1)
9. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
10. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (now p2 is in l1_2, satisfying constraint 3)
11. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
12. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
13. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
14. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
15. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
16. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (goal achieved)

Now, when p2 is unloaded at step 16, the prior state at step 10 has p2 in l1_2, satisfying constraint 3.

Meanwhile, for p1:

After step 1-3, p1 is in l2_4. Now, move p1 to l2_5.

17. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (t2 is at l2_1 after step 4. So need to drive t2 back to l2_4.

But after step 4, t2 is at l2_1. So:

17. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
18. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
19. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2
20. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (goal achieved)

But during this, when is constraint 7 (p1 in t1) satisfied? It hasn't been. So need to integrate that.

So p1 needs to be in t1. So perhaps:

After step 3, p1 is in l2_4. We need to move p1 to c1 and load into t1.

21. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
22. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
23. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
24. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
25. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
26. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
27. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
28. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (constraint 7 met)
29. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
30. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
31. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
32. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
33. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
34. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
35. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

But this makes the plan very long. Also, need to check constraints.

Constraint 1: p2 in t1 and p1 in l1_1. This happens when p2 is loaded into t1 (step 8) and p1 is in l1_1 (step 26-28). So during step 8, p2 is in t1 (at l1_1), and p1 is in l2_4 (from step 3). So not overlapping. Maybe when p1 is unloaded at l1_1 (step 26), and p2 is in t1 (step 8), that would be a state where p1 is in l1_1 and p2 is in t1.

Wait, step 26: p1 is unloaded into l1_1. Step 8: p2 is loaded into t1 at l1_1. So if these steps happen in the order:

7. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
8. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (t1 is at l1_1 after step 27)
9. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
...

Then during step 8, p2 is in t1, and p1 is in l1_1 (unloaded at step 26). So yes, this satisfies constraint 1.

Constraint 4: p2 in a1 or l1_5. When p2 is loaded into a1 (step 14), this satisfies it.

Constraint 7: p1 in t1 (step 28).

So this plan seems to satisfy all constraints. Now, let's check all steps:

Final plan steps:

For p1:

1. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
2. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
3. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
21. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
22. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
23. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
24. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
25. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
26. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
27. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
28. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
29. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
30. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
31. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
32. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
33. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
34. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
35. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

For p2:

4. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
5. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
6. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
7. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
8. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
9. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
10. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
11. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
12. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
13. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
14. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
15. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
16. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
17. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
18. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

Now, combining all steps in order:

1. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
2. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
3. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
4. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
5. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
6. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
7. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
8. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
9. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
10. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
11. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
12. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
13. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
14. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
15. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
16. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
17. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
18. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
19. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
20. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
21. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
22. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
23. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
24. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
25. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
26. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
27. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
28. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
29. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
30. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
31. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
32. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
33. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

Wait, this is very lengthy. But I need to ensure that all steps are in the correct order, considering dependencies.

Also, some steps can be optimized. For example, after step 5, t2 is at l2_1. Then step 4 is loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4, which requires t2 to be at l2_4. So the order here is incorrect. This indicates a mistake in the step numbering.

This shows that creating a correct and optimal plan manually is very error-prone. Given the complexity, perhaps the optimal plan involves fewer steps by cleverly interleaving the movements.

Alternative approach focusing on constraint satisfaction:

- To get p1 into t1 (constraint 7), we need to fly p1 to c1, load into t1.

- To satisfy constraint 1 (p2 in t1 and p1 in l1_1), we can have both p1 and p2 loaded into t1 at l1_1.

- To satisfy constraint 3, when p2 is in l2_1, there must be a prior state with p2 in l1_2 or p1 in l2_2. Moving p2 to l1_2 via t1.

- Constraint 4 requires p2 to be in a1 or l1_5. Loading p2 into a1 during its transport.

Here's a possible optimized plan:

1. Move p1 to l2_1 using t2.
2. Fly p1 to c1's airport l1_1.
3. Load p1 into t1 (now in t1, satisfying constraint 7).
4. Move p2 to l2_1 using t2.
5. Fly p2 to c1's airport l1_1.
6. Load both p1 and p2 into t1 (satisfies constraint 1).
7. Drive t1 to l1_2, unload p2 there (satisfies constraint 3's p2 in l1_2).
8. Fly p2 back to c2's airport l2_1 using airplane.
9. Move p1 back to c2 and to l2_5.
10. Ensure p2 is moved to l2_1.

Detailed steps:

1. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
2. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
3. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
4. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
5. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
6. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
7. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
8. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (constraint 7 met)
9. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
10. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
11. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
12. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
13. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
14. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
15. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (now p1 and p2 are in t1, in l1_1. Satisfies constraint 1)
16. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
17. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (p2 in l1_2, satisfying constraint 3)
18. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_2 (but a1 is at l1_1. Need to drive t1 back to l1_1)
19. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
20. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
21. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
22. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
23. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
24. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
25. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
26. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
27. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (again, but this might not be needed. Alternatively, after step 17, p2 is in l1_2. Then load into a1.)

This is still complex. Given time constraints, I'll attempt to write the optimal plan with the minimal steps, ensuring all constraints are met.
