Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. Hmm, the goal is to get p1 to l2_6 and p2 to l1_2. But there are a bunch of constraints to satisfy. Let me break this down step by step.

First, let's look at the initial state. The packages are: p1 is in l2_8 (city c2), p2 is in l2_2 (also c2). Trucks t1 is in l1_7 (c1), t2 in l2_4 (c2). Airplanes a1 in l1_1 (c1's airport), a2 in l2_1 (c2's airport).

So p1 needs to go from l2_8 to l2_6. That's within c2, so maybe use truck t2. But wait, t2 is in l2_4. So first, drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_8, load p1 into t2, then drive to l2_6 and unload. But wait, no, p1 is in l2_8, which is in c2. So maybe t2 can drive there. But t2 starts at l2_4. So drive t2 to l2_8, load p1, then drive to l2_6 and unload. That seems straightforward for p1.

But wait, there's a constraint for p1: "Package p1 is in t1" must hold at some state. But t1 is in c1, and p1 starts in c2. How can p1 get into t1? That would require moving p1 from c2 to c1. Which would need an airplane. Because trucks can't move between cities. So maybe p1 needs to be loaded onto an airplane, flown to c1, then put into t1. But why? Because one of the constraints is that p1 must be in t1 at some point.

Wait, the constraints are:

- "Package p1 is in t1" must hold in at least one state.

So even if p1's final destination is l2_6, it has to be in t1 at some point. But t1 is in c1. So that suggests that p1 has to be moved to c1, loaded into t1, then maybe moved back to c2? That complicates things. Let's see.

Similarly, for p2: needs to end up in l1_2 (c1). But p2 starts in l2_2 (c2). So p2 needs to be transported from c2 to c1. Again, using airplanes. Let's also check the constraints for p2.

Constraints for p2:

1. At least once, p2 is in l2_1. And if that's the case, then in that state or after, p2 must be in a1 or t2. But wait, the constraint says: If p2 is in l2_1 in state s, then in s or after, p2 is in a1 or t2. Wait, but l2_1 is an airport in c2, right? And a2 is at l2_1 initially. So if p2 is loaded into a2 at l2_1, then that's possible. But why would p2 be in l2_1? Because to load into an airplane, perhaps. Wait, p2 starts in l2_2. To get to l2_1, maybe via truck. So use truck t2 to drive from l2_4 to l2_2, load p2 into t2, drive to l2_1, unload, then load into a2. Then fly a2 to c1's airport l1_1, unload into a1? Wait, no. Wait, the airplanes can fly between airports. So a2 can fly from l2_1 (c2) to l1_1 (c1). Then, once p2 is in l1_1 (c1's airport), use truck t1 (which is in l1_7) to drive to l1_1, load p2, drive to l1_2, unload.

But there's a constraint that "Package p2 is in a2" must hold at some state. So p2 must be loaded into a2. Also, if p2 is in a2, then eventually it must be in l2_6. Wait, but the final goal is p2 in l1_2. So how does that work? Let's check the constraint again: If p2 is in a2 in state s, then in s or after, p2 must be in l2_6. But the final goal is p2 in l1_2, which is in c1. So if p2 is in a2, then after that, it must go to l2_6. But how can that happen if we need to take p2 to c1? This seems conflicting. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the constraints.

Let me re-examine the constraints:

Constraints:

1. p2 must be in l2_1 at least once. If p2 is in l2_1 in state s, then in s or after, p2 must be in a1 or t2.

But a1 is in c1's airport l1_1. So if p2 is in l2_1 (c2), how can it be in a1 (which is in c1)? That would require a1 to be in l2_1, but initially a1 is in l1_1. Unless a1 flies to l2_1. But that's possible. Wait, airplanes can fly between any airports. So maybe a1 can fly to l2_1, load p2, then fly back. But that's a lot of steps.

Alternatively, if p2 is loaded into a2 (which is in l2_1) when p2 is in l2_1. Because a2 starts in l2_1.

So to satisfy the first constraint for p2: p2 must be in l2_1. So we need to get p2 to l2_1. Since p2 starts in l2_2, which is in c2. So drive t2 (which is in l2_4) to l2_2, load p2 into t2, then drive t2 to l2_1, unload. Now p2 is in l2_1, which satisfies the first constraint. Then, according to the implication, in that state or after, p2 must be in a1 or t2. But after unloading p2 into l2_1, if we load it into a2 (which is there), then p2 is in a2, satisfying another constraint (third constraint: p2 in a2 must hold at some state). Then, the fourth constraint says that if p2 is in a2 in some state, then it must end up in l2_6. But wait, the final goal is p2 in l1_2, which is in c1. So there's a conflict here. Because if we load p2 into a2, then according to constraint 4, p2 must eventually be in l2_6. But our goal is to have p2 in l1_2. That's a problem.

Wait, the final goal is for p2 to be in l1_2. But constraint 4 says that if p2 is in a2, then it must end up in l2_6. So how can we have p2 in a2 and then get it to l1_2? Unless that constraint allows for after the state where p2 is in a2, it can be moved to l2_6 and then later moved again. But the final goal is l1_2, so this would require moving p2 from l2_6 to l1_2, which is in another city. So perhaps we need to avoid having p2 in a2, but that's impossible because one of the constraints is that p2 must be in a2 at some state.

Wait, the third constraint is: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'Package p2 is in a2'". So p2 must be loaded into a2 at some point. But according to constraint 4, once p2 is in a2, it must eventually reach l2_6. However, the final goal requires p2 to be in l1_2. So the plan must include p2 being in a2 (and then going to l2_6) and then somehow transported to l1_2. But how?

Alternatively, maybe after p2 is in a2, it's flown to l1_1 (c1's airport). But then, when we unload p2 from a2 at l1_1, that would make p2 be in l1_1. Then, use truck t1 to drive to l1_1, load p2, drive to l1_2, unload. But according to constraint 4, after p2 is in a2, it must be in l2_6. So that's a problem. Because if we fly a2 with p2 from l2_1 to l1_1, then when we unload p2 into l1_1, it's not in l2_6. So that violates constraint 4.

Therefore, the plan must include p2 being in a2, then at some point p2 must be in l2_6. But then how to get p2 from l2_6 to l1_2 (c1)? That would require another airplane trip. But that's possible. Let's outline:

1. For p2:

   a. Start in l2_2 (c2).

   b. Use truck t2 (located in l2_4) to drive to l2_2, load p2 into t2.

   c. Drive t2 to l2_1 (airport in c2), unload p2. Now p2 is in l2_1 (satisfies constraint 1).

   d. Load p2 into a2 (since a2 is at l2_1), satisfying constraint 3 (p2 in a2).

   e. Now, due to constraint 4, after this, p2 must be in l2_6. So fly a2 to l2_6? Wait, but airports are specific. Wait, the problem statement says that each city has one airport. Wait, the original state lists "airport l1_1" and "airport l2_1". So airports are l1_1 (c1) and l2_1 (c2). So airplanes can only land at these airports. So other locations are non-airports. So when you fly an airplane, you can only go from one airport to another. So a2 can fly from l2_1 to l1_1 (c1's airport), but not to l2_6, which is a regular location. Therefore, the airplane can't land at l2_6. So the only way to get p2 to l2_6 is via truck in c2.

So after p2 is in a2 (in l2_1), we can't fly to l2_6. So perhaps we need to unload p2 from a2 in l2_1, then use truck t2 to move it to l2_6. But that would mean that after loading p2 into a2 (satisfying constraint 3), we unload it back into l2_1. Then, drive t2 (which is in l2_1 after previous steps) to l2_6 and unload. But then the constraint 4 would be satisfied because after p2 was in a2, it ends up in l2_6. But then, how does p2 get to l1_2? That's the goal. So after l2_6, p2 would need to be loaded into an airplane again, perhaps a2, to fly to c1's airport l1_1, then use truck t1 to take it to l1_2.

But this seems complicated. Let me see:

So steps for p2:

- Start in l2_2.

- t2 is in l2_4. Drive t2 to l2_2, load p2 into t2.

- Drive t2 to l2_1 (airport), unload p2. Now p2 is in l2_1 (satisfies constraint 1).

- Load p2 into a2 (now satisfies constraint 3: p2 in a2).

- Now, per constraint 4: after this, p2 must reach l2_6. So how?

But a2 is in l2_1 (can't move to non-airport locations). So perhaps unload p2 from a2 back into l2_1. Then, drive t2 (which is now in l2_1) to l2_6, unload p2 there. That satisfies constraint 4. But then p2 is in l2_6, which is not the final goal. The final goal is l1_2. So from l2_6, p2 needs to be transported to c1. But how? Since trucks can't move between cities. So another airplane is needed. So after p2 is in l2_6, load it into a2 (if a2 is back in l2_1?), but wait, a2 is in l2_1. So t2 can drive to l2_6, load p2, drive back to l2_1, unload, then load into a2, fly to l1_1. Then use t1 to move to l1_1, load p2, drive to l1_2, unload.

But that's a lot of steps. Also, need to make sure all constraints are met.

Let's check the other constraints for p2:

Another constraint: "Package p2 is in t2" must hold at least once. So when we load p2 into t2 initially, that satisfies this. Also, if p2 is in t2 at some state, then after that, p2 must be in l1_7. But l1_7 is in c1. Wait, how? Because t2 is in c2. So if p2 is in t2 (c2's truck), then to get to l1_7 (c1), that's impossible unless p2 is moved via airplane. So perhaps after p2 is in t2 (when moving from l2_2 to l2_1), we have to ensure that later, p2 is moved to l1_7. But l1_7 is where t1 starts. So maybe after p2 is in l1_1 (c1's airport), load it into t1, drive to l1_7 (but that's where t1 starts, so maybe drive to l1_2 directly). Wait, the goal is l1_2. So perhaps after p2 is in t1, drive t1 to l1_2 and unload. But how does p2 get into t1?

Let's try to outline the steps:

For p2:

1. t2 starts in l2_4.

2. Drive t2 to l2_2 (load p2 into t2: satisfies "p2 is in t2" constraint).

3. Drive t2 to l2_1 (unload p2 here: now p2 is in l2_1, satisfying first constraint).

4. Load p2 into a2 (satisfies "p2 in a2" constraint).

5. Now, due to constraint 4, after this, p2 must reach l2_6. But how? Since a2 can't go to l2_6. So unload p2 from a2 into l2_1 again, then drive t2 to l2_1 (wait, t2 is already in l2_1 from step 3). So drive t2 to l2_6 (if possible). Are l2_1 and l2_6 in the same city? Yes, both are in c2. So the truck can drive between them.

Wait, cities are c1 and c2. All l2_* locations are in c2. So t2 can drive from l2_1 to l2_6. So steps:

5. Unload p2 from a2 into l2_1.

6. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_6, load p2 into t2 (but wait, p2 is in l2_1, so need to load into t2 while both are in l2_1. Wait, step 5 is unloading p2 into l2_1. Then, t2 is in l2_1. So step 6: load p2 into t2 again (so p2 is back in t2). Then drive t2 to l2_6 and unload. That would make p2 in l2_6, satisfying constraint 4. But then, after that, how to get p2 to l1_2?

Alternatively, after step 4 (p2 is in a2), fly a2 to l1_1 (c1's airport). Then unload p2 into l1_1. Then, use truck t1 (which is in l1_7) to drive to l1_1, load p2, drive to l1_2, unload. But according to constraint 4, after p2 is in a2 (step 4), it must reach l2_6. So this approach would violate that, because p2 is taken to l1_1 and then l1_2, not l2_6.

So this suggests that the plan must have p2 reach l2_6 at some point after being in a2. Therefore, after loading into a2, we have to fly to l2_6? But airplanes can only land at airports. l2_6 is a regular location, not an airport. So that's impossible. Therefore, the only way is to unload p2 from a2 into l2_1 (the airport), then use truck t2 to take it to l2_6.

So steps for p2 after being in a2:

5. Unload p2 from a2 into l2_1.

6. Now, p2 is in l2_1. Drive t2 (which is in l2_1) to l2_6, unload p2. Now p2 is in l2_6 (satisfies constraint 4).

But then the goal is to have p2 in l1_2. So we need to get p2 from l2_6 back to c1. So again, load into a2 (if it's in l2_1), fly to l1_1, unload, then truck to l1_2.

So steps 7-10:

7. Drive t2 from l2_6 back to l2_1.

8. Load p2 into a2 again (but this would require a2 to be in l2_1; if we flew a2 somewhere else, we need to fly it back).

Wait, after step 4 (loading p2 into a2), did we fly a2 anywhere? No. So a2 is still in l2_1. So steps:

4. Load p2 into a2 (a2 is in l2_1).

5. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1 (c1's airport). Then unload p2 into l1_1. But this would violate constraint 4, because after p2 is in a2 (step4), it needs to reach l2_6. But if we fly to l1_1, that's not l2_6. So that's a problem.

Alternatively, after step4, a2 flies to l2_1 (but it's already there). Then unload p2 into l2_1. Then drive t2 to l2_6. That would make p2 reach l2_6. Then, after that, how to get to l1_2?

So after step6 (p2 in l2_6), we have to move it to c1. So:

7. Load p2 into t2 again (if t2 is in l2_6).

8. Drive t2 to l2_1.

9. Unload p2 into l2_1.

10. Load p2 into a2.

11. Fly a2 to l1_1.

12. Unload p2 into l1_1.

13. Drive t1 from l1_7 to l1_1.

14. Load p2 into t1.

15. Drive t1 to l1_2.

16. Unload p2.

This way, all constraints are met. But this is very long, and perhaps there's a shorter way.

But perhaps there's a better way. Let's think again.

What if p2's path is:

l2_2 (initial) → t2 (driven to l2_1) → l2_1 (unload) → a2 (load) → fly to l1_1 (but this violates constraint4). So this can't be done.

Alternatively, after loading into a2, fly to l2_1 (no, already there), unload, then truck to l2_6. Then, fly a2 to l1_1 again, but p2 is in l2_6. So need to truck p2 back to l2_1, load into a2, fly to l1_1, then truck to l1_2.

But this is getting complicated. Let's check all constraints again for p2:

Constraints for p2:

1. Must be in l2_1 at least once. (We can achieve this by driving t2 to l2_1 and unloading there.)

2. If in l2_1, then in that state or after, p2 is in a1 or t2. So when p2 is in l2_1 (unloaded from t2), we need to load it into either a1 or t2. But a1 is in c1's airport. So unless a1 is flown to l2_1, which is possible. So perhaps after unloading p2 into l2_1, load it into a1 (but a1 is initially in l1_1). So fly a1 to l2_1, load p2 into a1, then fly back. But that's more steps. Alternatively, load into t2 again (if t2 is still in l2_1). So when p2 is unloaded into l2_1 (step3), then in the same state, p2 is in l2_1. The constraint says that if p2 is in l2_1 in state s, then in s or after, p2 must be in a1 or t2. So after unloading p2 into l2_1 (state s), the next action should be loading into a2 (but that's not a1 or t2). Or loading into t2 again. Wait, if we load p2 into t2 again, then the constraint is satisfied because in the next state, p2 is in t2.

So perhaps after unloading p2 into l2_1 (satisfies constraint1), then immediately load it into t2 again. Then, constraint2 is satisfied because in state s (where p2 is in l2_1), the next state has p2 in t2, which satisfies "at s or after".

But this would require that after unloading into l2_1, we load back into t2. Then drive t2 to l2_6 and unload. Then, since p2 is in l2_6, but the final goal is l1_2, we need to get it to c1. But how? Since l2_6 is in c2, we need to use an airplane again. So load into a2 (which is in l2_1?), but t2 would have to drive back to l2_1. So:

Steps for p2:

1. t2 drives from l2_4 to l2_2 (load p2 into t2: satisfies "p2 in t2" constraint).

2. t2 drives to l2_1 (unload p2: now in l2_1, constraint1 met).

3. Now, to satisfy constraint2, load p2 into t2 again (since a1 is in c1, not available here). So load p2 into t2 (now p2 is in t2 again).

4. Drive t2 to l2_6 and unload (now p2 is in l2_6: satisfies constraint4 after being in a2? Wait, no. Because p2 was in a2 only if step3 was loading into a2. But in this path, p2 is loaded into t2 again, not a2. So constraint3 (p2 must be in a2) is not met yet.

Ah, right. So we need to have p2 in a2 at some point. So perhaps after step2 (unload into l2_1), load into a2 (satisfies constraint3), then unload into l2_1 again (but this would require flying a2, which is still in l2_1). Or fly a2 to another airport, but then we can't unload into l2_1 anymore.

Wait, if after loading into a2 (step3), fly a2 to l1_1. Then unload p2 into l1_1. But then constraint4 requires p2 to be in l2_6 after being in a2. But now it's in l1_1. So that's a problem.

Alternative approach: After loading p2 into a2 (step3), fly a2 to l2_1 (no movement), then unload p2 into l2_1 again. Then drive t2 to l2_6. But this seems redundant. So steps:

1. t2 drives to l2_2, loads p2.

2. t2 drives to l2_1, unloads p2 (constraint1 met).

3. Load p2 into a2 (constraint3 met).

4. Now, due to constraint4, p2 must reach l2_6. So we need to get p2 from a2 to l2_6. But a2 can't move to l2_6. So unload p2 into l2_1 (where a2 is), then drive t2 to l2_1, load p2 into t2, drive to l2_6, unload. That way, after being in a2 (step3), p2 is unloaded into l2_1, then moved via t2 to l2_6 (satisfying constraint4).

Then, after that, to get p2 to l1_2, we need to fly it to c1. So:

5. Drive t2 from l2_6 back to l2_1 (so we can load p2 into a2 again).

6. Load p2 into a2 again (but why? Because we need to fly to c1's airport. So fly a2 to l1_1.

7. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.

8. Unload p2 into l1_1.

9. Then, use t1 to transport to l1_2. So drive t1 from l1_7 to l1_1.

10. Load p2 into t1 (satisfies "p1 is in t1"? Wait, no, p1 is a different package. But for p2, this is okay.

11. Drive t1 to l1_2, unload p2. Goal achieved.

But wait, what about the constraint that if p2 is in t2 (step1), then after that, p2 must be in l1_7. Because another constraint says: "If Package p2 is in t2 holds in some state s, then Package p2 is in location l1_7 must hold at s or at some state after s". Wait, l1_7 is in c1, and t2 is in c2. So how can p2 be in t2 (c2's truck) and then end up in l1_7 (c1's location)? That requires moving p2 from c2 to c1, which can only be done via airplane.

So when p2 is in t2 (step1), after that, we need to ensure that eventually p2 is in l1_7. But in the current plan, after step1, p2 is in t2, then in step2, unloaded into l2_1. So the constraint is that if p2 is in t2 at any state (like step1), then after that, p2 must reach l1_7. So after step1, p2 is in t2. So in the subsequent steps, we must ensure that p2 eventually reaches l1_7. But in the plan outlined above, p2 is moved to l1_1 (c1's airport) via a2, then to l1_2 via t1. But l1_7 is the initial location of t1. So to get p2 to l1_7, we need to drive t1 to l1_7 after loading p2. But that's possible.

Wait, the final goal is to have p2 in l1_2. But the constraint says that after p2 is in t2 (step1), it must eventually be in l1_7. So after step1, p2 is in t2. Then, after steps, when p2 is in l1_1 (from flying), load into t1 (which is in l1_7?), no. t1 starts in l1_7. So after p2 is in l1_1, drive t1 from l1_7 to l1_1, load p2 into t1, then drive to l1_2 (unload there). But then p2 is never in l1_7. So to satisfy the constraint, after step1 (p2 in t2), we need to have p2 in l1_7 at some point. How?

So maybe after p2 is in l1_1 (unloaded from a2), we load it into t1 and drive to l1_7, unload (satisfying the constraint), then drive back to l1_2 and unload again. But that adds steps. Let's see:

Steps after p2 is in l1_1:

9. Drive t1 from l1_7 to l1_1.

10. Load p2 into t1.

11. Drive t1 to l1_7 (unload p2: now in l1_7, satisfying the constraint).

12. Drive t1 to l1_2, load p2 again, then unload. But that's redundant. Alternatively, after step11, drive t1 to l1_2 and unload. Wait, but if we unload in l1_7, then drive to l1_2 with p2 still in t1? No. So steps:

9. Drive t1 from l1_7 to l1_1.

10. Load p2 into t1.

11. Drive t1 to l1_7, unload p2. Now p2 is in l1_7.

12. Load p2 into t1 again.

13. Drive t1 to l1_2, unload.

This way, after step1 (p2 in t2), eventually p2 reaches l1_7 (step11), satisfying the constraint. But this adds more steps.

This is getting quite complex. Maybe there's a more optimal path.

Let's consider the packages one by one, trying to find an optimal path that satisfies all constraints.

Starting with p1:

Goal: p1 in l2_6 (c2).

Initial location: p1 in l2_8 (c2).

Constraints for p1:

- At least once: p1 is in t1 (c1's truck).

- At least once: p1 is in either l1_6 or l2_3.

So p1 has to be in t1 (which is in c1) and in either l1_6 (c1) or l2_3 (c2) at some point.

But the goal is l2_6 (c2). So p1's path must involve moving to c1, then back to c2? Seems complicated.

Wait, how can p1 get into t1? t1 is in c1. So p1 must be transported from c2 to c1, loaded into t1, then transported back to c2. Or maybe after being in t1, it's taken to l1_6 (c1), then transported back to c2.

But how to do that.

Possible steps for p1:

1. Load p1 into a truck in c2 (t2), drive to airport l2_1.

2. Load into a2, fly to l1_1.

3. Unload into l1_1, load into t1 (satisfies "p1 in t1" constraint).

4. Drive t1 to l1_6, unload (satisfies the "p1 in l1_6" constraint).

5. Load p1 back into t1, drive to l1_1.

6. Load into a1, fly to l2_1.

7. Unload into l2_1, load into t2, drive to l2_6, unload. Goal achieved.

This would satisfy all constraints for p1.

But this is a lot of steps. Let's check if this is necessary.

Alternatively, perhaps p1 can be loaded into a2 in c2, flown to c1's airport, then into t1, driven to l1_6, then back to airport, flown to c2, then driven to l2_6.

But this seems lengthy.

But given the constraints, this might be the only way.

Now, combining the steps for both packages:

But the challenge is to interleave their steps optimally.

But given the complexity, perhaps the optimal plan is as follows:

For p1:

- Move from l2_8 to l2_1 via t2, load into a2, fly to l1_1, load into t1 (satisfies "p1 in t1"), drive to l1_6 (satisfies location constraint), then fly back to c2 via a1, drive to l2_6.

For p2:

- Move from l2_2 to l2_1 via t2, load into a2 (satisfies "p2 in a2"), then fly to l1_1, load into t1, drive to l1_2.

But need to ensure all constraints are met, including for p2 the requirement that after being in a2, it must be in l2_6. Which complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to have p2 in a2, fly to l2_1 (but that's already there), unload, then move to l2_6 via truck, then move to c1.

But this seems conflicting.

This is getting quite involved. Given the time constraints, perhaps I should try to outline the steps that satisfy all constraints and the goals.

Let me try to draft a possible plan:

For p2:

1. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_2.

2. Load p2 into t2. (satisfies "p2 in t2" constraint)

3. Drive t2 to l2_1. (now p2 is in l2_1, satisfies constraint1)

4. Unload p2 into l2_1. (now p2 is in l2_1)

5. Load p2 into a2. (satisfies constraint3)

6. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.

7. Unload p2 into l1_1.

8. Drive t1 from l1_7 to l1_1.

9. Load p2 into t1. 

10. Drive t1 to l1_2.

11. Unload p2. (goal met for p2)

But this violates constraint4, because after step5 (p2 in a2), p2 must reach l2_6. But in this plan, p2 ends up in l1_2. So this is invalid.

So we need to adjust.

Alternative approach for p2:

After step5 (p2 in a2), fly a2 to l2_1 (no movement), unload p2 into l2_1.

6. Unload p2 from a2 into l2_1.

7. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_6.

8. Load p2 into t2.

9. Drive t2 to l2_6, unload. (now p2 is in l2_6, satisfying constraint4)

10. Now, to get p2 to l1_2:

11. Drive t2 from l2_6 to l2_1.

12. Load p2 into a2.

13. Fly a2 to l1_1.

14. Unload p2 into l1_1.

15. Drive t1 from l1_7 to l1_1.

16. Load p2 into t1.

17. Drive t1 to l1_2.

18. Unload p2.

This satisfies constraint4 (p2 reaches l2_6 after being in a2), and the goal.

But this is very long. Also, we need to satisfy the constraint that after p2 is in t2 (step2), it must reach l1_7. In this plan, p2 is in t2 during steps2 and 7-8. So after step2 (when p2 is in t2), we need to ensure that eventually p2 is in l1_7. But in this plan, p2 ends up in l1_2. So how?

Ah, right. The constraint says: If p2 is in t2 in some state s, then p2 must be in l1_7 at s or after. So after step2 (p2 in t2), we need to eventually have p2 in l1_7. But in the current plan, after step2, p2 is moved to l2_1, then to a2, then to l2_6, then back to a2, then to l1_1, then to t1, then to l1_2. So p2 never goes to l1_7. Thus, violating the constraint.

To fix this, after p2 is loaded into t1 (step16), drive t1 to l1_7, unload, then drive to l1_2.

So modifying steps:

17. Drive t1 to l1_7, unload p2. (now in l1_7, satisfying the constraint)

18. Load p2 into t1 again.

19. Drive to l1_2, unload.

This adds more steps but satisfies the constraint.

Now, for p1:

Initial location: l2_8 (c2). Needs to go to l2_6 (c2). Also, must be in t1 (c1's truck) and in l1_6 or l2_3 at some point.

Steps for p1:

1. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_8. (t2 was used earlier for p2, but in the current plan, after step11, t2 is in l2_1. So perhaps after step11, we can reuse t2 for p1.)

Wait, the steps for p2 in the plan above would have t2 in l2_1 after step11. So for p1:

1. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_8.

2. Load p1 into t2.

3. Drive t2 to l2_1.

4. Load p1 into a2.

5. Fly a2 to l1_1.

6. Unload p1 into l1_1.

7. Drive t1 from l1_7 to l1_1.

8. Load p1 into t1. (satisfies "p1 in t1" constraint)

9. Drive t1 to l1_6. Unload. (satisfies location constraint)

10. Load p1 into t1.

11. Drive to l1_1.

12. Load p1 into a1.

13. Fly a1 to l2_1.

14. Unload p1 into l2_1.

15. Load p1 into t2.

16. Drive t2 to l2_6.

17. Unload p1. (goal met)

This would satisfy p1's constraints and goal.

But this is very long. Also, considering that airplanes and trucks are shared between packages, need to interleave steps carefully.

But perhaps there's a more optimal way. For example, after handling p2, use a2 to fly p1 to c1.

But this is getting too complicated. Given the time, I'll try to outline a possible plan that meets all constraints, even if it's lengthy.

Final Plan Steps:

For p2:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2

2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2

4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

5. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

6. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

7. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

8. drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_1 c1

9. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

10. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_7 c1

11. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_7

12. drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_1 c1

13. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

14. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1

15. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

For p1:

16. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_8 c2

17. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_8

18. drivetruck t2 l2_8 l2_1 c2

19. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

20. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

21. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

22. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

23. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_6 c1

24. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_6

25. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_6

26. drivetruck t1 l1_6 l1_1 c1

27. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

28. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

29. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

30. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

31. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_6 c2

32. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_6

But this is way too long. Also, steps for p2 and p1 are interleaved, which may not be optimal. Perhaps there's a way to optimize.

Alternatively, use airplanes for both packages. For example:

For p2:

1. t2 drives to l2_2, loads p2.

2. drives to l2_1, unloads.

3. load into a2.

4. fly to l1_1.

5. unload.

6. load into t1.

7. drive to l1_7 (satisfy constraint for p2 in t2).

8. unload.

9. drive to l1_2.

10. unload.

For p1:

11. t2 drives to l2_8, loads p1.

12. drives to l2_1, loads into a2.

13. fly to l1_1.

14. unload into t1.

15. drive to l1_6, unload.

16. drive back to l1_1.

17. load into a1.

18. fly to l2_1.

19. unload into t2.

20. drive to l2_6.

But this still has many steps.

Given the time constraints, I'll try to write the plan as per the initial steps, making sure all constraints are met.
