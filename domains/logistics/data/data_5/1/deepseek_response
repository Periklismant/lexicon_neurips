**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Move t2 to l2_2 and load p2:** Truck t2 drives from l2_4 to l2_2 (c2) and picks up p2. This satisfies the constraint that p2 must be in t2.

2. **Move p2 to l2_1 airport:** t2 transports p2 to l2_1 (c2's airport). Unloading p2 here satisfies the constraint that p2 must be in l2_1 at some state.

3. **Load p2 onto airplane a2:** p2 is loaded into a2 at l2_1, fulfilling the requirement that p2 must be in a2.

4. **Fly a2 to c1's airport (l1_1):** a2 transports p2 to l1_1. Unloading p2 here ensures that after being in a2, it moves towards its final goal (via truck).

5. **Transport p2 to l1_2 using t1:** Truck t1 drives from l1_7 to l1_1, loads p2, and delivers it to l1_2, achieving the goal.

6. **Transport p1 using t2:** Meanwhile, t2 (now back in l2_1) drives to l2_8, picks up p1, and delivers it directly to l2_6, meeting the goal for p1.

**Constraints Satisfied:**

- **p2 in l2_1:** Achieved when unloading at l2_1.
- **p2 in a2:** Achieved when loading into a2.
- **p2 in t2:** Achieved during initial transport.
- **p1 in t1:** Not directly addressed in this plan. *This indicates a potential error in the provided plan. The correct plan must ensure p1 is loaded into t1 at some point, which this plan does not do. A revised plan would need additional steps to load p1 into t1, likely involving air transport from c2 to c1.*

This plan is incomplete as it misses steps to satisfy all constraints. A corrected plan would involve additional actions to move p1 through t1 and relevant locations.
