Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. The goal is to get p1 to l1_1 and p2 to l1_2, while satisfying all the constraints. First, I need to understand the initial state and the constraints thoroughly.

Starting with the initial state:

- Locations:
  - c1 has l1_1 (airport), l1_2 to l1_8.
  - c2 has l2_1 (airport), l2_2 to l2_8.
  
- Packages:
  - p1 is at l1_5 (c1).
  - p2 is at l1_8 (c1).
  - t1 is at l1_3 (c1). Wait, wait, the original state says "Package t1 is in location l1_3". Wait, t1 is a truck, right? Oh, there's a mistake here. Let me check again. The user wrote:

The original state includes:
- "Package t1 is in location l1_3"
- "Package t2 is in location l2_2"
- "Package p1 is in location l1_5"
- "Package p2 is in location l1_8"
- "Package a1 is in location l1_1"
- "Package a2 is in location l2_1"

Wait, that can't be right. Because t1 and t2 are trucks, a1 and a2 are airplanes. So the user probably made a typo here. They probably meant:

"Truck t1 is in location l1_3"

Similarly for the others. But the way it's written, the objects are listed as package p1, p2, t1, t2, a1, a2. But that's conflicting because t1, t2 are trucks, a1, a2 are airplanes. So this must be a mistake in the problem statement. Let me recheck.

Looking back: The objects are defined as:

"package p1"

"package p2"

"truck t1"

"truck t2"

"airplane a1"

"airplane a2"

So the original state entries like "Package t1 is in location l1_3" are incorrect. Because t1 is a truck, not a package. This must be a typo. The correct original state should have:

"Truck t1 is in location l1_3"

Similarly for t2, a1, a2. Otherwise, the initial state is impossible because you can't have a package named t1. This is a critical error. But since the problem is given as such, perhaps I need to proceed under the assumption that it's a typo, and the correct initial positions are:

- Truck t1 is at l1_3 (c1)
- Truck t2 is at l2_2 (c2)
- Airplane a1 is at l1_1 (c1's airport)
- Airplane a2 is at l2_1 (c2's airport)
- Packages p1 at l1_5, p2 at l1_8.

Assuming that, because otherwise the problem is impossible. Otherwise, if t1 is a package, then we can't use it as a truck. So I'll proceed under the assumption that the original state entries for t1, t2, a1, a2 are actually their locations as trucks and airplanes, not packages.

So correcting the original state:

- Truck t1 is at l1_3 (c1)
- Truck t2 is at l2_2 (c2)
- Airplane a1 is at l1_1 (c1's airport)
- Airplane a2 is at l2_1 (c2's airport)
- Packages p1 at l1_5, p2 at l1_8.

Now, the goal is to get p1 to l1_1 and p2 to l1_2. Both are in c1.

Constraints:

1. At least once, p2 is in a1.
2. At least once, p1 is in t1.
3. If p1 is in t1 in some state s, then p2 is in l1_1 at s or after.
4. At least once, p2 is in l2_3 or p1 is in l1_7.
5. At least once, p2 is in l1_8.
6. If p2 is in l1_8 in s, then p1 is in t1 at s or after.
7. At least once, p2 is in t1.
8. If p2 is in t1 in s, then p1 is in a2 at s or after.

These constraints must all be satisfied in the plan.

Let's break them down.

First, the main goal: p1 at l1_1 (which is the airport of c1), and p2 at l1_2 (a location in c1).

Possible plan steps:

To move p1 to l1_1, which is an airport. Since l1_1 is in c1, perhaps using truck t1 (which is at l1_3) to drive to l1_5, load p1, drive to l1_1, unload. But l1_1 is an airport. Wait, but can a truck go to the airport? Yes, because airports are locations within the city. So yes, the truck can drive to l1_1.

But maybe using an airplane. If p1 is loaded into a plane at l1_1, but how would it get there? Alternatively, maybe p1 is moved via truck to the airport, then loaded into a plane. But the goal is to have p1 at l1_1, which is the airport. So maybe just drive the truck to l1_1 and unload there.

Similarly for p2: need to get to l1_2. Which is in c1, so truck t1 can be used.

But there are constraints that complicate things.

Constraints:

1. p2 must be in a1 at some point. So a1 is the airplane at l1_1. So we need to load p2 into a1. But a1 is at l1_1. So how does p2 get to l1_1? Since p2 starts at l1_8 (c1), maybe use truck t1 to transport it to l1_1, load into a1, then unload back. But why? Because the constraint says p2 must be in a1 at least once. But the goal is to have p2 at l1_2. So perhaps after loading into a1, we unload it again and then move to l1_2.

But that's an extra step. Let's think.

Also, constraint 3: Whenever p1 is in t1, then after that or at the same time, p2 must be in l1_1. So if we load p1 into t1 (at l1_5, for example), then after that, p2 must be in l1_1 at some point. So maybe after loading p1 into t1, we need to have p2 arrive at l1_1. Then we can proceed to unload p1 at l1_1.

Constraint 4: At least once, p2 is in l2_3 (c2) or p1 in l1_7 (c1). But l2_3 is in c2, which is a different city. So to get p2 to l2_3, we need to transport it to c2. But the goal is to have p2 in l1_2. So that would mean moving p2 to c2 and then back. That's possible via airplane. Similarly, moving p1 to l1_7 (c1) is another option. Let's see which is easier.

Constraint 5: At least once, p2 is in l1_8. But p2 starts at l1_8. So unless we move it away and back, this constraint is already satisfied in the initial state. Wait, but the initial state says p2 is at l1_8. So if the constraint requires that in at least one state (including initial), then this is already satisfied. But the problem says "must hold in at least one state", so maybe the initial state counts. However, the user might have intended that the plan must include a state where p2 is in l1_8. If the initial state counts, then constraint 5 is satisfied. But if the plan must have p2 in l1_8 at some point during execution, then since the initial state is before the plan starts, maybe the plan doesn't include the initial state. Wait, in planning, the initial state is state 0, and the plan's actions are executed starting from state 0. So any condition that must hold in at least one state can be the initial state if applicable. So for constraint 5, if the initial state has p2 in l1_8, then the constraint is already satisfied. But the problem says "The following expression must hold in at least one state: Package p2 is in location l1_8". So if the initial state is considered, then this is already true. However, perhaps the problem expects the plan to include this state through its actions. The problem might not consider the initial state as part of the plan's states. Wait, no. In planning, the initial state is state 0, and each action leads to the next state. So the constraints refer to any state in the trajectory, including the initial state. Therefore, constraint 5 is already satisfied by the initial state, so we don't need to do anything for it. However, we need to check if the problem requires that the constraint must be true in at least one state of the plan's execution (including initial). If that's the case, then constraint 5 is already met, so no action needed. But we should confirm.

Similarly, constraint 6: If p2 is in l1_8 in some state s, then p1 is in t1 at s or after. But in the initial state, p2 is in l1_8, so we need to ensure that p1 is in t1 in the initial state or after. But in the initial state, p1 is at l1_5, not in t1. So constraint 6 requires that whenever p2 is in l1_8 (including the initial state), then p1 must be in t1 at that state or later. Since the initial state has p2 in l1_8 and p1 not in t1, we need to ensure that after the initial state, at some point p1 is in t1. Which is covered by constraint 2, which requires that p1 is in t1 at least once. So as long as we load p1 into t1 at some point after the initial state, constraint 6 is satisfied. Because the initial state s0 has p2 in l1_8, but in s0, p1 is not in t1. So the plan must include a state where p1 is in t1 after s0. Which is required by constraint 2. So constraint 6 is satisfied as long as constraint 2 is met, because the initial state's s0 would require that in s0 or after, p1 is in t1. But since s0 doesn't have p1 in t1, then after s0, there must be a state where p1 is in t1. Which is required by constraint 2. So that's okay.

Now, let's look at the constraints again:

Constraints:

1. p2 in a1 (a1 is in l1_1, c1's airport) at least once.

2. p1 in t1 at least once.

3. Whenever p1 is in t1 (in any state s), then p2 must be in l1_1 at s or after.

4. At least once, p2 in l2_3 (c2) or p1 in l1_7 (c1).

5. At least once, p2 in l1_8 (initial state satisfies this).

6. If p2 is in l1_8 (s), then p1 in t1 at s or after. Since s0 has p2 in l1_8 and p1 not in t1, the plan must have p1 in t1 after s0.

7. p2 in t1 at least once.

8. Whenever p2 is in t1 (s), then p1 must be in a2 (which is in l2_1, c2's airport) at s or after.

So, the plan must handle all these.

Let's outline the steps.

Main goal: p1 to l1_1, p2 to l1_2.

Possible steps for p1:

Option 1: Use truck t1 (located at l1_3) to drive to l1_5 (where p1 is), load p1 into t1, drive to l1_1, unload.

But then, according to constraint 3, when we load p1 into t1 (so p1 is in t1), then p2 must be in l1_1 at that state or later. So after loading p1 into t1, we need to get p2 to l1_1.

But p2 is at l1_8. To get p2 to l1_1, perhaps use truck t1. But t1 is already carrying p1. Wait, can a truck carry multiple packages? The problem doesn't say anything about capacity, so assuming yes. So, after loading p1 into t1, drive to l1_8, load p2 into t1, drive to l1_1, unload both. But that might work.

But also, constraint 1 requires p2 to be in a1. So after unloading p2 at l1_1, load it into a1 (which is at l1_1), then unload again. Then move p2 to l1_2.

But this complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps use a different truck for p2. But the other truck, t2, is in c2's l2_2. So not useful for c1.

So maybe t1 is the only truck in c1. So we have to use t1.

So steps for p1:

1. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_5 (current location of p1).

2. Load p1 into t1 at l1_5.

At this point, constraint 2 is satisfied (p1 in t1). Now, constraint 3 requires that p2 is in l1_1 now or later.

So after this, we need to ensure that p2 is moved to l1_1.

Also, constraint 7 requires that p2 is in t1 at least once. So perhaps we load p2 into t1 at some point.

But how?

p2 is at l1_8. So t1 would need to go to l1_8, load p2, then drive to l1_1. But t1 is already at l1_5 after step 1. So steps:

3. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_8.

4. Load p2 into t1 at l1_8. (Now p2 is in t1, satisfying constraint 7.)

Now, constraint 8: whenever p2 is in t1 (which is now), then p1 must be in a2 (which is in l2_1, c2's airport) at or after this state.

But p1 is currently in t1. So after this state, we need to have p1 loaded into a2. But a2 is in l2_1. How can we get p1 to a2? Since a2 is in c2, which is another city. So we would need to:

- Drive t1 (with p1 and p2) to l1_1 (airport).

- Unload p1 and p2 at l1_1.

- Load p1 into a1 (since a1 is at l1_1), then fly a1 to l2_1 (c2's airport), unload p1, then load into a2. But a2 is already at l2_1. Wait, a2 is at l2_1. So if a1 is flown to l2_1, unload p1 there, then load into a2. Then fly a2 back? But this seems complicated. But according to constraint 8, once p2 is in t1 (which is step 4), then p1 must be in a2 at some point after.

But this would require p1 to be in a2. So how?

Alternatively, after step 4 (p2 in t1), perhaps:

5. Drive t1 to l1_1 (airport).

6. Unload p1 and p2 at l1_1.

7. Load p2 into a1 (satisfying constraint 1).

8. Fly a1 to l2_1 (where a2 is).

9. Unload p2 from a1 into l2_1.

But that's not helpful. Or maybe, after unloading p1 and p2 at l1_1, load p1 into a1, fly to l2_1, then load into a2. But this would require multiple steps.

This seems complicated. Let's think of another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps we can handle constraint 8 by having p1 loaded into a2 after p2 is in t1.

But how to get p1 to a2? a2 is in l2_1 (c2's airport). So p1 would need to be transported to c2. To do that, we can:

- Load p1 into a1 at l1_1, fly a1 to l2_1, unload p1, then load into a2.

But why would we do that? Because constraint 8 requires that after p2 is in t1, p1 must be in a2.

So steps:

After step 4 (p2 in t1), we need to get p1 into a2.

But p1 is currently in t1. So steps:

5. Drive t1 to l1_1.

6. Unload p1 and p2 at l1_1.

7. Load p1 into a1.

8. Fly a1 to l2_1.

9. Unload p1 from a1 into l2_1.

10. Load p1 into a2 (since a2 is at l2_1).

This satisfies constraint 8 (after step 4, p2 in t1, then in steps 7-10, p1 is loaded into a2). However, this is getting very involved. Also, the goal is to have p1 in l1_1, but we just moved it to l2_1. So we need to bring it back.

This seems too long. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, maybe we can use the airplane a2 to transport p1, but a2 is in l2_1. So perhaps, after getting p1 into a2, fly a2 to l1_1. But airplanes can only land at airports, which are l1_1 and l2_1. So fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1, then unload p1 there. That would satisfy the goal.

So putting it all together:

Steps:

1. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_5.

2. Load p1 into t1. (Now constraint 2 is satisfied.)

3. Drive t1 to l1_8.

4. Load p2 into t1. (Now constraint 7 is satisfied.)

5. Drive t1 to l1_1.

6. Unload p1 and p2 at l1_1.

7. Load p2 into a1. (Constraint 1 satisfied.)

8. Fly a1 to l2_1.

9. Unload p2 from a1 into l2_1. (But now p2 is in c2, which is not helpful for the goal. So we need to get it back.)

But this complicates things. Alternatively, after step 6, we could:

7. Load p1 into a1.

8. Fly a1 to l2_1.

9. Unload p1 into l2_1.

10. Load p1 into a2. (Now constraint 8 is satisfied: after p2 was in t1 (step4), p1 is in a2 (step10).)

11. Fly a2 back to l1_1.

12. Unload p1 into l1_1. (Achieves goal for p1.)

Now, for p2, after step6, p2 is at l1_1. To get to l1_2, we can:

13. Load p2 into t1 (if t1 is at l1_1).

But t1 was driven to l1_1 in step5. So after unloading in step6, t1 is at l1_1.

14. Load p2 into t1.

15. Drive t1 to l1_2.

16. Unload p2. (Achieves goal for p2.)

But this adds steps. Also, we need to ensure all constraints.

Let's check all constraints:

1. p2 in a1: step7 is loading p2 into a1? Wait no. In step7, after step6, p1 is unloaded at l1_1. p2 is also there. Then in step7, we could load p2 into a1 (as per constraint1). So step7: loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1. Then fly a1 somewhere? Not necessary. Because constraint1 just requires p2 to be in a1 at least once. So even if we load and then unload immediately, that's okay. But then, after loading p2 into a1, we can unload it again.

Alternatively, step7: load p2 into a1, then step8: unload p2 from a1 into l1_1 again. But that's redundant. But it satisfies constraint1.

But perhaps instead, after step6 (p2 at l1_1), we can load it into a1 (step7), then fly a1 to l1_1? No, flying from l1_1 to l1_1 isn't allowed. Or perhaps fly to another airport? But the only other airport is l2_1. So maybe after loading p2 into a1, fly to l2_1, then fly back. But this is adding unnecessary steps. However, to satisfy constraint1, just loading p2 into a1 is enough. So even if we load and then immediately unload, that's acceptable.

So steps:

After step6 (p2 at l1_1):

7. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (now p2 is in a1, satisfying constraint1).

8. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (p2 back to l1_1).

Then proceed to move p2 to l1_2.

But the goal is to have p2 at l1_2, so:

9. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (since t1 is at l1_1).

10. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1.

11. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2.

Now, p2 is at l1_2, goal achieved.

But also, need to handle constraint4: at least once, p2 is in l2_3 or p1 in l1_7.

In the current plan, p1 is moved from l1_5 to l1_1 via truck, then to a1, flown to l2_1, loaded into a2, flown back to l1_1. So p1's path is l1_5 -> t1 -> l1_1 -> a1 -> l2_1 -> a2 -> l1_1. So p1 is in a2 (l2_1) at some point. But how does this affect constraint4?

Constraint4: p2 in l2_3 or p1 in l1_7. In the current plan, neither happens. So we need to add steps to satisfy this.

So we need to either get p2 to l2_3 or p1 to l1_7.

Option: Move p1 to l1_7. How?

p1 is initially at l1_5. To get to l1_7, can use truck t1. But in the current plan, t1 is used to carry p1 to l1_1. So perhaps in an alternate path.

Alternatively, after loading p1 into t1 (step2), drive t1 to l1_7 before going to l1_8.

But that would add steps. Let's see:

Modified steps:

1. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_5.

2. Load p1 into t1. (Constraint2 satisfied.)

3. Drive t1 to l1_7. (Now p1 is in t1 at l1_7. When we unload here, p1 is at l1_7, satisfying constraint4.)

But then we need to reload p1 into t1 to continue.

But this complicates the plan.

Alternatively, after step2, drive t1 to l1_7, unload p1 (so p1 is in l1_7), satisfying constraint4. Then load p1 again into t1.

But this adds steps. However, this would satisfy constraint4.

So steps:

After step2:

3. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_7 c1.

4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_7. (Now p1 is in l1_7, satisfying constraint4.)

5. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_7.

6. drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_8 c1.

7. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_8. (Constraint7 satisfied.)

Then proceed as before.

This adds steps but satisfies constraint4. However, this makes the plan longer. Is there a shorter way?

Alternatively, when moving p2, perhaps take it to l2_3. But p2 is in c1. To get to l2_3 (c2), we need to use an airplane. So steps:

After p2 is in l1_1 (step6), load into a1, fly to l2_1, then drive via truck t2 (in c2) to l2_3. But t2 is at l2_2. So:

After step6 (p2 at l1_1):

7. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1. (Constraint1 satisfied.)

8. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1.

9. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1.

10. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2. (t2 is at l2_2 initially.)

Wait, no: t2 is a truck in c2. The original state says "Package t2 is in location l2_2". Again, this must be a typo; t2 is a truck, so "Truck t2 is in location l2_2".

Assuming that, then t2 can drive to l2_1 (airport of c2), load p2, drive to l2_3, unload. Then p2 is in l2_3, satisfying constraint4. But then we need to get p2 back to c1's l1_2, which complicates the plan. This would require flying p2 back via airplane, but then the plan becomes very long.

But constraint4 requires that at least once, either p2 is in l2_3 or p1 is in l1_7. So choosing to satisfy this via p1 in l1_7 is better since it's in the same city.

So let's adjust the plan to include p1 being in l1_7.

Modified plan steps:

1. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_5.

2. Load p1 into t1. (Constraint2 met.)

3. Drive t1 to l1_7.

4. Unload p1 into l1_7. (Now p1 is in l1_7, satisfying constraint4.)

5. Load p1 back into t1.

6. Drive t1 to l1_8.

7. Load p2 into t1. (Constraint7 met.)

Now, after step7, p2 is in t1. So constraint8 requires that after this, p1 must be in a2.

So steps:

8. Drive t1 to l1_1.

9. Unload p1 and p2 at l1_1.

10. Load p1 into a1.

11. Fly a1 to l2_1.

12. Unload p1 into l2_1.

13. Load p1 into a2. (Now p1 is in a2, satisfying constraint8.)

14. Fly a2 to l1_1.

15. Unload p1 into l1_1. (Goal met for p1.)

Now, handling p2:

After step9, p2 is at l1_1. We need to get it to l1_2.

16. Load p2 into t1 (at l1_1).

17. Drive t1 to l1_2.

18. Unload p2. (Goal met.)

Also, constraint1 requires p2 to be in a1. So between steps9 and 16, we can load p2 into a1:

After step9 (p2 at l1_1):

10. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1. (Constraint1 met.)

11. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1. (Then proceed to load into t1.)

But this adds steps. Alternatively, during step10 in the previous plan, when we load p1 into a1, but that would require p2 to be at l1_1 and then loaded into a1.

Wait, after step9, p1 and p2 are at l1_1. So step10: load p1 into a1, step10a: load p2 into a1. But a1 can carry multiple packages? Assuming yes.

So steps:

9. Unload p1 and p2 at l1_1.

10. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1.

11. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1. (Now both p1 and p2 are in a1.)

12. Fly a1 to l2_1.

13. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1.

14. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1.

15. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1. (Assuming t2 is in l2_2, need to drive to l2_1.)

Wait, t2 is in l2_2. So:

15. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2.

16. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.

17. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2.

18. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3. (Now p2 is in l2_3, satisfying constraint4.)

But then we need to get p2 back to c1. This is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, after step9, p2 is at l1_1. We can load it into a1 (step10), then unload it back into l1_1 (step11), then proceed to move to l1_2.

But this satisfies constraint1.

So steps:

9. Unload p1 and p2 at l1_1.

10. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1. (Constraint1 met.)

11. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1.

12. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

13. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1.

14. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2.

Now, p2 is at l1_2, goal achieved.

Meanwhile, p1 is at l1_1 after step9. So we need to handle p1's movement to a2 to satisfy constraint8.

After step9, p1 is at l1_1. So steps for p1:

15. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1.

16. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1.

17. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1.

18. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1. (Now p1 is in a2, satisfying constraint8.)

19. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

20. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1. (Goal achieved.)

But this adds many steps. Is there a shorter way?

Alternative approach: Combine steps.

After step9 (p1 and p2 at l1_1):

10. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1. (Constraint1)

11. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1.

12. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1.

13. unload p1 and p2 from a1 at l2_1.

14. load p1 into a2. (Constraint8: after p2 was in t1 (step7), now p1 is in a2.)

15. fly a2 to l1_1.

16. unload p1 into l1_1.

For p2:

17. load p2 into t2 (if t2 is at l2_1).

But t2 is at l2_2. So:

17. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2.

18. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.

19. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2.

20. unload p2 into l2_3. (Satisfies constraint4.)

Then, to get p2 back to c1:

21. load p2 into a2 (if a2 is at l2_1 after step15? No, a2 is flown to l1_1 in step15. So a2 is at l1_1. So need to use another airplane.

Alternatively, use a1 again:

21. fly a1 l2_1 l1_1.

22. load p2 into a1.

23. fly a1 to l1_1.

24. unload p2 into l1_1.

Then, move to l1_2 via truck.

This is getting too long. The optimal plan should be as short as possible. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Alternative plan focusing on satisfying constraints with minimal steps:

1. Move t1 to l1_5, load p1 (constraint2 met).

2. Drive t1 to l1_7, unload p1 (constraint4 met).

3. Reload p1 into t1.

4. Drive to l1_8, load p2 (constraint7 met).

5. Drive to l1_1, unload both.

6. Load p2 into a1 (constraint1).

7. Unload p2 back into l1_1.

8. Load p1 into a1, fly to l2_1.

9. Unload p1, load into a2 (constraint8).

10. Fly a2 back to l1_1, unload p1 (goal).

11. Load p2 into t1, drive to l1_2, unload (goal).

This plan has 11 actions. Let's count the steps:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_5 c1

2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5

3. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_7 c1

4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_7

5. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_7

6. drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_8 c1

7. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_8

8. drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_1 c1

9. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

10. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

11. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

12. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

13. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

14. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

15. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

16. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

17. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

18. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

19. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

20. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1

21. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

This is 21 actions, which is too long. We need to find a shorter plan.

Let's think differently. Maybe use the airplanes more effectively.

Another approach:

- Use airplane a1 to move p2 to l2_3, satisfying constraint4.

But how?

Original positions:

p2 is at l1_8 (c1).

Steps:

1. Drive t1 to l1_8, load p2.

2. Drive to l1_1, unload p2.

3. Load p2 into a1.

4. Fly a1 to l2_1.

5. Unload p2 into l2_1.

6. Drive t2 (in c2) to l2_1, load p2.

7. Drive t2 to l2_3, unload p2. (Constraint4 met.)

But now p2 is in l2_3. To get it back to c1, need to load into a2 (at l2_1?), fly to l1_1, etc. This is getting too long.

Alternatively, after step5, fly a1 back to l1_1 with p2.

But this would not help. Alternatively, after step4, fly a1 to l2_1, unload p2, then fly back to l1_1 with p2. But why?

This approach seems too time-consuming.

Alternative idea: Use the fact that constraint4 requires either p2 in l2_3 or p1 in l1_7. If we can get p1 to l1_7 quickly.

Original p1 is at l1_5.

Steps:

1. Drive t1 to l1_5, load p1.

2. Drive to l1_7, unload p1. (Constraint4 met.)

3. Reload p1 into t1.

Now, proceed to handle other constraints.

This adds 3 steps but satisfies constraint4.

Then, proceed to move p1 to l1_1 and p2 to l1_2.

But also need to handle the other constraints.

Let's outline this:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_5 c1

2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 (constraint2)

3. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_7 c1

4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_7 (constraint4)

5. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_7

6. drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_8 c1

7. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_8 (constraint7)

8. drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_1 c1

9. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

10. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

Now, p1 and p2 are at l1_1.

Constraint1: p2 in a1. So:

11. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (constraint1)

12. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (optional, but need to move p2 to l1_2)

13. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

14. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1

15. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (goal)

For p1, since it's already at l1_1 (unloaded in step9), that's the goal.

But wait, after step9, p1 is at l1_1, which is the goal. So steps9 and 10 unload both packages.

But constraint8 requires that after p2 is in t1 (step7), p1 must be in a2 at or after.

In this plan, after step7 (p2 in t1), p1 is still in t1 until step9. So step9 unloads p1 into l1_1. So to satisfy constraint8, after step7, p1 must be in a2.

But in this plan, p1 is unloaded into l1_1, which is not a2. So this violates constraint8.

Thus, this plan is invalid.

Ah, here's a problem. So after step7 (p2 in t1), we must ensure that p1 is in a2 at some point after.

So steps after step7:

8. Drive t1 to l1_1.

9. Unload p1 and p2.

10. Load p1 into a1.

11. Fly a1 to l2_1.

12. Unload p1 into l2_1.

13. Load p1 into a2.

14. Fly a2 to l1_1.

15. Unload p1 into l1_1.

Now, this adds steps but satisfies constraint8.

So integrating this into the plan:

After step7 (p2 in t1):

8. drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_1 c1

9. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

10. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

11. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

12. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

13. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

14. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (now constraint8 is satisfied)

15. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

16. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (goal)

For p2:

17. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

18. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1

19. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (goal)

Also, constraint1 requires p2 in a1. So after step10, p2 is at l1_1. So step11 can be loading p2 into a1:

11. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (constraint1)

12. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

Then proceed to fly a1 with p1.

But this adds steps.

So steps would be:

After step10:

11. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (constraint1)

12. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

13. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

14. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

15. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

16. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

17. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

18. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

19. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

20. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1

21. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

This is 21 steps. But the problem requires an optimal plan (shortest possible). This seems too long. There must be a shorter way.

Alternative idea: Combine loading p1 into a2 without needing to fly a2 back.

But p1's goal is l1_1. So after loading into a2, which is at l2_1, we need to fly a2 to l1_1 to unload p1.

Alternatively, is there a way to have p1 in a2 at l1_1? For example, if a2 is flown to l1_1.

But a2 starts at l2_1. So steps:

Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1, then load p1 into a2 there.

But p1 is initially at l1_5. So steps:

1. Drive t1 to l1_5, load p1.

2. Drive to l1_1, unload.

3. Load p1 into a2.

But a2 is at l2_1. So this is not possible unless we move a2 to l1_1.

So:

Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1 (action: flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1).

Then load p1 into a2 at l1_1.

Then unload p1 at l1_1 (goal).

But this would require:

1. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

2. drive t1 to l1_5, load p1.

3. drive to l1_1, unload.

4. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1.

5. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1.

This achieves p1's goal. But also need to handle p2 and constraints.

But let's see if this can be integrated.

Plan for p1:

1. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1. (Now a2 is at l1_1.)

2. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_5 c1.

3. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5.

4. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1.

5. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1.

6. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1.

7. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1. (Goal met.)

This is 7 actions for p1.

For p2:

8. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_8 c1.

9. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_8. (Constraint7.)

10. drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_2 c1.

11. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2. (Goal met.)

But need to satisfy constraint8: if p2 is in t1 (step9), then p1 must be in a2 at or after.

In this plan, after step9, p1 is in a2 during steps6 and 7. So if step6 is before step9, then when p2 is loaded into t1 (step9), p1 has already been in a2 (step6). Does this satisfy the constraint?

The constraint says: if in state s, p2 is in t1, then p1 must be in a2 in s or after.

So if step9 is after step6, then when p2 is loaded into t1 (step9), p1 has already been in a2 (step6), which is before. But the constraint requires that p1 is in a2 in s or after. So if p1 was in a2 before s, does that satisfy the constraint? No, because the constraint requires that if p2 is in t1 in s, then p1 is in a2 in s or after. So p1 must be in a2 at the same time as s or later.

Therefore, in this plan, after step9 (s is step9), p1 is in a2 only in step6, which is before. So this violates constraint8.

Thus, this approach is invalid.

Alternative idea: After loading p2 into t1 (step9), ensure that p1 is loaded into a2 after that.

So steps:

1. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

2. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_5 c1.

3. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5.

4. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_8 c1.

5. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_8. (constraint7, s=step5)

6. drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_1 c1.

7. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1.

8. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

9. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1. (now p1 is in a2 after step5, satisfying constraint8.)

10. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1. (goal)

For p2:

11. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1. (constraint1)

12. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1.

13. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

14. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1.

15. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2. (goal)

Constraint4: need p2 in l2_3 or p1 in l1_7. In this plan, p1 was moved from l1_5 to l1_8 to l1_1. So p1 is never in l1_7. And p2 is never in l2_3. So this plan doesn't satisfy constraint4. Hence invalid.

Thus, we must include either moving p1 to l1_7 or p2 to l2_3.

Let's try to add a step where p1 is moved to l1_7.

Modified plan:

1. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

2. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_5 c1.

3. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5.

4. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_7 c1.

5. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_7. (constraint4)

6. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_7.

7. drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_8 c1.

8. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_8. (constraint7)

9. drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_1 c1.

10. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1.

11. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

12. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1. (constraint8: after step8, p2 in t1, now p1 in a2)

13. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1. (goal)

For p2:

14. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1. (constraint1)

15. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1.

16. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

17. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1.

18. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2. (goal)

Now, this plan includes moving p1 to l1_7 (step5), satisfying constraint4.

But let's count the steps:

1. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

2. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_5.

3. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5.

4. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_7.

5. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_7.

6. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_7.

7. drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_8.

8. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_8.

9. drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_1.

10. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1.

11. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

12. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1.

13. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1.

14. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1.

15. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1.

16. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

17. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2.

18. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2.

This is 18 steps. Still quite long. But maybe this is the optimal.

Check if all constraints are met:

1. p2 in a1: step14.

2. p1 in t1: step3,6.

3. Whenever p1 is in t1 (steps3,6), then p2 must be in l1_1 at or after.

- After step3 (p1 in t1), we eventually unload p2 at l1_1 (step11). So yes.

- After step6 (p1 in t1 again), same as above.

4. p1 in l1_7: step5.

5. p2 in l1_8: initial state (s0), but during the plan, p2 is moved from l1_8. However, the constraint requires that p2 is in l1_8 at least once. Since s0 is part of the state sequence, this is satisfied.

6. If p2 is in l1_8 (s0), then p1 must be in t1 at or after. In the plan, p1 is in t1 starting at step3, which is after s0. So satisfied.

7. p2 in t1: step8.

8. Whenever p2 is in t1 (step8), p1 must be in a2 at or after. step12 loads p1 into a2 after step8. Yes.

Thus, all constraints are satisfied.

But can we shorten this plan?

For example, combining steps where possible.

For example, after step9, t1 is at l1_1 with p1 and p2.

Instead of unloading both and then loading into a2 and a1, maybe find a way to combine.

But each action is atomic, so we can't combine unloading and loading in one step.

Another optimization: when driving t1 from l1_3 to l1_5, then to l1_7, l1_8, l1_1. Maybe reorder steps to minimize driving.

Alternatively, after loading p1 into t1 (step3), drive to l1_8 first, load p2, then go to l1_7, unload p1, reload, then to l1_1. But that might not save steps.

Alternatively:

1. fly a2 to l1_1.

2. drive t1 to l1_5, load p1.

3. drive to l1_8, load p2.

4. drive to l1_7, unload p1.

5. reload p1.

6. drive to l1_1, unload p1 and p2.

7. load p1 into a2.

8. unload p1.

9. load p2 into a1.

10. unload p2.

11. move p2 to l1_2.

This would reduce steps. Let's see:

1. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

2. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_5 c1

3. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5

4. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_8 c1

5. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_8 (constraint7)

6. drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_7 c1

7. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_7 (constraint4)

8. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_7

9. drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_1 c1

10. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

11. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

12. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (constraint8)

13. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (goal)

14. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (constraint1)

15. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

16. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

17. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1

18. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (goal)

This is 18 steps as well.

But perhaps we can eliminate some steps.

For instance, after step9 (t1 at l1_1), unload p1 and p2 (steps10-11). Then load p1 into a2 (step12), which is at l1_1. Then unload (step13). This achieves p1's goal.

For p2, after step11, p2 is at l1_1. Load into a1 (step14), unload (step15), then load into t1 and drive to l1_2.

But maybe step15 can be skipped. After loading p2 into a1 (step14), we can fly a1 to l1_1 (but it's already there). Or just unload p2 back to l1_1 (step15), then move via truck. But this adds steps.

Alternatively, after step14 (p2 in a1), fly a1 to l1_2? No, because airplanes can only land at airports. l1_2 is not an airport, so a1 can't fly there.

Thus, p2 must be moved via truck.

This seems unavoidable.

But is there a way to avoid unloading p2 from a1? For example, keep p2 in a1, but that doesn't help since the goal is to have p2 at l1_2, which is not an airport.

Thus, this plan seems to be as short as possible given the constraints.

Now, let's check the constraints again:

1. p2 in a1: step14.

2. p1 in t1: steps3,5,8.

3. Whenever p1 is in t1 (steps3,5,8), then p2 is in l1_1 (step11) after.

4. p1 in l1_7: step7.

5. p2 in l1_8: initial state.

6. If p2 is in l1_8 (initial state), then p1 is in t1 later (steps3, etc.).

7. p2 in t1: steps5,16.

8. When p2 is in t1 (step5), then p1 must be in a2 after. step12 occurs after step5, so satisfied.

Thus, all constraints are met.

Is this the shortest possible plan? Maybe. But perhaps there's a way to reduce steps.

Wait, in step1, flying a2 to l1_1 is necessary to load p1 into a2 later. But if we can load p1 into a2 without moving a2, but that's impossible since a2 starts at l2_1. So step1 is necessary.

Alternative idea: Use a1 to transport p1 to a2.

For example:

After unloading p1 at l1_1 (step10):

12. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1.

13. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1.

14. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1.

15. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (constraint8).

16. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

17. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1.

This achieves p1's goal and satisfies constraint8.

But this adds more steps than the previous approach.

Thus, the plan with 18 steps seems to be the minimal required to satisfy all constraints.

But perhaps there's a way to avoid moving a2 initially.

Alternative plan:

1. Drive t1 to l1_5, load p1.

2. Drive to l1_7, unload p1 (constraint4).

3. Load p1 back.

4. Drive to l1_8, load p2.

5. Drive to l1_1, unload both.

6. Load p2 into a1 (constraint1).

7. Load p1 into a1.

8. Fly a1 to l2_1.

9. Unload p1.

10. Load p1 into a2 (constraint8).

11. Fly a2 back to l1_1.

12. Unload p1 (goal).

13. Load p2 into t1, drive to l1_2, unload.

This would be:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_5

2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5

3. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_7

4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_7

5. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_7

6. drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_8

7. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_8

8. drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_1

9. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

10. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

11. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

12. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

13. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

14. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

15. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

16. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

17. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

18. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

19. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

But t2 is in c2. Wait, t2 is in l2_2. So to load p2 into t2, need to drive to l2_1.

19. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2

20. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

21. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2

22. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (constraint4)

But then p2 is in l2_3, which is in c2. To get back to c1, need to use an airplane again. This is getting even longer.

Thus, it seems that the previous plan with 18 steps is the shortest possible.

But the user mentioned that the plan must be optimal (shortest possible). So perhaps there's a smarter way.

Alternative Idea: Use the airplane a2 to carry p1 from l1_1 to l2_1 and back, but also satisfy constraint8.

Wait, after p2 is loaded into t1 (step7 in the original plan), we need to get p1 into a2. So perhaps after unloading p1 at l1_1, load it into a2 which is flown from l2_1 to l1_1.

But a2 starts at l2_1. So:

1. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

2. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1.

3. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1.

But this doesn't help.

Alternatively, after p1 is at l1_1 (unloaded from truck), load into a2 which is already there.

Wait, a2 starts at l2_1. So to load p1 into a2, a2 must be at l1_1. So steps:

1. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

2. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1. (constraint8)

3. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1. (goal)

But this requires flying a2 to l1_1 first.

Integrate this into the plan:

Let's try:

Plan Steps:

1. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

2. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_5 c1.

3. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5.

4. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_7 c1.

5. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_7. (constraint4)

6. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_7.

7. drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_8 c1.

8. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_8. (constraint7)

9. drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_1 c1.

10. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1.

11. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

12. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1. (constraint8)

13. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1. (goal)

14. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1. (constraint1)

15. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1.

16. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

17. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1.

18. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2. (goal)

This plan has 18 steps, same as before. But maybe step1 can be merged with other steps.

But no, each action is separate.

Thus, the optimal plan likely has 18 actions. However, perhaps there's a way to reduce steps by combining some actions.

For example, after step9, t1 is at l1_1. Unload both p1 and p2 (steps10 and 11 are separate unload actions). But in reality, each unload is a separate action. So steps10 and 11 are necessary.

Thus, the answer is this 18-step plan.
