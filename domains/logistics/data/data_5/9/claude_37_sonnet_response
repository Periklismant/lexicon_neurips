Let me break down the problem:

We have a world with cities, each having multiple locations including an airport. We also have trucks, airplanes, and packages. Our goal is to create a plan to move packages to specific locations.

The available actions are:
- loadtruck: Load a package into a truck at a location.
- loadairplane: Load a package into an airplane at a location.
- unloadtruck: Unload a package from a truck at a location.
- unloadairplane: Unload a package from an airplane at a location.
- drivetruck: Drive a truck between locations in a city.
- flyairplane: Fly an airplane between airports.

Initial state:
- Cities: c1, c2
- Locations in c1: l1_1 (airport), l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5
- Locations in c2: l2_1 (airport), l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5
- Trucks: t1 at l1_2, t2 at l2_5
- Airplanes: a1 at l1_1, a2 at l2_1
- Packages: p1 at l2_1, p2 at l1_4

Goal state:
- p1 at l2_3
- p2 at l1_3

Constraints:
1. p1 must be at l2_2 at some point.
2. At some point, p1 must be at l2_5 and p2 must be in t2.
3. p1 must be at l2_5 at some point.
4. At some point, p2 must be either in a1 or at l2_4.
5. p2 must be in a2 at some point.

Now, let's start planning. I'll think through the high-level plan first and then break it down into specific actions.

For p1:
1. Starting at l2_1, need to move to l2_3 (the goal).
2. Constraints say p1 must visit l2_2 and l2_5 at some point.
3. So, we need a route for p1: l2_1 -> (somewhere) -> l2_2 -> (somewhere) -> l2_5 -> (somewhere) -> l2_3.

For p2:
1. Starting at l1_4, need to move to l1_3 (the goal).
2. Constraints say p2 must be in t2 at some point (and at that point, p1 must be at l2_5).
3. Constraints also say p2 must be in a2 at some point.
4. And p2 must be either in a1 or at l2_4 at some point.

Let's think through this more carefully:

For p1:
- Starting at l2_1 (an airport), we could load it into a truck, drive it to l2_2, l2_5, and then to l2_3 (the goal).
- Alternatively, we could load it into an airplane, fly it to l1_1, then unload, load into a truck, drive it somewhere, load back into an airplane, fly back to l2_1, etc. But this seems unnecessary for p1 since all locations we need to visit (l2_1, l2_2, l2_5, l2_3) are in the same city (c2).

For p2:
- Starting at l1_4, we could load it into a truck, drive it to l1_3 (the goal).
- But constraints say p2 must be in a2 at some point, and a2 starts at l2_1.
- Also, p2 must be in t2 at some point (which starts at l2_5).
- And p2 must be either in a1 or at l2_4 at some point.

This is a bit more complex. We might need to:
1. Load p2 into a truck (t1, which is at l1_2, so we need to drive t1 to l1_4 first).
2. Drive to l1_1 (airport).
3. Load p2 into a1 (to satisfy one of the constraints).
4. Fly a1 to l2_1 (airport in c2).
5. Unload p2 from a1.
6. Load p2 into a2 (to satisfy another constraint).
7. Fly a2 back to l1_1.
8. Unload p2 from a2.
9. Load p2 into a truck.
10. Drive to l1_3 (goal).

But wait, we also have the constraint that p2 must be in t2 at some point, and at the same time, p1 must be at l2_5. This means we might need to coordinate the movements of both packages.

Let's approach this systematically:

1. First, let's handle p1:
   - Starting at l2_1 (an airport), we need to get it to l2_3.
   - We also need to visit l2_2 and l2_5 at some point.
   - One route could be: l2_1 -> l2_2 -> l2_5 -> l2_3.

2. Next, for p2:
   - Starting at l1_4, we need to get it to l1_3.
   - At some point, p2 must be in t2 (which starts at l2_5) and at the same time, p1 must be at l2_5.
   - p2 must also be in a2 at some point.
   - And p2 must be either in a1 or at l2_4 at some point.

Given these constraints, here's a more coordinated plan:

For p1:
1. Load p1 into a truck in l2_1 (but there's no truck there - we'd need to move one).
2. Move p1 to l2_2 (to satisfy one constraint).
3. Move p1 to l2_5 (to satisfy another constraint and coordinate with p2 being in t2).
4. Move p1 to l2_3 (the goal).

For p2:
1. Move p2 to an airport (l1_1) by truck.
2. Load p2 into a1 (to satisfy the constraint of p2 being in a1 or at l2_4).
3. Fly a1 to l2_1.
4. Unload p2 from a1.
5. Load p2 into a2 (to satisfy the constraint of p2 being in a2).
6. Fly a2 to l2_5 (so we can load p2 into t2 while p1 is at l2_5).
7. Unload p2 from a2.
8. Load p2 into t2 (to satisfy the constraint of p2 being in t2 while p1 is at l2_5).
9. Drive t2 to l2_1.
10. Unload p2 from t2.
11. Load p2 into an airplane.
12. Fly the airplane to l1_1.
13. Unload p2 from the airplane.
14. Load p2 into a truck.
15. Drive the truck to l1_3 (the goal).

But there's a problem here: we need to coordinate these so that p1 is at l2_5 exactly when p2 is in t2. Let's adjust the plan:

We need to make sure the trucks and airplanes are in the right locations. Let's track their starting locations:
- t1 is at l1_2
- t2 is at l2_5
- a1 is at l1_1
- a2 is at l2_1
- p1 is at l2_1
- p2 is at l1_4

Let's try again with a more detailed plan:

For p1:
1. Since there's no truck at l2_1 and we need to move p1 within city c2, we'll first need to move t2 from l2_5 to l2_1.
2. Load p1 into t2 at l2_1.
3. Drive t2 to l2_2 (to satisfy one constraint).
4. Drive t2 to l2_5 (to satisfy the constraint of p1 being at l2_5).

For p2:
1. First, drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_4.
2. Load p2 into t1 at l1_4.
3. Drive t1 to l1_1 (the airport in c1).
4. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1.
5. Load p2 into a1 at l1_1 (to satisfy the constraint of p2 being in a1).
6. Fly a1 to l2_1 (the airport in c2).
7. Unload p2 from a1 at l2_1.
8. Load p2 into a2 at l2_1 (to satisfy the constraint of p2 being in a2).
9. Fly a2 to l2_5.
10. At l2_5, unload p2 from a2.
11. Load p2 into t2 (which will have p1 inside, so now both p1 is at l2_5 and p2 is in t2, satisfying that constraint).

But wait, let's double-check the constraints. We need:
- p1 at l2_2 at some point
- Both p2 in t2 and p1 at l2_5 at the same time
- p1 at l2_5 at some point
- p2 either in a1 or at l2_4 at some point
- p2 in a2 at some point

Actually, let's step back. The constraint says "p1 at l2_5 and p2 in t2" at the same time. But p1 being "at" l2_5 doesn't mean it's outside the truck; it could be inside t2 which is at l2_5. So, we have two possibilities:

1. p1 is outside any vehicle at l2_5, and p2 is inside t2 (which is also at l2_5)
2. Both p1 and p2 are inside t2, which is at l2_5

I think the constraint is referring to the first case. So, let's plan accordingly.

For p1:
1. Since p1 is at l2_1 and we want to move it within city c2, we need a truck. t2 is at l2_5, so we'll move it to l2_1.
2. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1.
3. Load p1 into t2 at l2_1.
4. Drive t2 to l2_2 (to satisfy the constraint of p1 being at l2_2).
5. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_2.
6. Load p1 back into t2 at l2_2.
7. Drive t2 to l2_5 (to satisfy the constraint of p1 being at l2_5).
8. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_5.

At this point, we have p1 at l2_5. Now we need to get p2 into t2.

For p2:
1. First, drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_4.
2. Load p2 into t1 at l1_4.
3. Drive t1 to l1_1 (the airport in c1).
4. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1.
5. Load p2 into a1 at l1_1 (to satisfy the constraint of p2 being in a1).
6. Fly a1 to l2_1 (the airport in c2).
7. Unload p2 from a1 at l2_1.
8. Load p2 into a2 at l2_1 (to satisfy the constraint of p2 being in a2).
9. Fly a2 to l2_5.
10. Unload p2 from a2 at l2_5.
11. Load p2 into t2 at l2_5 (now we have p2 in t2 and p1 at l2_5, satisfying that constraint).

Wait, I realize I'm overlooking a potential issue again. The constraint says "p1 at l2_5 and p2 in t2" at the same time. We know both of them will be at l2_5, but I'm not sure if being "at" means outside a vehicle. Anyway, I'm going with both interpretations that "Package p1 is in location l2_5" means p1 is physically at l2_5, which means it's either inside a vehicle at l2_5 or outside any vehicle at l2_5.

This is getting complex. Let's approach it differently. Let me look at the constraints one by one:

1. "Package p1 is in location l2_2" at some point: This means p1 should be at l2_2 (either inside a vehicle at l2_2 or outside any vehicle at l2_2) at some point in our plan.
2. "Both p2 in t2 and p1 at l2_5" at the same time: This means at the same time point in our plan, p2 should be inside t2 and p1 should be at l2_5 (either inside a vehicle at l2_5 or outside any vehicle at l2_5).
3. "Package p1 is in location l2_5" at some point: This means p1 should be at l2_5 (either inside a vehicle at l2_5 or outside any vehicle at l2_5) at some point in our plan.
4. "Either p2 in a1 or p2 at l2_4" at some point: This means at some point in our plan, either p2 should be inside a1 or p2 should be at l2_4 (either inside a vehicle at l2_4 or outside any vehicle at l2_4).
5. "Package p2 is in a2" at some point: This means p2 should be inside a2 at some point in our plan.

Given these constraints and the current locations of everything, I need to make a comprehensive plan for both p1 and p2.

Let me rethink this from scratch:

For p1:
- Starting at l2_1 (an airport), our goal is to move it to l2_3.
- We need it to be at l2_2 at some point.
- We need it to be at l2_5 at some point, and at that point, p2 should be in t2.

For p2:
- Starting at l1_4, our goal is to move it to l1_3.
- We need it to be either in a1 or at l2_4 at some point.
- We need it to be in a2 at some point.
- We need it to be in t2 at some point, and at that point, p1 should be at l2_5.

Given that there are two cities, c1 and c2, and airplanes can only travel between airports, we'll need to think about the inter-city transportation.

I'm seeing a potential issue with the second constraint. For p2 to be in t2, t2 must be loaded with p2. But for this, p2 and t2 need to be at the same location. Initially, p2 is at l1_4 (in city c1) and t2 is at l2_5 (in city c2). This means we need to move p2 from city c1 to city c2, which requires an airplane (as trucks can only move within a city). But for this, we need to get p2 to l1_1 (the airport in c1), fly it to l2_1 (the airport in c2), and then get it to l2_5. 

Alright, I'm going to outline a comprehensive plan:

1. First, get p1 to l2_3 (the goal for p1):
   - p1 is at l2_1, which is in city c2.
   - To move p1 within city c2, we need a truck. t2 is in city c2 at location l2_5.
   - Move t2 from l2_5 to l2_1.
   - Load p1 into t2 at l2_1.
   - Drive t2 to l2_2 (to satisfy constraint 1).
   - Drive t2 to l2_5 (to satisfy constraint 3).
   - Unload p1 from t2 at l2_5 (now p1 is outside any vehicle at l2_5).

   At this point, p1 is at l2_5, and we need p2 to be in t2 at the same time (constraint 2). But p2 is currently at l1_4 in city c1, so we'll have to postpone completing the plan for p1 until we get p2 to t2 at l2_5.

2. Now, get p2 to l2_5 and loaded into t2:
   - p2 is at l1_4, which is in city c1.
   - To move p2 within city c1, we need a truck. t1 is in city c1 at location l1_2.
   - Move t1 from l1_2 to l1_4.
   - Load p2 into t1 at l1_4.
   - Drive t1 to l1_1 (the airport in c1).
   - Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1.
   - Load p2 into a1 at l1_1 (to satisfy one part of constraint 4).
   - Fly a1 to l2_1 (the airport in c2).
   - Unload p2 from a1 at l2_1.
   - Load p2 into a2 at l2_1 (to satisfy constraint 5).
   - Fly a2 to l2_5.
   - Unload p2 from a2 at l2_5.
   - Load p2 into t2 at l2_5 (now p2 is in t2 and p1 is at l2_5, satisfying constraint 2).

3. Continuing with p1:
   - Load p1 back into t2 at l2_5 (now both p1 and p2 are in t2).
   - Drive t2 to l2_3.
   - Unload p1 from t2 at l2_3 (now p1 is at its goal location).

4. Continuing with p2:
   - But we still need to get p2 to its goal location l1_3, which is in city c1. We need to:
   - Drive t2 to l2_1 (the airport in c2).
   - Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1.
   - Load p2 into one of the airplanes (let's say a1) at l2_1.
   - Fly a1 to l1_1 (the airport in c1).
   - Unload p2 from a1 at l1_1.
   - We need a truck to move p2 within city c1. t1 should be at l1_1 now.
   - Load p2 into t1 at l1_1.
   - Drive t1 to l1_3.
   - Unload p2 from t1 at l1_3 (now p2 is at its goal location).

Actually, the above plan does not satisfy the "Either p2 in a1 or p2 at l2_4" constraint. We can fix this by adding a detour for p2:

2a. After unloading p2 from a1 at l2_1, drive t2 to l2_4 with p2 in it (to satisfy the other part of constraint 4).
2b. Then drive t2 back to l2_1.

But I realize I'm making things overly complicated. Let's back up and simplify.

The constraints are:
1. "Package p1 is in location l2_2" at some point
2. "Both p2 in t2 and p1 at l2_5" at the same time
3. "Package p1 is in location l2_5" at some point
4. "Either p2 in a1 or p2 at l2_4" at some point
5. "Package p2 is in a2" at some point

And the goals are:
- p1 at l2_3
- p2 at l1_3

I'm going to approach this step by step. I'm not optimizing for the shortest plan, just making sure every constraint and goal is met.

First, let's handle p1:
1. p1 is at l2_1, and we want to get it to l2_3 via l2_2 and l2_5.
2. We need a truck in city c2, which is t2 at l2_5.
3. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1.
4. Load p1 into t2 at l2_1.
5. Drive t2 to l2_2 (to satisfy constraint 1).
6. Drive t2 to l2_5 (to satisfy constraint 3).
7. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_5 (now p1 is at l2_5, outside any vehicle).

Now, for p2, we need to get it into t2 while p1 is at l2_5:
8. p2 is at l1_4, and we want to get it to t2 at l2_5.
9. We need a truck in city c1, which is t1 at l1_2.
10. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_4.
11. Load p2 into t1 at l1_4.
12. Drive t1 to l1_1 (the airport in c1).
13. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1.
14. Load p2 into a1 at l1_1 (to satisfy one part of constraint 4).
15. Fly a1 to l2_1 (the airport in c2).
16. Unload p2 from a1 at l2_1.
17. Load p2 into a2 at l2_1 (to satisfy constraint 5).
18. Fly a2 to l2_5.
19. Unload p2 from a2 at l2_5.
20. Load p2 into t2 at l2_5 (now p2 is in t2 and p1 is at l2_5, satisfying constraint 2).

Now, let's complete the journey for p1:
21. Load p1 back into t2 at l2_5 (now both p1 and p2 are in t2).
22. Drive t2 to l2_3.
23. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_3 (now p1 is at its goal location).

Finally, let's get p2 to its goal:
24. Drive t2 to l2_1 (the airport in c2).
25. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1.
26. Load p2 into a1 at l2_1.
27. Fly a1 to l1_1 (the airport in c1).
28. Unload p2 from a1 at l1_1.
29. We need a truck to move p2 within city c1. t1 should be at l1_1 now.
30. Load p2 into t1 at l1_1.
31. Drive t1 to l1_3.
32. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_3 (now p2 is at its goal location).

Actually, I don't believe I satisfied the "either p2 in a1 or p2 at l2_4" constraint fully. We did have p2 in a1, so that part is covered. But we didn't detail that in the plan specifically, so let me revisit that.

Looking back at the initial state, I see I misunderstood something: the initial state says "Package t1 is in location l1_2" and "Package t2 is in location l2_5". It should be "Truck t1 is in location l1_2" and "Truck t2 is in location l2_5".

Additionally, I also misunderstood "Package a1 is in location l1_1" and "Package a2 is in location l2_1". It should be "Airplane a1 is in location l1_1" and "Airplane a2 is in location l2_1".

With these clarifications, I need to revise my plan. Let's make sure I've got the correct initial state:

- Cities: c1, c2
- Locations in c1: l1_1 (airport), l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5
- Locations in c2: l2_1 (airport), l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5
- Trucks: t1 at l1_2, t2 at l2_5
- Airplanes: a1 at l1_1, a2 at l2_1
- Packages: p1 at l2_1, p2 at l1_4

Let's replan:

For p1:
1. p1 is at l2_1, and we need to move it to l2_3 (the goal).
2. We also need it to be at l2_2 and l2_5 at some point.
3. We need a truck to move p1 within city c2. t2 is at l2_5.
4. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1.
5. Load p1 into t2 at l2_1.
6. Drive t2 to l2_2 (to satisfy constraint 1).
7. Drive t2 to l2_5 (to satisfy constraint 3).
8. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_5 (now p1 is at l2_5, outside any vehicle).

For p2:
9. p2 is at l1_4, and we need to move it to l1_3 (the goal).
10. We also need it to be in a2 at some point, and either in a1 or at l2_4 at another point.
11. And we need it to be in t2 at some point, while p1 is at l2_5.
12. We need a truck to move p2 within city c1. t1 is at l1_2.
13. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_4.
14. Load p2 into t1 at l1_4.
15. Drive t1 to l1_1 (the airport in c1).
16. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1.
17. Load p2 into a1 at l1_1 (to satisfy one part of constraint 4).
18. Fly a1 to l2_1 (the airport in c2).
19. Unload p2 from a1 at l2_1.
20. Load p2 into a2 at l2_1 (to satisfy constraint 5).
21. Fly a2 to l2_5.
22. Unload p2 from a2 at l2_5.
23. Load p2 into t2 at l2_5 (now p2 is in t2 and p1 is at l2_5, satisfying constraint 2).

Now, let's get p1 to its goal:
24. Load p1 back into t2 at l2_5 (now both p1 and p2 are in t2).
25. Drive t2 to l2_3.
26. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_3 (now p1 is at its goal location).

Continuing with p2, to get it to its goal:
27. Drive t2 to l2_1 (the airport in c2).
28. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1.
29. Load p2 into a1 at l2_1 (a1 should be at l2_1 now).
30. Fly a1 to l1_1 (the airport in c1).
31. Unload p2 from a1 at l1_1.
32. Load p2 into t1 at l1_1 (t1 should be at l1_1 now).
33. Drive t1 to l1_3.
34. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_3 (now p2 is at its goal location).

But I realize I haven't satisfied the "either p2 in a1 or p2 at l2_4" constraint. Let's fix that by adding a detour for p2 between steps 23 and 24:

23a. Load p2 back into t2 at l2_5.
23b. Drive t2 to l2_4 (to satisfy the other part of constraint 4).
23c. Drive t2 back to l2_5.
23d. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_5.
23e. Load p2 into t2 at l2_5 (now p2 is in t2 and p1 is at l2_5, satisfying constraint 2).

I'm going to replace this detour because I think it's redundant. We already satisfy constraint 4 by having p2 in a1 (steps 17-18). So, we can skip steps 23a through 23e.

I see another issue: a1 might not be at l2_1 at step 29. Let's keep track of the location of a1:
- Initially, a1 is at l1_1.
- At step 18, we fly a1 to l2_1.
- So, at step 29, a1 should still be at l2_1, and we can load p2 into it.

It seems like the plan checks out. Let's outline it completely:

1. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1.
2. Load p1 into t2 at l2_1.
3. Drive t2 to l2_2 (to satisfy constraint 1).
4. Drive t2 to l2_5 (to satisfy constraint 3).
5. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_5 (now p1 is at l2_5, outside any vehicle).
6. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_4.
7. Load p2 into t1 at l1_4.
8. Drive t1 to l1_1 (the airport in c1).
9. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1.
10. Load p2 into a1 at l1_1 (to satisfy one part of constraint 4).
11. Fly a1 to l2_1 (the airport in c2).
12. Unload p2 from a1 at l2_1.
13. Load p2 into a2 at l2_1 (to satisfy constraint 5).
14. Fly a2 to l2_5.
15. Unload p2 from a2 at l2_5.
16. Load p2 into t2 at l2_5 (now p2 is in t2 and p1 is at l2_5, satisfying constraint 2).
17. Load p1 back into t2 at l2_5 (now both p1 and p2 are in t2).
18. Drive t2 to l2_3.
19. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_3 (now p1 is at its goal location).
20. Drive t2 to l2_1 (the airport in c2).
21. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1.
22. Load p2 into a1 at l2_1.
23. Fly a1 to l1_1 (the airport in c1).
24. Unload p2 from a1 at l1_1.
25. Load p2 into t1 at l1_1.
26. Drive t1 to l1_3.
27. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_3 (now p2 is at its goal location).

This plan accounts for all constraints and goals. To double check:
- Constraint 1: "Package p1 is in location l2_2" at some point - Satisfied in step 3.
- Constraint 2: "Both p2 in t2 and p1 at l2_5" at the same time - Satisfied in step 16.
- Constraint 3: "Package p1 is in location l2_5" at some point - Satisfied in step 5.
- Constraint 4: "Either p2 in a1 or p2 at l2_4" at some point - Satisfied in steps 10-11.
- Constraint 5: "Package p2 is in a2" at some point - Satisfied in steps 13-14.
- Goal for p1: "Package p1 is in location l2_3" - Satisfied in step 19.
- Goal for p2: "Package p2 is in location l1_3" - Satisfied in step 27.

Alright, I'm satisfied with this plan.

Let's quickly review it to make sure I'm using the correct action names from the prompt.

From the prompt, the available actions are:
- loadtruck p t l
- loadairplane p ap l
- unloadtruck p t l
- unloadairplane p ap l
- drivetruck t l_from l_to c
- flyairplane ap l_from l_to

Let me revise my plan using these specific action names:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
3. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
4. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
5. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
6. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1
7. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
8. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
9. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
10. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
11. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
12. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
13. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
14. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l2_5
15. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_5
16. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
17. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
18. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_3 c2
19. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
20. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
21. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
22. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
23. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
24. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
25. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
26. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
27. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

Now, I need to be careful about the loads. Let's double check whether our constraints on loads are right.

Constraint 2: "The following conditions are all true: "Package p2 is in t2", "Package p1 is in location l2_5"". Step 16 loads p2 into t2 and step 17 loads p1 into t2 at the same location. But constraint 2 seems to be requiring p1 to be at l2_5, not in t2. So, do we have a state where p2 is in t2 and p1 is at l2_5? 

Actually, there's an issue here. If p1 is at l2_5 (outside any vehicle) and p2 is in t2 (which is also at l2_5), this would work. But if we load p1 into t2 at l2_5, then p1 is no longer "at" l2_5, but rather "in" t2.

The constraint says:
"The following conditions are all true: "Package p2 is in t2", "Package p1 is in location l2_5""

This seems to be saying p2 should be in t2 while p1 is in location l2_5. It's not exactly clear if "in location" means outside any vehicle or just being at that location (possibly inside a vehicle). But I think it's safer to assume that "in location" means outside any vehicle.

In that case, we need to revise the plan:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
3. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
4. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
5. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
6. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1
7. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
8. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
9. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
10. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
11. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
12. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
13. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
14. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l2_5
15. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_5
16. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
At this point, p2 is in t2 and p1 is at l2_5 (outside any vehicle), satisfying constraint 2.
17. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 (to get p2 out of t2)
18. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
19. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 (now both p1 and p2 are in t2)
20. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_3 c2
21. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
22. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
23. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
24. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
25. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
26. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
27. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
28. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
29. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

Yes, but step 17 seems unnecessary. Let me reorganize this.

Actually on second thought, I realize that I'm confused about the wording of the constraint. Let me infer from context what the constraint is asking for:

"The following conditions are all true: "Package p2 is in t2", "Package p1 is in location l2_5""

If p2 is in t2, t2 must be somewhere. If p1 is in location l2_5, then it must either be inside a vehicle at l2_5 or outside any vehicle at l2_5. I think the more reasonable interpretation is that p1 is outside any vehicle at l2_5, and p2 is inside t2 which is also at l2_5. This would make both conditions true simultaneously.

Given this interpretation, after step 16 in my revised plan, we have p2 inside t2 at l2_5 and p1 outside any vehicle at l2_5. This satisfies constraint 2.

So, the updated plan should be:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
3. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
4. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
5. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
6. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1
7. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
8. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
9. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
10. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
11. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
12. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
13. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
14. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l2_5
15. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_5
16. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
At this point, p2 is in t2 and p1 is at l2_5 (outside any vehicle), satisfying constraint 2.
17. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
18. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_3 c2
19. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
20. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
21. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
22. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
23. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
24. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
25. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
26. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
27. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

Actually, I now realize that maybe "Package p1 is in location l2_5" means p1 is external from any vehicles at l2_5. I will go with this interpretation after all.

So, the plan is as follows:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
3. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
4. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
5. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
6. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1
7. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
8. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
9. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
10. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
11. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
12. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
13. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
14. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l2_5
15. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_5
16. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
17. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
18. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_3 c2
19. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
20. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
21. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
22. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
23. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
24. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
25. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
26. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
27. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

But on second thought, step 17 is inconsistent with the interpretation that "Package p1 is in location l2_5" means p1 is outside any vehicle at l2_5. If we load p1 into t2 at step 17, it's no longer outside any vehicle at l2_5.

So, I'm going to adjust the plan after step 16:

17. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_3 c2
18. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
19. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
20. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
21. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
22. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
23. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l1_1 c1
24. unloadtruck p2 t2 l1_1
25. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
26. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
27. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

But there's a problem: trucks can only move within a city, not between cities. So, at step 23, we can't drive t2 from l2_1 (in city c2) to l1_1 (in city c1).

Let's recalibrate:

17. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_3 c2
18. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
19. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
20. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
21. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
22. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
23. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
24. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
25. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
26. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

Wait, I'm still confused. Let me get this right:

At step 16, p2 is in t2 and p1 is at l2_5 (outside any vehicle). This satisfies constraint 2. But we also need to move p1 to l2_3 and p2 to l1_3, which are the goal states.

So, I'm going to redo the plan from step 17, focusing on getting p1 to l2_3 and p2 to l1_3:

17. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (now both p1 and p2 are in t2)
18. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_3 c2
19. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (now p1 is at its goal location)
20. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
21. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
22. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
23. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
24. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
25. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
26. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
27. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (now p2 is at its goal location)

This plan should satisfy all the constraints and achieve the goal states. Let's check once more:

- Constraint 1: "Package p1 is in location l2_2" at some point - Satisfied at step 3 (after we drive t2 to l2_2 with p1 inside).
- Constraint 2: "Both p2 in t2 and p1 at l2_5" at the same time - Satisfied at step 16 (after we load p2 into t2 and before we load p1).
- Constraint 3: "Package p1 is in location l2_5" at some point - Satisfied at step 5 (after we unload p1 from t2 at l2_5).
- Constraint 4: "Either p2 in a1 or p2 at l2_4" at some point - Satisfied at step 10-11 (when p2 is in a1).
- Constraint 5: "Package p2 is in a2" at some point - Satisfied at step 13-14 (when p2 is in a2).
- Goal for p1: "Package p1 is in location l2_3" - Satisfied at step 19 (after we unload p1 from t2 at l2_3).
- Goal for p2: "Package p2 is in location l1_3" - Satisfied at step 27 (after we unload p2 from t1 at l1_3).

But wait. For constraint 1, p1 doesn't just need to be in t2 as it passes through l2_2; p1 needs to be "in location l2_2". This means I want it to be outside any vehicle at l2_2. Let me adjust the plan accordingly:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
3. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (to satisfy constraint 1)
5. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
6. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
7. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (to satisfy constraint 3)
... (the rest of the plan remains the same)

Alright, the final plan (with all constraints and goals in mind) should be:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
3. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (now p1 is at l2_2, satisfying constraint 1)
5. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
6. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
7. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (now p1 is at l2_5, satisfying constraint 3)
8. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1
9. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
10. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
11. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
12. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (now p2 is in a1, partly satisfying constraint 4)
13. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
14. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
15. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (now p2 is in a2, satisfying constraint 5)
16. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l2_5
17. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_5
18. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 (now p2 is in t2 and p1 is at l2_5, satisfying constraint 2)
19. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
20. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_3 c2
21. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (now p1 is at its goal location)
22. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
23. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
24. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
25. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
26. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
27. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
28. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
29. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (now p2 is at its goal location)

Wait, I just realized there's an issue. I've been assuming "Package p1 is in location l2_2" means p1 is outside any vehicle at l2_2, and similarly for other "in location" statements. But the initial state also uses "is in location" for trucks and airplanes, which presumably are not inside other vehicles. So, "is in location" might just mean "is at the location" (inside or outside a vehicle).

To be safe, let's interpret constraint 1 ("Package p1 is in location l2_2") more broadly to mean "p1 is at l2_2" (either inside a vehicle or outside any vehicle). This means step 3 (after we drive t2 to l2_2 with p1 inside) might already satisfy constraint 1.

However, constraint 2 explicitly mentions "p2 is in t2" and "p1 is in location l2_5" together. This suggests there's a distinction between "is in" (inside a vehicle) and "is in location" (at a location, possibly outside any vehicle). So, I'm going to stick with my original interpretation that "is in location" means "is at the location and outside any vehicle".

So, the plan I outlined (with steps 1-29) is correct according to this interpretation.

Wait a second, I'm confused with the given state: "Package a1 is in location l1_1"? It should probably be "Airplane a1 is in location l1_1".

Actually, let's re-examine the initial state from the prompt:
- "Location l1_1 is in city c1"
- "Location l1_2 is in city c1"
- "Location l1_3 is in city c1"
- "Location l1_4 is in city c1"
- "Location l1_5 is in city c1"
- "Location l2_1 is in city c2"
- "Location l2_2 is in city c2"
- "Location l2_3 is in city c2"
- "Location l2_4 is in city c2"
- "Location l2_5 is in city c2"
- "Package t1 is in location l1_2"
- "Package t2 is in location l2_5"
- "Package p1 is in location l2_1"
- "Package p2 is in location l1_4"
- "Package a1 is in location l1_1"
- "Package a2 is in location l2_1"

This is clearly a typo in the prompt. t1 and t2 should be trucks, and a1 and a2 should be airplanes. So, let's assume the corrected initial state is:

- "Truck t1 is in location l1_2"
- "Truck t2 is in location l2_5"
- "Package p1 is in location l2_1"
- "Package p2 is in location l1_4"
- "Airplane a1 is in location l1_1"
- "Airplane a2 is in location l2_1"

With this correction, our plan is consistent with the initial state. Let's double-check the final plan I've outlined:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
3. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (now p1 is at l2_2, satisfying constraint 1)
5. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
6. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
7. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (now p1 is at l2_5, satisfying constraint 3)
8. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1
9. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
10. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
11. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
12. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (now p2 is in a1, partly satisfying constraint 4)
13. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
14. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
15. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (now p2 is in a2, satisfying constraint 5)
16. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l2_5
17. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_5
18. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 (now p2 is in t2 and p1 is at l2_5, satisfying constraint 2)
19. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
20. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_3 c2
21. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (now p1 is at its goal location)
22. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
23. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
24. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
25. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
26. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
27. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
28. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
29. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (now p2 is at its goal location)

This plan satisfies all the constraints and achieves the goal states, based on our interpretation.

In terms of optimality, this plan seems quite long (29 steps), but it's not straightforward to make it shorter while still satisfying all the constraints. The constraints force us to take specific paths and make specific stops, which increases the length of the plan.

For instance, we need to:
- Get p1 to l2_2 and l2_5 at specific times
- Get p2 into a1, a2, and t2 at specific times
- Coordinate the movements so that p2 is in t2 while p1 is at l2_5

I think this is a reasonable plan given the constraints. But if there's a shorter valid plan that I'm not seeing, then further optimization may be possible.

In any case, I'm satisfied with the plan I've outlined. It addresses all the requirements and constraints of the problem.

Actually, hold on. Let me double check whether p2 in a1 is still at l1_1. Let me trace through relevant parts related to a1:
- Initially, a1 is at l1_1.
- At step 12, we load p2 into a1 at l1_1 (now p2 is in a1 at l1_1).
- At step 13, we fly a1 to l2_1 (now p2 is in a1 at l2_1).

So, p2 is in a1 at steps 12-13, but a1 changes location from l1_1 to l2_1. Does constraint 4 require p2 to be in a1 at l1_1 specifically? Let's check the constraint:

Constraint 4: "At least one of the following conditions is true: "Package p2 is in a1", "Package p2 is in location l2_4""

It just requires p2 to be in a1, without specifying the location of a1. So, steps 12-13 satisfy this constraint regardless of a1's location.

This is good. The plan is consistent and should satisfy all the constraints. I'll stick with it.

Let me write the final plan once more, in the right format:
