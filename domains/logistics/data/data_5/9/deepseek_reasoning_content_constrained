Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. First, I need to understand the initial state, the goal, and the constraints. Let's break it down.

Initial State:
- Locations:
  - c1 has l1_1 (airport), l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5
  - c2 has l2_1 (airport), l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5
- Packages:
  - p1 is in l2_1 (c2's airport)
  - p2 is in l1_4 (c1)
- Trucks:
  - t1 is in l1_2 (c1)
  - t2 is in l2_5 (c2)
- Airplanes:
  - a1 is in l1_1 (c1's airport)
  - a2 is in l2_1 (c2's airport)

Goal:
- p1 must be in l2_3 (c2)
- p2 must be in l1_3 (c1)

Constraints:
1. At some state, p1 is in l2_2.
2. At some state, p2 is in t2 and p1 is in l2_5.
3. At some state, p1 is in l2_5.
4. At some state, p2 is in a1 or l2_4.
5. At some state, p2 is in a2.

Hmm, the constraints add some intermediate steps. Let's see how to satisfy each.

Starting with p1. It's in l2_1 (airport of c2). The goal is l2_3 in c2. Since trucks can move within the same city, perhaps use t2 to move p1. But first, p1 is at the airport, so maybe load it into a truck, drive to l2_3. But wait, t2 is initially in l2_5. So maybe we need to get t2 to l2_1 first? Wait, can a truck move between locations in its city. Since l2_1 is in c2, and t2 is in l2_5 (also c2), so t2 can drive to l2_1. Then load p1 into t2, drive to l2_3, unload.

But there's a constraint that p1 must be in l2_5 at some point. Wait, constraint 2 says that in some state, p2 is in t2 and p1 is in l2_5. Also, constraint 3 requires p1 to be in l2_5. So p1 must go through l2_5. That complicates things. So p1's path might need to go from l2_1 to l2_5, then to l2_3. But how?

Wait, p1 is initially at l2_1. To get to l2_5, maybe we can use t2. But t2 is at l2_5. So first, drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1. Then load p1 into t2, drive back to l2_5, unload p1 there (satisfying constraint 3). Then drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_3 and unload p1 there. But let's check the steps:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
3. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (now p1 is in l2_5, satisfying constraint 3)
5. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_3 c2
6. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

But then during step 2, when we load p1 into t2 at l2_1, that's possible. Then after step 4, p1 is in l2_5. That satisfies constraint 3. Also, during step 4, after unloading, p1 is in l2_5. Then step 5 moves t2 to l2_3 and unload. That gets p1 to l2_3. But the constraint 2 requires a state where p2 is in t2 and p1 is in l2_5. Wait, p2 is in l1_4 initially. How can p2 get into t2 (which is in c2)? Because t2 is in c2's city, so unless p2 is moved to c2, but p2 is in c1. So maybe using airplanes.

So p2 is in l1_4 (c1). Need to get it to l1_3. Let's think about p2's movement. Since l1_4 is in c1, maybe use truck t1 (which is in l1_2) to move it. So drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_4, load p2, drive to l1_3, unload. But the constraints require that p2 is in a2 at some point. Also, constraint 4 requires p2 to be in a1 or l2_4. So p2 has to be in a2 (constraint 5) and either a1 or l2_4 (constraint 4).

This suggests that p2 needs to be transported via airplane. For example, p2 might be loaded into a1 in c1, flown to c2's airport, then into a2, or something like that. But how to satisfy all constraints?

Let's outline possible steps for p2:

1. Use t1 in c1 to pick up p2 from l1_4. Drive t1 to l1_4, load p2, then drive to l1_1 (airport) to load into a1. Then fly a1 to l2_1 (c2's airport), unload into a2. But constraint 5 requires p2 to be in a2. Then maybe fly a2 somewhere else? Wait, the goal is to get p2 to l1_3 in c1. So this approach would require moving p2 from c1 to c2 and back, which might be complicated. Alternatively, perhaps use airplanes within the same city? But airplanes can only move between airports. Wait, airports are in different cities. So to move between cities, you need airplanes.

Wait, the cities have their own airports. So if a package is in c1, to get it to c2, you need to fly it via an airplane. But the goal for p2 is in c1, so maybe moving it to another city and back is not efficient. But the constraints require that p2 is in a2 (which is in c2's airport l2_1) at some point. So p2 must be moved to c2's airport, loaded into a2, then perhaps back to c1. Let's see.

Let me try to plan for p2:

- Initial location: l1_4 (c1)
- Need to get to l1_3 (c1)
- Constraints:
  - Must be in a2 (c2's airplane) at some point.
  - Must be in a1 (c1's airplane) or l2_4 (c2's location) at some point.

So possible steps:

1. Use t1 to move p2 from l1_4 to l1_1 (airport of c1).
2. Load p2 into a1 at l1_1.
3. Fly a1 to l2_1 (c2's airport).
4. Unload p2 from a1 into l2_1.
5. Load p2 into a2 at l2_1 (satisfies constraint 5: p2 is in a2).
6. Fly a2 back to l1_1? Wait, no, airplanes can only move between airports. So if a2 is in l2_1, to get p2 back to c1, we need to fly a2 to l1_1. But a2's initial location is l2_1, right? Wait, initial state says "Package a2 is in location l2_1". Wait, wait, no: the initial state lists "Package a1 is in location l1_1", "Package a2 is in location l2_1". Wait, are a1 and a2 airplanes? Yes, according to the objects list: "airplane a1", "airplane a2". So a1 is in l1_1, a2 in l2_1.

So to get p2 into a2, we need to bring p2 to l2_1. So steps for p2:

From l1_4 (c1) to l1_1 (airport) via truck t1. Then load into a1, fly a1 to l2_1. Then unload p2 into l2_1, load into a2 (constraint 5 met here). Then fly a2 somewhere? But the goal is l1_3 in c1. So to get p2 back to c1, need to fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1. But can airplanes fly between any airports? Yes. So fly a2 to l1_1, unload p2, then use truck t1 to take it to l1_3.

But this would require a lot of steps. Let's outline:

For p2:

1. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_4 (current location of p2).
2. Load p2 into t1 at l1_4.
3. Drive t1 to l1_1 (airport).
4. Unload p2 into l1_1.
5. Load p2 into a1 at l1_1.
6. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1 (c2's airport).
7. Unload p2 into l2_1.
8. Load p2 into a2 at l2_1 (satisfies constraint 5: p2 in a2).
9. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
10. Unload p2 into l1_1.
11. Load p2 into t1 (if t1 is back at l1_1) and drive to l1_3.
12. Unload p2 at l1_3.

But this is quite long. Also, need to check constraints:

- Constraint 4: p2 in a1 (step 5) or l2_4. So during step 5, p2 is loaded into a1 (satisfies the first part of constraint 4). So that's covered. Also, step 8 has p2 in a2 (constraint 5). 

But step 7 unloads p2 into l2_1, which isn't l2_4. So maybe we need an additional step where p2 is moved to l2_4. But that would complicate things. Wait, constraint 4 says "at least one of the following: p2 in a1 or l2_4". Since we already have p2 in a1 (during step 5), that's sufficient. So maybe that's okay. So step 5 satisfies constraint 4 (since p2 is in a1). Then step 8 satisfies constraint 5.

But let's check all constraints:

Constraints:

1. p1 in l2_2 at some state.
2. p2 in t2 and p1 in l2_5 at some state.
3. p1 in l2_5 at some state.
4. p2 in a1 or l2_4.
5. p2 in a2.

So for constraint 2, we need a state where p2 is in t2 (which is in c2) and p1 is in l2_5. How to achieve that.

But currently, in the initial plan for p1, we have p1 in l2_5 at step 4 (after unloading). So during that time, where is p2? If p2 is in t2, that's needed. But how to get p2 into t2.

t2 is in c2. So p2 would have to be in c2 to be loaded into t2. Let's see. If during the steps for p2, after being flown to l2_1 (step 7), we load p2 into t2 (which is in l2_5 after step 3?), but wait, t2's movement.

Wait, let's re-examine the plan for p1. For p1, earlier steps were:

1. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1.
2. Load p1 into t2 at l2_1.
3. Drive t2 to l2_5, unload p1 (now p1 is in l2_5, satisfying constraint 3).
4. Then drive t2 to l2_3 and unload.

But during step 3, after loading p1 into t2, t2 is driven to l2_5. So during that time, p1 is in t2. When unloaded at l2_5, p1 is there. Now, during the steps for p2, after step 7, p2 is in l2_1. To get p2 into t2, we need t2 to be in l2_1. But t2 is moving from l2_5 to l2_1 (step 1 for p1's plan), then back to l2_5 (step3). So during the time when t2 is at l2_1, after step1, p2 is not yet in l2_1. Because p2 is in a1, then flown to l2_1 (step6-7). So timing-wise, perhaps we need to synchronize these steps.

Alternatively, maybe adjust the order. Let's try to merge both plans.

Possible combined plan:

First, handle p1's movement to l2_5, which satisfies constraint3, and also allows for constraint2 (p2 in t2 and p1 in l2_5). But how to get p2 into t2.

Wait, to have p2 in t2 (which is in c2), p2 must be in a location in c2. So p2 must be transported to c2. Let's think:

For p2:

- Take p2 from l1_4 (c1) to l1_1 via t1.
- Load into a1, fly to l2_1 (c2's airport).
- Unload p2 into l2_1.
- Load p2 into t2 (which is in l2_1 after step1 of p1's plan) and then drive t2 to l2_5.

Wait, let's see:

Steps for p1:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 (so t2 is now in l2_1)
   - Now, t2 is in l2_1.

Steps for p2:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1 (to pick up p2)
2. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
3. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
4. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (p2 now at l1_1)
5. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (a1 is here)
6. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (p2 is now in l2_1)
7. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (p2 at l2_1)
8. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (t2 is here after step1)
   - Now, p2 is in t2, which is in l2_1. Then drive t2 to l2_5.
9. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
10. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 (p2 in l2_5)
   - But how does this help? We need to have p2 in t2 and p1 in l2_5 at the same time.

So during step10, p2 is unloaded into l2_5, but p1 is loaded into t2 and driven to l2_5 in p1's plan. Wait, perhaps adjust the order.

Let's reorganize:

For p1:

1. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (c2).
2. Load p1 into t2 at l2_1.
3. Drive t2 back to l2_5, unload p1 (now p1 is in l2_5, satisfying constraint3).
   - At this point, t2 is in l2_5 with p1 unloaded.

For p2:

1. Use t1 to move p2 to l1_1, load into a1, fly to l2_1.
2. At l2_1, unload p2 and load into t2 (which is in l2_1 after step1 of p1's plan).
3. Drive t2 to l2_5, now p2 is in t2 (so when t2 arrives at l2_5, p2 is in t2, but after unloading p1, perhaps before loading p2?)

Wait, this is getting complex. Let's try to outline the steps in order:

1. (p1) drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 (t2 arrives at l2_1)
2. (p1) loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (p1 is in t2)
3. (p1) drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2 (t2 arrives at l2_5 with p1)
4. (p1) unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (p1 is now in l2_5, satisfying constraint3)
   - At this point, t2 is in l2_5 with no packages.

Now, for p2 to be in t2 at some point, we need to have p2 loaded into t2 while t2 is in some location. Let's see:

For p2:

5. (p2) drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1
6. (p2) loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
7. (p2) drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
8. (p2) unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (p2 in l1_1)
9. (p2) loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
10. (p2) flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
11. (p2) unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (p2 in l2_1)
12. (p2) loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (t2 is now back in l2_1? No, after step3, t2 is in l2_5.)

Wait, no. After step3 (drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5), t2 is in l2_5. So step12 can't happen unless t2 is driven back to l2_1 again. Which would add more steps. But this is getting complicated. Let's think of another approach.

Maybe after p1 is unloaded in l2_5 (step4), t2 is in l2_5. Then, to load p2 into t2, p2 needs to be in l2_5. But how? Because p2 is in l2_1 after step11. So maybe drive t2 back to l2_1 again. But that's more steps.

Alternatively, maybe after p2 is in l2_1 (step11), use a different truck or airplane to move it to l2_5. But the only truck in c2 is t2, which is in l2_5 after step4. So to get p2 into t2, we need to bring t2 to l2_1 again. Let's try:

After step4 (p1 unloaded in l2_5), t2 is in l2_5.

13. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 (t2 returns to l2_1)
14. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (p2 is here from step11)
15. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2 (now p2 is in t2, arriving at l2_5)
16. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 (p2 is in l2_5)

But now, during step15, when t2 is driving from l2_1 to l2_5 with p2 inside, there's a state where p2 is in t2 and p1 is in l2_5 (since p1 was unloaded in step4). So that would satisfy constraint2: "Package p2 is in t2" and "Package p1 is in l2_5". So steps 15 and 4 would overlap in time. Wait, no, steps are sequential. So after step4, p1 is in l2_5. Then steps13-15 happen, and during step15, p2 is in t2 (loaded in step14) while p1 is in l2_5. So that's a state where both conditions hold. So that satisfies constraint2.

But then, after step16, p2 is in l2_5, but how to get it to l1_3. Also, constraint5 requires p2 to be in a2. So we need to get p2 into a2 at some point.

Wait, step16 leaves p2 in l2_5. From there, how to get it into a2. a2 is in l2_1. So need to load p2 into t2, drive to l2_1, load into a2.

17. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 (p2 is now in t2)
18. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
19. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (p2 in l2_1)
20. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (satisfies constraint5)
21. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (to get back to c1)
22. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
23. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (assuming t1 is back at l1_1)
24. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
25. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (goal achieved)

But this is getting extremely long. Also, we need to check if t1 is available. Let's track t1's movements:

t1 starts at l1_2.

Steps5-7: t1 goes to l1_4, loads p2, drives to l1_1, unloads p2. So after step8, t1 is at l1_1. Then step23 would require t1 to be at l1_1 again. So that's possible. So steps5-8, then steps23-25.

But this is making the plan very lengthy, and the problem requires an optimal (shortest) plan. So perhaps there's a smarter way.

Alternative approach for p2: 

Use a1 to fly p2 to l2_1, then load into a2 (satisfy constraint5), then fly a2 back to l1_1, then use t1 to drive to l1_3. But also need to satisfy constraint4 (p2 in a1 or l2_4). Loading into a1 would satisfy that.

So steps for p2:

1. t1 drives to l1_4, picks up p2, drives to l1_1.
2. Load p2 into a1 (satisfies constraint4).
3. Fly a1 to l2_1.
4. Unload p2 into l2_1.
5. Load p2 into a2 (satisfies constraint5).
6. Fly a2 to l1_1.
7. Unload p2 into l1_1.
8. Load p2 into t1 (if t1 is at l1_1).
9. Drive t1 to l1_3, unload.

But this requires t1 to be available. Let's check t1's movements:

Steps for p2:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1
2. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
3. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
4. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
5. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (constraint4 met)
6. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
7. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
8. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (constraint5 met)
9. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
10. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
11. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (assuming t1 is still at l1_1 from step3)
12. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
13. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (goal achieved)

So that's 13 steps for p2. For p1:

Need to get p1 from l2_1 to l2_3, but with constraints:

- p1 must be in l2_2, l2_5.

Wait, initial state says p1 is in l2_1. So to get to l2_3, can we move it via truck. But the truck t2 is initially in l2_5. So steps:

For p1:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 (to pick up p1)
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
3. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2 (this would place p1 in l2_2, satisfying constraint1)
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (now p1 is in l2_2)
5. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (but why? Wait, need to get p1 to l2_5. So perhaps after step3, drive to l2_5 instead. Let me think.)

Wait, constraint1 requires p1 to be in l2_2 at some point. So we need to have p1 there.

So:

1. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1.
2. Load p1 into t2 at l2_1.
3. Drive t2 to l2_2, unload p1 (now p1 is in l2_2, satisfying constraint1).
4. Load p1 back into t2, drive to l2_5, unload (satisfies constraint3).
5. Then drive to l2_3 and unload.

But that adds steps. Let's outline:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
3. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2 (p1 in t2 at l2_2)
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (p1 now here, constraint1 met)
5. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
6. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
7. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (constraint3 met)
8. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_3 c2
9. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (goal met)

So this is 9 steps for p1. Combined with p2's steps, it's a lot. But the problem requires an optimal plan. Maybe there's a way to overlap steps.

Wait, let's see if some steps can be merged. For example, when p2 is in a2 (step8 in p2's plan), that's also when p1 is being moved. But how to interleave.

Alternatively, maybe find a way to have p1's path go through l2_2 and l2_5, and p2's path through a2 and a1, while meeting the constraints.

But this is getting very complex. Let's try to outline the entire plan step by step, ensuring all constraints are met.

Final Plan Outline:

For p1 (c2):
- Start in l2_1.
- Need to go to l2_3, passing through l2_2 and l2_5.

For p2 (c1):
- Start in l1_4.
- Need to go to l1_3, passing through a1, a2, and meet constraints.

Combined steps:

1. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_4 (c1). [p2's step1]
2. Load p2 into t1. [p2's step2]
3. Drive t1 to l1_1. [p2's step3]
4. Unload p2 into l1_1. [p2's step4]
5. Load p2 into a1. [p2's step5] (constraint4 met)
6. Fly a1 to l2_1. [p2's step6]
7. Unload p2 into l2_1. [p2's step7]
8. Load p2 into a2. [p2's step8] (constraint5 met)
9. Fly a2 to l1_1. [p2's step9]
10. Unload p2 into l1_1. [p2's step10]
11. Load p2 into t1 (assuming t1 is still at l1_1). [p2's step11]
12. Drive t1 to l1_3. [p2's step12]
13. Unload p2 into l1_3. [p2's step13]

For p1:

14. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1. [p1's step1]
15. Load p1 into t2. [p1's step2]
16. Drive t2 to l2_2. [p1's step3]
17. Unload p1 into l2_2. [p1's step4] (constraint1 met)
18. Load p1 into t2. [p1's step5]
19. Drive t2 to l2_5. [p1's step6]
20. Unload p1 into l2_5. [p1's step7] (constraint3 met)
21. Drive t2 to l2_3. [p1's step8]
22. Unload p1 into l2_3. [p1's step9]

But this is 22 steps, which is very long. However, we need to check if during any of these steps the constraints are met. For example, constraint2 requires that p2 is in t2 and p1 is in l2_5. When is p2 in t2?

Looking at the steps, p2 is in a2 (step8), then in l1_1 (step10), then in t1 (step11). There's no step where p2 is in t2. So this plan does not satisfy constraint2. So this approach is invalid.

Hmm. So, to meet constraint2, we need a state where p2 is in t2 (c2's truck) and p1 is in l2_5. To get p2 into t2, p2 must be in c2, so steps must include moving p2 to c2 and into t2. But in the current plan, p2 is in a2 (step8), which is in l2_1. So perhaps after step7, when p2 is in l2_1, we can load it into t2 (which is in l2_1 after step14). Let's adjust:

Let me reorder steps to interleave p1 and p2's actions:

1. (p1) drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
2. (p2) drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1
3. (p2) loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
4. (p2) drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
5. (p2) unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
6. (p2) loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (constraint4)
7. (p2) flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
8. (p2) unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
9. (p2) loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (now p2 is in t2, which is in l2_1)
10. (p1) loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (now t2 has both p1 and p2? No, each load action is per package.)

Wait, no. Each load action is for a single package. So step9 loads p2 into t2, then step10 loads p1 into t2. So t2 now has both packages. Then drive t2 to l2_5:

11. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
12. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (now p1 is here, satisfying constraint3)
13. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 (now p2 is here)

At this point, during step12 and 13, after unloading, p1 is in l2_5 (constraint3), and p2 is in l2_5. But how does this help with constraint2, which requires p2 to be in t2 and p1 in l2_5 at the same time. That occurs during step11, when t2 is driving from l2_1 to l2_5 with both packages. So during that action, the state before unloading is when both are in t2 and the location is l2_5. Wait, no. The drivetruck action's effect is that the truck is now in l2_5. So during the action drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2, the truck moves, and after that, the truck is in l2_5. So before unloading, both packages are in t2 at l2_5. So during step12 and 13, when unloading p1 and p2, the state after step11 has both in t2 at l2_5. So step12: unload p1, now p1 is in l2_5, and p2 is still in t2. So during step12, after unloading p1, p1 is in l2_5 and p2 is in t2. That satisfies constraint2. So step12 is when constraint2 is met.

Then step13 unloads p2 into l2_5. Now, need to get p1 to l2_3 and p2 to l1_3.

Continue:

14. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_3 c2 (move p1's location from l2_5 to l2_3)
15. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (but p1 was already unloaded in step12. Wait, no. In step12, p1 is unloaded into l2_5. Then in step14, t2 is driven to l2_3, but p1 is already in l2_5. So this approach is incorrect. Because after step12, p1 is in l2_5, and t2 is in l2_5 with p2. So step13 unloads p2. Then t2 is empty. So to get p1 to l2_3, we need to load it back into t2.

But p1 is in l2_5. So steps would be:

14. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (but p1 is in l2_5, t2 is in l2_5)
15. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_3 c2
16. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (goal met for p1)

For p2, after step13, p2 is in l2_5. Need to get it to l1_3. How? Since l2_5 is in c2, need to use airplane.

17. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 (t2 is here)
18. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 (drive to airport)
19. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
20. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (constraint5 again)
21. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
22. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
23. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (t1 is here from step4)
24. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
25. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (goal met)

This seems to cover all constraints, but it's very long. Let's count the steps:

Steps 1-25. But maybe some steps can be optimized.

Let's check constraints:

- constraint1: p1 in l2_2. But in this plan, p1 is loaded into t2 and driven to l2_5, then to l2_3. So constraint1 isn't met. Wait, I missed that. The plan must have a state where p1 is in l2_2. So we need to adjust.

So, to meet constraint1, p1 must pass through l2_2. Let's adjust p1's route:

After step10 (p1 loaded into t2 at l2_1), drive t2 to l2_2 first.

Revised steps:

11. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2 (now p1 is in t2 at l2_2)
12. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (constraint1 met)
13. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
14. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
15. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (constraint3 met)
16. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 (now p2 is in l2_5)
17. Now, p1 is in l2_5. To get to l2_3:
17. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
18. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_3 c2
19. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

But this adds more steps. Also, during step11-15, p2 is in t2. After step14, t2 is in l2_5 with both packages. When unloaded, p1 and p2 are both in l2_5. But step16 unloads p2, but how? Because after step15, p1 is unloaded, but p2 was loaded into t2 at step9. So during steps11-14, t2 is moving from l2_1 to l2_2 to l2_5, carrying both p1 and p2? Wait, no. Each load action is for a single package. So when step9 loads p2 into t2, and step10 loads p1 into t2, then t2 has both packages. Then driving to l2_2, unloading p1 (step12), then driving to l2_5, unloading p2 (step15). But then step15 would unload p2 from t2, which is in l2_5. So during step15, p2 is unloaded into l2_5. 

But this requires that both packages are in t2. However, the load actions are separate. So after step9, p2 is in t2. Then step10 loads p1 into t2. So yes, t2 has both. Then during step12, unload p1 into l2_2. Now, p1 is in l2_2 (constraint1 met), p2 is still in t2. Then step13 loads p1 back into t2. Then drive to l2_5. Then unload p1 (step15) and p2 (step16). 

This is getting very complicated, but let's proceed.

Now, checking constraint2: must have p2 in t2 and p1 in l2_5. After step15, p1 is in l2_5. At that point, p2 is still in t2 (because step15 unloads p1, not p2). So after step15, t2 is in l2_5, p2 is in t2. So during this state, p1 is in l2_5 and p2 is in t2. That satisfies constraint2. Then step16 unloads p2 into l2_5.

So far, constraints1,2,3 are met. For constraint4, p2 was in a1 (step6), which satisfies the condition. Constraint5 is met in step20 (loading into a2).

This plan now includes steps to meet all constraints but is quite long. Let's count the steps again:

1. t2 to l2_1
2. t1 to l1_4
3. load p2 into t1
4. t1 to l1_1
5. unload p2 into l1_1
6. load p2 into a1 (constraint4)
7. fly a1 to l2_1
8. unload p2 into l2_1
9. load p2 into t2
10. load p1 into t2
11. drive t2 to l2_2
12. unload p1 (constraint1)
13. load p1 into t2
14. drive t2 to l2_5
15. unload p1 (constraint3)
16. unload p2 (now p2 is in l2_5)
17. load p1 into t2
18. drive t2 to l2_3
19. unload p1 (goal)
20. load p2 into t2 (from l2_5)
21. drive t2 to l2_1
22. unload p2 into l2_1
23. load p2 into a2 (constraint5)
24. fly a2 to l1_1
25. unload p2 into l1_1
26. load p2 into t1
27. drive t1 to l1_3
28. unload p2 (goal)

This is 28 steps, which is way too long. There must be a shorter way.

Alternative Idea:

For p1, after being unloaded in l2_5 (constraint3), drive t2 to l2_3 and unload. But to meet constraint1 (p1 in l2_2), perhaps have t2 drive through l2_2.

For p1:

1. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1.
2. Load p1.
3. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2. (constraint1)
4. Unload p1.
5. Load p1.
6. Drive to l2_5. (unload here for constraint3)
7. Drive to l2_3. Unload.

This is 7 steps for p1.

For p2:

Use airplane a2 to fly p2 from l1_1 to l2_1, load into a2 (constraint5), then fly back to l1_1, and drive to l1_3. Also, during the flight, satisfy constraint4 by having p2 in a1.

But this might not work. Let's see:

For p2:

1. Drive t1 to l1_4, load p2, drive to l1_1.
2. Unload p2.
3. Load into a1 (constraint4).
4. Fly a1 to l2_1.
5. Unload p2.
6. Load into a2 (constraint5).
7. Fly a2 to l1_1.
8. Unload p2.
9. Load into t1.
10. Drive to l1_3, unload.

This is 10 steps for p2.

But also need to satisfy constraint2: p2 in t2 and p1 in l2_5. So during p2's steps, after step5 (p2 in l2_1), load into t2 (which is in l2_1 after step1 of p1's plan). So:

In p1's step1, t2 is driven to l2_1.

In p2's steps:

After step5, p2 is in l2_1. Load into t2 (which is in l2_1 from p1's step1). Then drive t2 to l2_5, unload p1 and p2.

Let's integrate:

For p1:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
3. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2 (constraint1)
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
5. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
6. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
7. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (constraint3)
8. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_3 c2
9. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (goal)

For p2:

10. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1
11. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
12. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
13. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
14. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (constraint4)
15. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
16. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
17. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (t2 is here from p1's step1)
18. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2 (now p2 is in t2, and during this drive, p1 is unloaded in step7. So when t2 arrives at l2_5, p1 is already in l2_5. But during the drive, p1 is in t2 (since step5 loaded p1 into t2, and step6 drove to l2_5, then step7 unloads p1). So during step18, t2 is moving from l2_1 to l2_5 with p2 loaded, and p1 is also in t2 (from step5). Wait, no. Steps are sequential. After step6, t2 is in l2_5, and step7 unloads p1. Then step8 drives to l2_3. So how can p2 be loaded into t2 in step17 if t2 is in l2_5?

This is where timing is crucial. Let's re-express the steps in order:

1. p1: t2 drives to l2_1.
2. p1: load p1 into t2.
3. p1: drive t2 to l2_2, unload p1 (constraint1).
4. p1: load p1 back, drive to l2_5, unload (constraint3).
5. p1: drive to l2_3, unload (goal).

Meanwhile, p2:

6. t1 drives to l1_4, picks up p2, drives to l1_1.
7. unload p2, load into a1, fly to l2_1.
8. unload p2, load into t2 (which is now in l2_1 after p1's step1).
   - But after p1's step1, t2 is in l2_1. But after step3 of p1's plan, t2 is in l2_2. So timing is conflicting.

This indicates that the steps for p1 and p2 need to be interleaved correctly. Let's try:

1. p1: drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
2. p2: drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1
3. p2: loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
4. p2: drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
5. p2: unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
6. p2: loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (constraint4)
7. p2: flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
8. p2: unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
9. p2: loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (t2 is here from step1)
10. p1: loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (now t2 has p1 and p2)
11. p1: drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2 (constraint1)
12. p1: unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
13. p1: loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
14. p1: drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
15. p1: unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (constraint3)
16. p2: unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 (now p2 is in l2_5)
17. p1: drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_3 c2
18. p1: unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (goal)
19. p2: loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
20. p2: drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
21. p2: unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
22. p2: loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (constraint5)
23. p2: flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
24. p2: unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
25. p2: loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
26. p2: drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
27. p2: unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (goal)

This plan has 27 steps, but let's check constraints:

- constraint1: step12, p1 in l2_2.
- constraint2: during step14-15, after driving to l2_5, p1 is unloaded, but p2 is still in t2. So during step15, after unloading p1, p1 is in l2_5 and p2 is in t2. This satisfies constraint2.
- constraint3: step15, p1 in l2_5.
- constraint4: step6, p2 in a1.
- constraint5: step22, p2 in a2.

This plan meets all constraints but is quite long. However, the problem requires an optimal (shortest) plan. So perhaps there's a shorter way.

Alternative Idea: Use airplanes more effectively. For p2, instead of moving back to c1 via a2, maybe use another truck or airplane.

But time is limited, and perhaps this is the best possible given the constraints. I'll proceed to outline the steps in the required format.
