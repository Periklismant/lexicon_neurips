Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. Hmm, the goal is to get p1 to l1_6 and p2 to l1_3. But there are a bunch of constraints to satisfy. Let me start by understanding the initial state and the constraints.

First, initial locations:
- p1 is in l2_5 (city c2)
- p2 is in l1_6 (city c1)
- Trucks t1 is in l1_8 (c1), t2 in l2_3 (c2)
- Airplanes a1 in l1_1 (c1's airport), a2 in l2_1 (c2's airport)

So, p1 needs to go from c2 to c1. Since airplanes can move between airports, maybe use a2 to fly p1 from c2 to c1's airport. Then use a truck to move it to l1_6. But wait, the goal is l1_6 for p1. Wait, no, the goal is p1 in l1_6 and p2 in l1_3. Wait, p2 is already in l1_6. Oh, no, p2 is in l1_6 initially. Wait, the goal is p2 in l1_3. So p2 needs to move from l1_6 to l1_3 in c1. Since both are in c1, maybe use truck t1 (which is in l1_8). But t1 is in l1_8. So need to drive t1 to l1_6 to pick up p2, then drive to l1_3.

But wait, for p1, which is in c2, we need to get it to c1. So maybe load p1 onto a truck in c2 (t2 is in l2_3), drive t2 to l2_5 to pick up p1. Then drive to l2_1 (airport), load onto a2, fly to l1_1, unload into a1? Wait, no. Wait, airplanes can carry packages. So load p1 onto a2 at l2_1, then fly a2 to l1_1 (c1's airport). Then unload p1 into a1? Or unload directly into a truck. Wait, after flying, a2 is at l1_1. Then maybe use truck t1 to go to l1_1, but t1 is initially in l1_8. So drive t1 from l1_8 to l1_1, load p1 into t1, then drive to l1_6. But that would require moving t1 around. But maybe that's part of the plan.

But also, there are constraints. Let's look at the constraints one by one.

Constraints:
1. "Package p1 is in a2" must hold in at least one state.
2. If p1 is in a2 in state s, then p1 must be in l1_3 in s or later.
Wait, but the goal is p1 in l1_6. So this is a problem. Because if p1 is in a2 at some point, then we have to make sure that after that, p1 ends up in l1_3. But the goal is p1 in l1_6. That's conflicting. Wait, maybe I misread. Let me check again.

Wait the constraint says: If "Package p1 is in a2" holds in some state s, then "Package p1 is in location l1_3" must hold at s or after. But the goal requires p1 to be in l1_6. So how do we reconcile this? Because after p1 is in a2, we need to have p1 end up in l1_3, but the goal is l1_6. That seems impossible. Wait, this must be a mistake. Wait, no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the constraints. Let me read them again.

The constraints are:

1. The following must hold in at least one state: p1 is in a2.
2. If p1 is in a2 in state s, then p1 must be in l1_3 in s or after.
3. At least one state where p1 is in t2.
4. If p1 is in t2 in s, then p2 must be in l2_4 in s or after.
5. At least one state where p1 is in l2_4 or p2 in l2_8.
6. At least one state where p2 is in l1_1.
7. At least one state where p2 is in l2_2 or p2 is in a2.

So, the problem is that constraint 2 says that if p1 is ever in a2, then p1 must end up in l1_3. But the goal requires p1 to be in l1_6. This seems conflicting. So how can both be true? The only way is that either:

a) The plan never puts p1 in a2, thus avoiding the need to satisfy constraint 2. But constraint 1 requires that p1 is in a2 at least once. So we can't avoid that. Therefore, we have to satisfy both constraints.

Wait, but this seems impossible. Because the goal is p1 in l1_6, but constraint 2 says that once p1 is in a2, it must end up in l1_3. So unless we can have p1 in both l1_6 and l1_3, which is impossible. Therefore, there's a conflict here, but perhaps the constraints can be satisfied in a way that after p1 is in a2, it is moved to l1_3, and then somehow moved again to l1_6. But that would require moving p1 after l1_3, which would complicate things.

Alternatively, maybe the constraints are not all required to hold in the final state, but just somewhere along the plan. Let me check the constraints again.

Constraint 1: p1 must be in a2 at least once.

Constraint 2: whenever p1 is in a2 (in any state s), then p1 must be in l1_3 in s or later. So if p1 is in a2 at some point, then from that point onward, at some state (could be the same or later), p1 must be in l1_3. But the final goal is p1 in l1_6, which is a different location. So this implies that after moving p1 to l1_3, we have to move it again to l1_6. But how? Because the goal requires p1 to be in l1_6. So the plan must include moving p1 from l1_3 to l1_6. But how?

Let me think step by step.

First, the initial positions:

p1 is in l2_5 (c2). To get p1 to l1_6 (c1), we need to transport it from c2 to c1. The fastest way would be to load it onto a truck in c2, drive to the airport (l2_1), load onto a2, fly to l1_1 (c1's airport), unload into a truck (maybe t1) which then drives to l1_6.

But along the way, we have to satisfy the constraints.

But constraint 1 requires that p1 is in a2 at least once, which would happen in this plan. But then constraint 2 says that after p1 is in a2, it must reach l1_3. But the goal is l1_6. So this suggests that after moving p1 to l1_3, we have to move it again to l1_6. But how? Because that would require additional steps.

Similarly, for p2, which starts in l1_6 (c1), needs to go to l1_3 (c1). So perhaps use truck t1 (which is in l1_8) to drive to l1_6, load p2, drive to l1_3, unload.

But let's see the constraints related to p2:

Constraint 4: if p1 is in t2 (which is in c2's city), then p2 must be in l2_4 at or after that state.

Constraint 5: At least one state where p1 is in l2_4 or p2 in l2_8.

Constraint 6: At least one state where p2 is in l1_1.

Constraint 7: At least one state where p2 is in l2_2 or in a2.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let's break it down.

First, for p1:

1. Must be in a2 at some point (constraint 1). So during the plan, load p1 into a2.

2. When that happens, p1 must later be in l1_3 (constraint 2). So after loading into a2 and flying to l1_1, perhaps unload p1 into a truck, drive to l1_3, unload (satisfying constraint 2), then reload into another truck and drive to l1_6. But that adds steps.

But the plan must be optimal, so maybe there's a way to have p1 go through l1_3 on the way to l1_6. For example, if after unloading from a2 at l1_1, load into a truck, drive to l1_3 (unload, which satisfies the constraint), then load again and drive to l1_6. But that's two extra steps. Is there a way to make this efficient?

Alternatively, perhaps after flying to l1_1, unload p1 into a truck, drive to l1_3 (unload to satisfy constraint 2), then load again and drive to l1_6. But that's possible.

For p2:

Needs to go from l1_6 to l1_3. So using truck t1 (which is in l1_8). So drive t1 to l1_6, load p2, drive to l1_3, unload. But there are constraints:

Constraint 6: p2 must be in l1_1 at some point. So we need to get p2 to l1_1. But how? Because p2 starts in l1_6, which is in c1. So perhaps take p2 via truck to l1_1, then maybe load into airplane a1, but that's not necessary. But to get p2 to l1_1, need to drive it there. So after loading p2 into t1 at l1_6, drive to l1_1 (unload, satisfying constraint 6), then drive back to l1_3. But that's adding steps. But the plan has to be optimal. Maybe there's a way to route through l1_1.

Alternatively, after moving p2 to l1_3, but the constraint requires that p2 is in l1_1 at some point. So maybe during the movement of p2, take a detour to l1_1.

But that would require more steps. Let's see: t1 starts at l1_8. So drive to l1_6 (load p2), then drive to l1_1 (unload p2 there, satisfying constraint 6), then drive to l1_3 and unload. But that's two extra drives. But the problem states that the plan must be optimal, so the minimal steps. Hmm, but maybe there's no other way.

Additionally, constraint 7: p2 must be in l2_2 or in a2. But p2 is in c1, so how to get it to l2_2 (c2) or into a2 (which is in c2's airport, l2_1). Wait, a2 is an airplane, so it can fly to l1_1. If a2 is used to carry p2, but that would require getting p2 into a2. But p2 starts in c1. So maybe:

- Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1 (c1's airport), load p2 into a2 (but p2 is in l1_6, so need to drive it to l1_1 first). Then fly a2 back to l2_1, unload p2 into l2_1 (airport of c2), which is in city c2. Then, to get p2 back to c1, but that seems complicated. But constraint 7 just needs p2 to be in l2_2 or a2 at some point. So maybe if we can load p2 into a2 in l1_1, then fly a2 to some location, but that would require p2 to be in a2, satisfying the "p2 is in a2" part of constraint 7. Then unload p2 back into c1. But this adds steps.

Alternatively, maybe during the transport of p1, we can have p2 moved to a2. Let me think.

But this is getting complex. Let's try to outline possible steps for each package.

For p1:

1. In l2_5 (c2). Need to get to l1_6 (c1).

Possible steps:

- Load into t2 (which is in l2_3). To do that, drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_5 (drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2). Then load p1 into t2 (loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5). Then drive t2 to l2_1 (airport of c2) (drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2). Then unload p1 at l2_1, load into a2 (loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1). Fly a2 to l1_1 (flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1). Then unload p1 from a2 (unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1). Now p1 is in l1_1. Then load into t1 (if t1 is there). But t1 is initially in l1_8. So drive t1 from l1_8 to l1_1 (drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_1 c1). Load p1 into t1 (loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1). Then drive t1 to l1_6 (drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_6 c1). Unload p1 (unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_6). That gets p1 to the goal.

But along the way:

- p1 is in a2 (when loaded into a2 and flown to l1_1), which satisfies constraint 1. Then, per constraint 2, after that, p1 must be in l1_3. But in the current plan, p1 is unloaded at l1_1, then moved to l1_6. So this violates constraint 2. So the plan is invalid.

So to satisfy constraint 2, after p1 is in a2 (at l2_1 or during flight), once it's unloaded in l1_1, we need to get it to l1_3. So perhaps after unloading at l1_1, load into t1, drive to l1_3, unload (satisfying constraint 2), then load again into t1, drive to l1_6, unload. But that adds steps. But that's necessary.

So steps for p1 would be:

- Load into t2, drive to l2_1, load into a2, fly to l1_1.

- Unload from a2 into l1_1.

- Load into t1, drive to l1_3, unload (now constraint 2 is satisfied as after being in a2, p1 is in l1_3).

- Then load into t1 again, drive to l1_6, unload.

But this adds two more steps (unload at l1_3, then load again, drive, unload). So the plan length increases.

But this is necessary to meet constraint 2.

Now, for p2:

p2 starts in l1_6 (c1) and needs to go to l1_3. So using t1, which is initially in l1_8.

But t1 is used for p1's transport. So need to see the timing. Let's outline the steps:

Steps for p1:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
3. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
5. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
6. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
7. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
8. drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_1 c1
9. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
10. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
11. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
12. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
13. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_6 c1
14. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_6

But steps 12 and 13 are needed to move p1 from l1_3 to l1_6. But this adds two steps. However, the problem requires an optimal plan. Maybe there's a way to combine steps, but I don't see it.

Now, for p2:

p2 is in l1_6. To move to l1_3, using t1. But t1 is being used for p1's transport. So perhaps after step 8 (t1 is at l1_1), but that's after moving p1. Alternatively, maybe use another truck. Wait, the trucks available are t1 (c1) and t2 (c2). So in c1, only t1 is available. So yes, t1 has to be used for both p1 and p2.

But let's see. After step 14, t1 is at l1_6. But p2 needs to be moved from l1_6 to l1_3. So maybe after step 14, drive t1 from l1_6 to l1_3 (but p2 is in l1_6). So steps for p2 could be:

15. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_6 (step 14)
16. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_6
17. drivetruck t1 l1_6 l1_3 c1
18. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

But this adds steps after p1 is delivered. However, this would work, but we have to check constraints related to p2.

Constraints for p2:

- Constraint 3: p1 must be in t2 at some point. So during p1's transport, when p1 is in t2 (steps 2-4), that's covered.

- Constraint 4: if p1 is in t2 in state s, then p2 must be in l2_4 at or after s. So after step 2 (p1 loaded into t2), we need p2 to be in l2_4 at some point. But p2 is in l1_6 (c1), so how can it get to l2_4 (c2)? That would require moving p2 from c1 to c2. But the goal is to have p2 in l1_3. So this seems impossible. Wait, but the constraint says that if p1 is in t2, then p2 must be in l2_4 at or after that state. So p1 is loaded into t2 in step 2. So from that point onward, p2 must reach l2_4. But p2 starts in c1. So we need to transport p2 to c2, specifically to l2_4. Then bring it back to c1. But that's a lot of steps. How can this be done optimally?

This complicates things. Because to satisfy constraint 4, after p1 is loaded into t2 (step 2), we need to have p2 in l2_4 at some later step. But p2 is initially in l1_6 (c1). So how to get it to l2_4 (c2)?

One approach: Use an airplane to transport p2 from c1 to c2. For example, load p2 into a1 (which is at l1_1), fly to l2_1, unload, then load into t2 (which is in c2), drive to l2_4, unload. Then, to get p2 back to c1 for the goal, fly again. But this adds many steps. But the constraints require that at least one state has p2 in l2_4. So maybe this is necessary.

But this would require:

For p2:

- Drive t1 to l1_6 (original position?), load p2, drive to l1_1 (airport), unload.

- Load into a1, fly to l2_1 (c2's airport), unload.

- Load into t2 (which is at l2_1 after step 3?), drive to l2_4, unload.

But this satisfies constraint 4 (p2 in l2_4 after p1 was in t2). Then, to get p2 back to c1 for the goal, we need to transport it back. But this is getting very complicated.

But perhaps there's a smarter way. Let's see:

The constraints are:

3. At least one state where p1 is in t2.

4. If p1 is in t2 in s, then p2 must be in l2_4 at s or after.

So step 2 is when p1 is loaded into t2. So after that, p2 must be in l2_4 at some point.

But p2 is in c1. So we need to get p2 to l2_4.

Options:

Option A: Transport p2 from c1 to c2, specifically to l2_4.

This requires:

- Moving p2 from l1_6 (c1) to l1_1 (airport) via truck t1.

- Load into a1 (airplane in l1_1), fly to l2_1 (c2's airport).

- Unload, load into t2 (which is in l2_1 after step 3), drive to l2_4, unload.

Then, to get p2 back to c1 for the goal:

- Load into t2 again, drive to l2_1, load into a2, fly to l1_1, unload, load into t1, drive to l1_3.

This would satisfy constraint 4 (p2 in l2_4), but adds a lot of steps. But the plan must be optimal. However, maybe this is necessary.

Alternatively, can we satisfy constraint 5, which requires that at least one state where p1 is in l2_4 or p2 in l2_8. If we can have p2 in l2_8, that could satisfy constraint 5. But p2 is in c1. So how? It would still require moving p2 to c2.

Alternatively, maybe p1 can be in l2_4. But p1 starts in l2_5 (c2). So if we can get p1 to l2_4 during its transport. For example, when moving p1 from l2_5 to l2_1, but l2_5 to l2_1 may not pass through l2_4. Wait, the cities have locations l2_1 to l2_8. The truck can move between any locations in the same city. So to get from l2_5 to l2_1, can the truck drive directly? Yes. But if we take a detour through l2_4, that would add steps but satisfy constraint 5. For example:

After loading p1 into t2 at l2_5, drive t2 to l2_4 (unload p1 there?), then drive to l2_1. But then p1 would be in l2_4 at some point, satisfying the first part of constraint 5 (p1 in l2_4). Then constraint 5 is satisfied. But this would require:

- drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2 (unload p1 there?), but if we just drive through, p1 is still in t2. So to have p1 in l2_4, we would need to unload it there. But that complicates the plan. Alternatively, if p1 is in t2 while in l2_4, does that count as p1 being in l2_4? No, because p1 is in the truck. The location of p1 is the truck's location only if it's in the truck. So to have p1 in l2_4, we need to unload it there. But that's not part of the optimal plan. So maybe this is not feasible.

Alternatively, perhaps after step 2 (p1 loaded into t2), drive t2 to l2_4 (step 3a: drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2), then drive to l2_1 (step 3b: drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2). This way, while t2 is in l2_4, p1 is in t2, which is in l2_4. So p1's location is l2_4 (since it's in the truck which is in l2_4). So this would satisfy constraint 5's first option (p1 in l2_4) without unloading. So step 3a and 3b. But this adds an extra driving step, making the plan longer. But perhaps this is necessary.

So, modifying the p1 steps:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2 (t2 moves to l2_5)
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (p1 in t2)
3. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2 (move to l2_4)
4. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2 (move to airport)
5. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
6. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
7. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
8. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
9. drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_1 c1
10. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
11. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1 (unload here)
12. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
13. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
14. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_6 c1
15. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_6

This way, when t2 is in l2_4 (step 3), p1 is in t2, which is in l2_4. So constraint 5 is satisfied (p1 is in l2_4). This removes the need to move p2 to l2_4 or l2_8. Because constraint 5 can be satisfied by p1 being in l2_4. So that's better.

Now, for constraint 4: when p1 is in t2 (steps 2-5), we need p2 to be in l2_4 at some point after. But if we use the detour through l2_4 for p1, then constraint 5 is satisfied, and constraint 4 is satisfied only if p2 is in l2_4 after step 2. But p2 is in l1_6 (c1). So this doesn't help. So we still have to satisfy constraint 4.

Hmm, this is getting really complicated. Let me try to list all constraints again and see how to satisfy them:

Constraints:

1. p1 in a2 at least once. Covered when p1 is loaded into a2 (step 6).

2. Whenever p1 is in a2, then p1 must be in l1_3 after. So after step 6, p1 is flown to l1_1, unloaded (step 8), then moved to l1_3 (steps 9-11). So when p1 is in a2 (step 6), after that, it's moved to l1_3 (step 12), satisfying constraint 2.

3. p1 in t2 at least once. Covered in steps 2-5.

4. If p1 is in t2 (steps 2-5), then p2 must be in l2_4 after. So during or after steps 2-5, p2 must be in l2_4. But p2 starts in l1_6 (c1). So how to get p2 to l2_4 (c2)?

This seems challenging. One possible solution is to transport p2 to l2_4. But how?

For p2 to get to l2_4:

- Move p2 from l1_6 to l1_1 (using t1).

- Load into a1, fly to l2_1.

- Unload, load into t2, drive to l2_4, unload.

This would require:

For p2:

16. drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_6 c1 (if t1 is available. Wait, t1 is initially in l1_8. But in the p1 plan, t1 is used to move p1 from l1_8 to l1_1 (step 9). So after step 9, t1 is in l1_1. So to move p2 from l1_6 to l1_1, we need to have t1 drive to l1_6 after step 14. But step 14 is after p1 is delivered. So maybe we need to interleave the steps.

Alternatively, maybe use another truck, but there's only t1 in c1. So no.

Alternatively, during the transport of p1, after step 9 (t1 is in l1_1), can we use t1 to move p2?

But p2 is in l1_6. So after step 9, t1 is in l1_1. To get to l1_6, need to drive t1 to l1_6, load p2, drive to l1_1, unload, then load into a1, fly to l2_1. But this would be:

For p2:

After step 9:

10. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_6 c1 (to pick up p2)
11. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_6
12. drivetruck t1 l1_6 l1_1 c1
13. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
14. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
15. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
16. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
17. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (t2 is in l2_1 after step 4)
18. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
19. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

Now, after step 19, p2 is in l2_4, satisfying constraint 4 (since p1 was in t2 during steps 2-5, and p2 reaches l2_4 at step 19, which is after steps 2-5). So this works.

But then, to get p2 back to c1's l1_3 (the goal), we need to:

20. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
21. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
22. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
23. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (if a2 is there. But a2 was flown to l1_1 in step 7. So after step 7, a2 is in l1_1. So to load p2 into a2, we need to fly a2 back to l2_1. But this adds steps:

24. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
25. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
26. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
27. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
28. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
29. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
30. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

But this is a lot of steps. However, the constraints also require:

Constraint 6: p2 must be in l1_1. This is satisfied when p2 is unloaded at l1_1 in step 27.

Constraint 7: p2 must be in l2_2 or in a2. When p2 is loaded into a2 in step 25, that satisfies the "p2 in a2" part of constraint 7.

So this would satisfy all constraints. But the plan becomes very long. The problem asks for an optimal plan, which is the shortest possible. This suggests that there's a more efficient way.

Let me rethink the approach. Maybe there's a way to have p2 in a2 during its transport. For example:

- After p2 is in l1_1 (step 13), instead of loading into a1, load into a2. But a2 is in l1_1 after step 7. So:

14. loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (instead of a1)
15. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
16. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
17. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
18. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
19. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

Then, to get p2 back:

20. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
21. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
22. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
23. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
24. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
25. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
26. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
27. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
28. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

This way, p2 is in a2 during step 14-15 and 23-24, satisfying constraint 7 (p2 in a2). Also, step 19 satisfies constraint 4 (p2 in l2_4 after p1 was in t2). Also, step 25 unloads p2 in l1_1, satisfying constraint 6. Constraint 5 is satisfied by p1 being in l2_4 during step 3. 

But this still adds many steps. However, since the problem requires an optimal plan, perhaps there's a way to combine some steps. For example, when a2 is flown back to l2_1 to carry p2, maybe we can use the same flight for other purposes.

Alternatively, maybe during the initial flight of a2 to l1_1 (step 7), we can carry both p1 and p2. But p2 is in c1's l1_6. So to load p2 into a2, it needs to be in l1_1. So perhaps after step 7, a2 is in l1_1. Then, after moving p1 to l1_3, use a2 to carry p2 to c2.

But this requires:

- After step 14 (p1 in l1_6), move p2 to l1_1.

- Load p2 into a2, fly to l2_1, unload, load into t2, drive to l2_4, unload (satisfy constraint 4), then load back into t2, drive to l2_1, load into a2, fly to l1_1, unload, then drive to l1_3.

But this is still many steps.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to satisfy constraint 4 by having p2 in l2_4 after p1 is in t2, but without physically moving p2 there. But I don't think so; the constraints require that the package is actually in the location.

This is getting really complicated, and I'm not sure if there's a shorter path. Let's try to outline the entire plan step by step, integrating all necessary actions for both packages and constraints.

Integrated plan outline:

For p1:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2 (t2 moves to l2_5)
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (p1 in t2; satisfies constraint 3)
3. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2 (move to l2_4; p1 in t2 here, so p1 is in l2_4, satisfying constraint 5)
4. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2 (move to airport)
5. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (p1 now in l2_1)
6. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (p1 in a2; satisfies constraint 1)
7. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (a2 arrives at l1_1)
8. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (p1 in l1_1)
9. drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_1 c1 (t1 moves to l1_1)
10. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (p1 in t1)
11. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1 (move to l1_3)
12. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (p1 in l1_3; satisfies constraint 2)
13. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (reload p1)
14. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_6 c1 (move to l1_6)
15. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_6 (p1 reaches goal)

For p2:

p2 starts in l1_6. Need to move to l1_3. But we also need to satisfy constraints 4, 5, 6, 7.

To satisfy constraint 4 (after p1 is in t2, p2 must be in l2_4), we need to move p2 to l2_4. But how?

Let's interleave steps for p2:

After step 3 (p1 in t2 at l2_4), but we need to move p2 to l2_4. So:

But p2 is in l1_6 (c1). To move to l2_4 (c2), we need to:

- Drive t1 to l1_6 (but t1 is in l1_8 initially, then after step 9, t1 is in l1_1).

So after step 9 (t1 in l1_1):

16. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_6 c1 (move to l1_6)
17. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_6 (load p2)
18. drivetruck t1 l1_6 l1_1 c1 (return to l1_1; unload p2 here)
19. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (p2 in l1_1; satisfies constraint 6)
20. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (load into a1)
21. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (fly to c2's airport)
22. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (p2 in l2_1)
23. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (t2 is in l2_1 after step 4)
24. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2 (drive to l2_4)
25. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (p2 in l2_4; satisfies constraint 4)
26. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (reload)
27. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2 (drive back to airport)
28. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (p2 in l2_1)
29. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (load into a2)
30. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (fly back to c1's airport)
31. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (p2 in l1_1; now in a2 during step 29-30, satisfying constraint 7)
32. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (load into t1)
33. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1 (drive to goal)
34. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (p2 reaches goal)

But this adds a lot of steps. However, the problem requires an optimal plan, which is the shortest possible. This plan seems very long, so there must be a shorter way.

Alternative approach: Maybe use a2 to carry both p1 and p2 at different times.

For example:

- Use a2 to fly p1 from l2_1 to l1_1 (steps 6-7).

- Then fly a2 back to l2_1 to pick up p2.

But p2 is in l1_6. So first, move p2 to l1_1:

16. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_6 c1 (after step 9)
17. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_6
18. drivetruck t1 l1_6 l1_1 c1
19. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (p2 in l1_1; satisfies constraint 6)
20. loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (but a2 is in l1_1 after step 7)
21. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1 (fly to c2's airport)
22. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (p2 in l2_1)
23. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (t2 is in l2_1 after step 4)
24. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
25. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (satisfies constraint 4)
26. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
27. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
28. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
29. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
30. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
31. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (satisfies constraint 7 when p2 is in a2 during steps 20-21 and 29-30)
32. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
33. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
34. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

But even this is 34 steps. This can't be optimal. There must be a better way.

Wait, maybe constraint 4 can be satisfied by having p2 in l2_4 after p1 is in t2. But if p1 is in t2 during steps 2-5, then p2 needs to be in l2_4 at some point after step 2. But if we can have p2 in l2_4 during the same steps, perhaps by moving p2 to l2_4 before moving p1.

But p2 starts in l1_6 (c1). To get to l2_4 (c2), it must be flown. So maybe use a1 to fly p2 to c2.

But this requires:

For p2:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_6 c1
2. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_6
3. drivetruck t1 l1_6 l1_1 c1
4. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
5. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
6. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
7. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
8. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
9. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
10. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (satisfies constraint 4)

But this sequence must happen after p1 is loaded into t2 (step 2). So perhaps interleave these steps.

Overall plan outline:

For p1 and p2:

p1 steps:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (constraint 3)
3. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 (drive directly to airport)
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
5. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (constraint 1)
6. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
7. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
8. drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_1 c1
9. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
10. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
11. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (constraint 2)
12. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
13. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_6 c1
14. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_6 (p1 goal)

p2 steps:

15. drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_6 c1 (before step 8)
Wait, but t1 is in l1_8 initially. So steps for p2 must be interleaved.

Wait, after step 8, t1 is in l1_1. But to move p2, we need t1 to be in l1_6. So perhaps:

After step 14 (t1 is in l1_6), but p2 is already in l1_6. So:

15. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_6
16. drivetruck t1 l1_6 l1_3 c1
17. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (p2 goal)

But this doesn't satisfy the constraints 4,5,6,7.

So this approach doesn't work. Thus, the constraints require additional steps.

Given the complexity, perhaps the correct plan is as follows, integrating all necessary steps:

```
drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_1 c1
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_6 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_6
drivetruck t1 l1_6 l1_1 c1
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_6
drivetruck t1 l1_6 l1_1 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
```

But this plan has many steps, and I'm not sure if it's optimal. However, given the constraints, this might be the minimal steps required. Each constraint is addressed:

- p1 is in a2 (step 5).

- After that, p1 is moved to l1_3 (step 11).

- p1 is in t2 (steps 2-4).

- After that, p2 is moved to l2_4 (step 22).

- At step 22, p2 is in l2_4, satisfying constraint 5 via p1 being in l2_4 earlier (not sure, but maybe p2 in l2_4 satisfies constraint 5's second option).

- p2 is in l1_1 (step 17).

- p2 is in a2 (steps 18-19).

However, this plan might not be optimal. Perhaps there's a way to combine steps. For example, after step 14 (p1 is unloaded in l1_6), t1 is in l1_6. Load p2 into t1 there (step 15), drive to l1_3 (step 16), unload (step 17). But this would satisfy p2's goal, but not the other constraints.

But this skips the necessary steps to get p2 to l2_4 and l1_1. So this plan would fail constraints.

Given the time constraints, I think the correct answer requires the following steps, carefully ensuring all constraints are met. However, due to the complexity, I might have missed a more optimal path. But here's the best attempt:
