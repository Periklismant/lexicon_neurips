Let me break down this problem:

1. We have two cities `c1` and `c2`.
2. Each city has 8 locations: `l1_1`, `l1_2`, ... up to `l1_8` for city `c1` and `l2_1`, `l2_2`, ... up to `l2_8` for city `c2`.
3. `l1_1` is an airport in city `c1`, and `l2_1` is an airport in city `c2`.
4. We have 2 packages (`p1` and `p2`), 2 trucks (`t1` and `t2`), and 2 airplanes (`a1` and `a2`).
5. The initial locations of the objects are:
   - `t1` is in location `l1_8` (city `c1`)
   - `t2` is in location `l2_3` (city `c2`)
   - `p1` is in location `l2_5` (city `c2`)
   - `p2` is in location `l1_6` (city `c1`)
   - `a1` is in location `l1_1` (city `c1`'s airport)
   - `a2` is in location `l2_1` (city `c2`'s airport)

6. The goal is to ensure:
   - Package `p1` is in location `l1_6` (in city `c1`)
   - Package `p2` is in location `l1_3` (in city `c1`)

7. Constraints:
   - Package `p1` must be in airplane `a2` at some point, and after that, it should be in location `l1_3` at some point.
   - Package `p1` must be in truck `t2` at some point, and after that, package `p2` should be in location `l2_4` at some point.
   - At some point, at least one of these must be true: Package `p1` is in location `l2_4`, or package `p2` is in location `l2_8`.
   - Package `p2` must be in location `l1_1` at some point.
   - At some point, at least one of these must be true: Package `p2` is in location `l2_2`, or package `p2` is in airplane `a2`.

Now, let's think step-by-step to create a plan:

1. **Initial Setup**: 
   - `p1` is in `l2_5` in city `c2`. We need to move it to `l1_6` in city `c1`.
   - `p2` is in `l1_6` in city `c1`. We need to move it to `l1_3` in city `c1`.

2. **Constraints Analysis**:
   - We need to put `p1` in airplane `a2` at some point, and after that, it should be in location `l1_3` at some point.
   - We also need to put `p1` in truck `t2` at some point, and after that, `p2` should be in location `l2_4` at some point.
   - We need to ensure `p1` is in location `l2_4` or `p2` is in location `l2_8` at some point.
   - `p2` needs to be in location `l1_1` at some point.
   - `p2` needs to be in location `l2_2` or in airplane `a2` at some point.

Let's draft a high-level plan:

1. First, let's move `p1` from `l2_5` to `l1_6` (the goal location):
   - Use truck `t2` to move `p1` from `l2_5` to `l2_4` (satisfying the constraint that `p1` must be in `t2` at some point).
   - The constraint that says after `p1` is in `t2`, `p2` should be in `l2_4` at some point.
   - Then, move `p1` to the airport `l2_1` in city `c2`.
   - Load `p1` onto airplane `a2` (satisfying the constraint that `p1` must be in `a2` at some point).
   - Fly `a2` to the airport `l1_1` in city `c1`.
   - Unload `p1` at `l1_1`.
   - Move `p1` to `l1_3` using truck `t1` (satisfying the constraint from step 1: after `p1` is in `a2`, it should be in `l1_3` at some point).
   - Move `p1` from `l1_3` to `l1_6` using truck `t1` (the goal location).

2. Meanwhile, for `p2`:
   - Move `p2` from `l1_6` to `l1_1` using truck `t1` (satisfying the constraint that `p2` must be in `l1_1` at some point).
   - Load `p2` onto airplane `a1`.
   - Fly `a1` to the airport `l2_1` in city `c2`.
   - Unload `p2` at `l2_1`.
   - Move `p2` to `l2_2` using truck `t2` (satisfying the constraint that `p2` must be in `l2_2` or in airplane `a2` at some point).
   - Move `p2` to `l2_4` (satisfying the constraint from step 1: after `p1` is in `t2`, `p2` should be in `l2_4` at some point).
   - Move `p2` to `l2_8` (satisfying the constraint that `p1` is in `l2_4` or `p2` is in `l2_8` at some point).
   - Move `p2` back to `l2_1`.
   - Load `p2` onto airplane `a2`.
   - Fly `a2` to the airport `l1_1` in city `c1`.
   - Unload `p2` at `l1_1`.
   - Move `p2` to `l1_3` using truck `t1` (the goal location).

Now, let me convert this high-level plan into a sequence of actions based on the available actions in the domain.

Wait, let me refine the plan a bit since I noticed a few inconsistencies. One important consideration is to minimize the number of actions while adhering to the constraints. Another consideration is to ensure the constraints are satisfied in the proper order.

Let's revise the state of the world:
- `t1` is in location `l1_8` (city `c1`)
- `t2` is in location `l2_3` (city `c2`)
- `p1` is in location `l2_5` (city `c2`)
- `p2` is in location `l1_6` (city `c1`)
- `a1` is in location `l1_1` (city `c1`'s airport)
- `a2` is in location `l2_1` (city `c2`'s airport)

Let's develop a detailed plan:

1. Constraint: `p1` must be in truck `t2` at some point, and after that, `p2` should be in location `l2_4`:
   - Move truck `t2` from `l2_3` to `l2_5`, pick up `p1`, then drop it off at `l2_4`.
   - This means we will need to ensure `p2` is in location `l2_4` at some point after this.

2. Constraint: At some point, at least one of these must be true: Package `p1` is in location `l2_4` or package `p2` is in location `l2_8`:
   - We've already ensured `p1` is in `l2_4`, satisfying this constraint.

3. Constraint: Package `p1` must be in airplane `a2` at some point, and after that, it should be in location `l1_3` at some point:
   - From `l2_4`, move `p1` to airport `l2_1` using `t2`.
   - Load `p1` onto `a2` and fly to `l1_1`.
   - Unload `p1` and ensure it ends up in `l1_3` at some point.

4. Constraint: Package `p2` needs to be in location `l1_1` at some point and also in location `l2_2` or in airplane `a2` at some point:
   - Move truck `t1` from `l1_8` to `l1_6` and pick up `p2`.
   - Take `p2` to `l1_1` using `t1`.
   - Load `p2` onto `a1` and fly to `l2_1`.
   - Ensure `p2` is in `l2_4` (from constraint 1).
   - Bring `p2` back to `l1_1` and then to its goal location `l1_3`.

Ok, now let me convert all of this to a fully detailed plan. Let me consider the actions step by step:

1. Move truck `t2` from `l2_3` (its initial location) to `l2_5` (where `p1` is located):
   - `drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2`

2. Load `p1` onto `t2`:
   - `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5`

3. Drive `t2` from `l2_5` to `l2_4`:
   - `drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2`

4. Unload `p1` at `l2_4`:
   - `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4`

(Constraint satisfied: `p1` has been in `t2` and now is in `l2_4`, so the constraints that `p1` must be in `t2` at some point, and the constraint that at some point, at least one of: (1) `p1` is in `l2_4`, (2) `p2` is in `l2_8`, must be true, are satisfied.)

5. Drive `t2` from `l2_4` to `l2_1` (the airport):
   - `drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2`

   - `loadtruck p2 t1 l1_6`

23. Unload `p2` at `l2_4`:
    - `unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4`

(Constraint satisfied: After `p1` has been in `t2`, `p2` is now in `l2_4`.)

    - `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1`

27. Load `p1` onto `a2`:
    - `loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1`

(Constraint satisfied: `p1` has been in `a2`.)

28. Fly `a2` from `l2_1` to `l1_1`:

    - `drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1`

32. Unload `p1` at `l1_3`:
    - `unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3`

(Constraint satisfied: After `p1` has been in `a2`, it's now in `l1_3`.)

    - `loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3`

34. Drive `t1` from `l1_3` to `l1_6`:
    - `drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_6 c1`

35. Unload `p1` at `l1_6`:
    - `unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_6`

(First goal satisfied: `p1` is in `l1_6`.)

45. Unload `p2` at `l1_3`:
    - `unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3`

(Second goal satisfied: `p2` is in `l1_3`.)

Hmm, I notice some issues in my plan. Let me go back and check if I've made any errors in my reasoning.

In step #15, I'm loading `p1` onto `t2` in `l2_4`, but I previously dropped `p1` at `l2_4` and then moved `t2` away to other locations. At this point, `p1` is not in `l2_4` anymore, so this action is invalid.

Let me re-do this a bit more carefully.

First, let's clarify the initial state:
- `t1` is in location `l1_8` (city `c1`)
- `t2` is in location `l2_3` (city `c2`)
- `p1` is in location `l2_5` (city `c2`)
- `p2` is in location `l1_6` (city `c1`)
- `a1` is in location `l1_1` (city `c1`'s airport)
- `a2` is in location `l2_1` (city `c2`'s airport)

Let's develop a better plan:

1. Constraint: `p1` must be in truck `t2` at some point, and after that, `p2` should be in location `l2_4`:
   - Move truck `t2` from `l2_3` to `l2_5`.
   - Load `p1` onto `t2`.
   - This satisfies the constraint that `p1` must be in truck `t2` at some point.

2. Constraint: At some point, at least one of these must be true: Package `p1` is in location `l2_4` or package `p2` is in location `l2_8`:
   - Drive `t2` from `l2_5` to `l2_4`.
   - Unload `p1` at `l2_4`.
   - This satisfies the constraint.

3. Constraint: Package `p1` must be in airplane `a2` at some point, and after that, it should be in location `l1_3` at some point:
   - Drive `t2` from `l2_4` to the airport `l2_1`.
   - Load `p1` onto `t2` again.
   - Drive `t2` to `l2_1`.
   - Unload `p1` at `l2_1`.
   - Load `p1` onto `a2`.
   - Fly `a2` to `l1_1`.
   - Unload `p1` at `l1_1`.
   - Use truck `t1` to move `p1` from `l1_1` to `l1_3`.

4. Constraint: After `p1` is in `t2`, `p2` should be in location `l2_4` at some point:
   - We need to ensure `p2` is at `l2_4` at some point after steps 1-3.

5. Constraint: `p2` needs to be in location `l1_1` at some point and also in location `l2_2` or in airplane `a2` at some point:
   - Move truck `t1` from `l1_8` to `l1_6`.
   - Load `p2` onto `t1`.
   - Drive `t1` to `l1_1`.
   - Unload `p2` at `l1_1`.
   - This satisfies the constraint that `p2` needs to be in location `l1_1` at some point.
   - To satisfy the other constraint, we'll ensure `p2` is loaded onto `a2` later.

6. Constraint: After `p1` is in `t2`, `p2` should be in location `l2_4` at some point:
   - After loading `p2` onto `a2` (from step 5), fly `a2` to `l2_1`.
   - Unload `p2` at `l2_1`.
   - Use truck `t2` to move `p2` from `l2_1` to `l2_4`.
   - This satisfies the constraint.

7. Goal: `p1` should be in location `l1_6` and `p2` should be in location `l1_3`:
   - Drive `t1` from `l1_3` (where we left `p1`) to `l1_6`.
   - Load `p1` onto `t1`.
   - Drive `t1` to `l1_6`.
   - Unload `p1` at `l1_6`.
   - This satisfies the first goal.
   - Move `p2` from `l2_4` to `l1_3` to satisfy the second goal.

Now, let's convert the plan to a step-by-step sequence of actions:

1. Move truck `t2` from `l2_3` to `l2_5`:
   - `drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2`

2. Load `p1` onto `t2`:

   - `unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1`

(Constraint satisfied: `p2` has been in `l1_1`.)

    - `drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2`

(Constraint satisfied: After `p1` has been in `a2`, it's now in `l1_3`.)

20. Load `p2` onto `a2`:
    - `loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1`

(Constraint satisfied: `p2` has been in `a2`.)

21. Fly `a2` from `l1_1` to `l2_1`:
    - `flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1`

22. Unload `p2` at `l2_1`:
    - `unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1`

23. Drive `t2` from `l2_1` to `l2_2`:
    - `drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2`

24. Drive `t2` from `l2_2` to `l2_4`:
    - `drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2`

26. Drive `t2` from `l2_1` to `l2_4`:
    - `drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2`

27. Unload `p2` at `l2_4`:

(Constraint satisfied: After `p1` has been in `t2`, `p2` is now in `l2_4`.)

28. Drive `t1` from `l1_3` to `l1_6`:
    - `drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_6 c1`

    - `loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3`

30. Drive `t1` from `l1_3` to `l1_6`:
    - `drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_6 c1`

31. Unload `p1` at `l1_6`:
    - `unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_6`

(First goal satisfied: `p1` is in `l1_6`.)

32. Load `p2` onto `t2`:
    - `loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4`

40. Unload `p2` at `l1_3`:
    - `unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3`

(Second goal satisfied: `p2` is in `l1_3`.)

Hm, this is still not quite right. Let's review it more systematically.

There are a lot of mistakes in my earlier plan. Let me rebuild this from scratch with a clear trace of where each object is. I'll use the following notation to track locations:
- `t1: l1_8` - Means truck `t1` is at location `l1_8`
- `p1: t1` - Means package `p1` is in truck `t1`

Initial state:
- `t1: l1_8` (city `c1`)
- `t2: l2_3` (city `c2`)
- `p1: l2_5` (city `c2`)
- `p2: l1_6` (city `c1`)
- `a1: l1_1` (city `c1`'s airport)
- `a2: l2_1` (city `c2`'s airport)

Goal:
- `p1: l1_6` (city `c1`)
- `p2: l1_3` (city `c1`)

Let's create a step-by-step plan:

1. `drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2`
   - Now: `t2: l2_5` (city `c2`)

2. `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5`
   - Now: `p1: t2`
   - (Constraint satisfied: `p1` has been in `t2`.)

3. `drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2`
   - Now: `t2: l2_4` (city `c2`)

4. `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4`
   - Now: `p1: l2_4` (city `c2`)
   - (Constraint satisfied: `p1` has been in `l2_4`.)

5. `drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2`

Wait, we still haven't satisfied the constraint: After `p1` is in `t2`, `p2` should be in location `l2_4` at some point.

Here's where I think I can simplify. Let me try again, more systematically.

Initial state:
- `t1: l1_8` (city `c1`)
- `t2: l2_3` (city `c2`)
- `p1: l2_5` (city `c2`)
- `p2: l1_6` (city `c1`)
- `a1: l1_1` (city `c1`'s airport)
- `a2: l2_1` (city `c2`'s airport)

Let's check if the constraints can be satisfied. The first constraint requires `p1` to be in `t2` at some point, and after that, `p2` should be in `l2_4`. The second constraint requires `p1` to be in `a2` at some point, and after that, `p1` should be in `l1_3` at some point. There's also a constraint that either `p1` is in `l2_4` or `p2` is in `l2_8`. Another constraint is that `p2` must be in `l1_1` at some point. Finally, either `p2` is in `l2_2` or `p2` is in `a2`.

Let's come up with a plan that satisfies these constraints efficiently:

1. Move `t2` to `l2_5`, load `p1`, and move to `l2_4`. This satisfies the constraint that `p1` must be in `t2` at some point.
2. Unload `p1` at `l2_4`. This satisfies the constraint that `p1` must be in `l2_4` at some point.
3. Move `t2` to `l2_1` and transfer `p1` to `a2`. This satisfies the constraint that `p1` must be in `a2` at some point.
4. Fly `a2` to `l1_1` and unload `p1`.
5. Move `t1` to `l1_6`, load `p2`, and take it to `l1_1`. This satisfies the constraint that `p2` must be in `l1_1` at some point.
6. Load `p2` into `a2`. This satisfies the constraint that `p2` must be in `a2` at some point.
7. Fly `a2` to `l2_1`, unload `p2`, and use `t2` to move `p2` to `l2_4`. This satisfies the constraint that after `p1` is in `t2`, `p2` should be in `l2_4` at some point.
8. Use `t1` to move `p1` from `l1_1` to `l1_3`. This satisfies the constraint that after `p1` is in `a2`, it should be in `l1_3` at some point.
9. Move `p1` to its final destination, `l1_6`.
10. Move `p2` from `l2_4` to its final destination, `l1_3`.

Now, let's convert this into a detailed plan:

1. `drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2`

   - (Constraint satisfied: `p1` has been in `t2`.)

    - (Constraint satisfied: After `p1` has been in `t2`, `p2` is now in `l2_4`.)
26. `loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1`
27. `drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1`
28. `unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3`
    - (Constraint satisfied: After `p1` has been in `a2`, it's now in `l1_3`.)
29. `loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3`
30. `drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_6 c1`
31. `unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_6`
    - (First goal satisfied: `p1` is in `l1_6`.)
32. `loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4`
33. `drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2`
34. `unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1`
35. `loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1`
36. `flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1`
37. `unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1`
38. `loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1`
39. `drivetruck t1 l1_6 l1_3 c1`
40. `unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3`
    - (Second goal satisfied: `p2` is in `l1_3`.)

Oh, I made a mistake in steps 6-7. I already unloaded `p1` at `l2_4` in step 4, so it's not in the truck anymore when I try to move the truck.

    - Now: `t1: l1_6`, `t2: l2_1`, `p1: l1_6`, `p2: a2`, `a1: l1_1`, `a2: l1_1`

37. `unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1`
    - Now: `t1: l1_6`, `t2: l2_1`, `p1: l1_6`, `p2: l1_1`, `a1: l1_1`, `a2: l1_1`

38. `loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1`
    - But wait, `t1` is at `l1_6`, not `l1_1`. Let's correct this.

38. `drivetruck t1 l1_6 l1_1 c1`
    - Now: `t1: l1_1`, `t2: l2_1`, `p1: l1_6`, `p2: l1_1`, `a1: l1_1`, `a2: l1_1`

39. `loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1`
    - Now: `t1: l1_1`, `t2: l2_1`, `p1: l1_6`, `p2: t1`, `a1: l1_1`, `a2: l1_1`

40. `drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1`
    - Now: `t1: l1_3`, `t2: l2_1`, `p1: l1_6`, `p2: t1`, `a1: l1_1`, `a2: l1_1`

41. `unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3`
    - Now: `t1: l1_3`, `t2: l2_1`, `p1: l1_6`, `p2: l1_3`, `a1: l1_1`, `a2: l1_1`
    - (Second goal satisfied: `p2` is in `l1_3`.)

That's the complete plan. All constraints are satisfied, and both goals are met.

Let me check if there's any redundancy I can eliminate:

1. `drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2`
2. `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5`
3. `drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2`
4. `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4`
5. `drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2`
6. `drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2`
7. `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4`
8. `drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2`
9. `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1`
10. `loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1`
11. `flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1`
12. `unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1`
13. `drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_6 c1`
14. `loadtruck p2 t1 l1_6`
15. `drivetruck t1 l1_6 l1_1 c1`
16. `unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1`
17. `loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1`
18. `flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1`
19. `unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1`
20. `loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1`
21. `drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2`
22. `unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2`
23. `loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2`
24. `drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2`
25. `unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4`
26. `loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1`
27. `drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1`
28. `unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3`
29. `loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3`
30. `drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_6 c1`
31. `unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_6`
32. `loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4`
33. `drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2`
34. `unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1`
35. `loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1`
36. `flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1`
37. `unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1`
38. `drivetruck t1 l1_6 l1_1 c1`
39. `loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1`
40. `drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1`
41. `unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3`

But actually, I want to check another way to optimize the plan. Instead of going back and forth between, for example, `l2_1` and `l2_4`, can we optimize the movement?

1. Start with `p1` at `l2_5` and `p2` at `l1_6`.
2. Move `t2` to `l2_5`, load `p1`, drive to `l2_4`, and unload. This satisfies the constraint that `p1` must be in `l2_4` at some point.
3. Move `p1` to the airport `l2_1`, and load it onto `a2`.
4. Move `p2` to the airport `l1_1` and load it onto `a1`.
5. Fly `a1` to `l2_1` and unload `p2`.
6. Move `p2` to `l2_2` using `t2`, then move it to `l2_4`. This satisfies the constraints that `p2` must be in `l2_2` at some point and that after `p1` is in `t2`, `p2` should be in `l2_4` at some point.
7. Fly `a2` (carrying `p1`) to `l1_1` and unload.
8. Move `p1` to `l1_3` using `t1`, then move it to `l1_6`.
9. Move `p2` from `l2_4` back to the airport `l2_1`, load it onto `a2`, and fly to `l1_1`.
10. Unload `p2` and move it to `l1_3` using `t1`.

Actually, I'll stick with the detailed plan I elaborated earlier. It's a bit more efficient.

Let me just check if there's any way to reduce steps:

6. `drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2` (step 6)
7. `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4` (step 7)
8. `drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2` (step 8)

These could be redundant, but they are needed to satisfy the constraint that after `p1` is in `t2`, `p2` should be in `l2_4` at some point. Since we can't load `p2` into `t2` and have it at `l2_4` while `p1` is still in the truck, we need to do this.

But actually steps 21-25 relate to loading `p2` onto `t2`, driving to `l2_2`, unloading, loading, driving to `l2_4`, and unloading. This is to satisfy the constraints that `p2` must be at `l2_2` at some point and that after `p1` is in `t2`, `p2` should be in `l2_4` at some point.

Similarly, steps 26-31 involve loading `p1` onto `t1`, driving to `l1_3`, unloading, loading, driving to `l1_6`, and unloading. This is to satisfy the constraint that after `p1` is in `a2`, it should be in `l1_3` at some point.

And steps 32-41 are for getting `p2` to its final destination.

Let me try once more to check if there's efficiency we can improve here.

Ah, I think the issue was with `t1`. It's initially at `l1_8`, and we move it to `l1_6` to pick up `p2`. But what if we do this:

1. Move `t1` from `l1_8` to `l1_6` (to pick up `p2`).
2. After dropping `p2` at `l1_1`, use `t1` to immediately pick up `p1` when it arrives at `l1_1` from `a2`.
3. Use `t1` to move `p1` to `l1_3`, then to `l1_6`.
4. Then use `t1` to pick up `p2` from `l1_1` (when it returns from `a2` after the loading/unloading in city `c2`) and move it to `l1_3`.

This way, we avoid redundant `t1` movements.

Hmm, but this wouldn't work because by the time `p2` is back at `l1_1` (from the airport) after its journey to `c2`, `t1` would already be at `l1_6` (after dropping `p1` there).

Alright, I think the plan I outlined is already quite efficient. Let's recap the final plan:

```
drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2

drivetruck t1 l1_6 l1_1 c1
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
```

Let me take a moment to verify this.

Actually, I need to make corrections to steps 20-25. After we unload `p2` at `l2_1` in step 19, we need to load it onto `t2`. Then, drive to `l2_2`, unload, reload, drive to `l2_4`, and unload. But `t2` is already at `l2_1` in step 19, so we don't need to drive it there.

Corrected steps:

```

Actually, let me review the constraints just to be sure we've met all.

1. `p1` must be in truck `t2` at some point, and after that, `p2` should be in location `l2_4` at some point:
   - `p1` is in truck `t2` at steps 2-3 and 7-8.
   - `p2` is in location `l2_4` at step 25, after `p1` has been in `t2`.

2. `p1` must be in airplane `a2` at some point, and after that, it should be in location `l1_3` at some point:
   - `p1` is in airplane `a2` at steps 10-11.
   - `p1` is in location `l1_3` at step 28, after `p1` has been in `a2`.

3. At some point, at least one of these must be true: Package `p1` is in location `l2_4` or package `p2` is in location `l2_8`:
   - `p1` is in location `l2_4` at step 4.

4. Package `p2` needs to be in location `l1_1` at some point:
   - `p2` is in location `l1_1` at step 16.

5. At some point, at least one of these must be true: Package `p2` is in location `l2_2` or package `p2` is in airplane `a2`:
   - `p2` is in location `l2_2` at step 22.
   - `p2` is in airplane `a2` at steps 17-18 and 35-36.

6. The goal is to bring about the following situation: `p
