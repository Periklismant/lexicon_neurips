Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. Hmm, the goal is to get p1 to l1_4 and p2 to l2_4. But there are a bunch of constraints to satisfy. Let me start by understanding the initial state and the constraints step by step.

First, the initial state. The packages: p1 and p2 are both in l2_2, which is in city c2. Trucks t1 is in l1_3 (city c1) and t2 is in l2_5 (city c2). Airplanes a1 is in l1_1 (airport in c1) and a2 is in l2_1 (airport in c2).

The goal is p1 at l1_4 (c1) and p2 at l2_4 (c2). So, p1 needs to move from c2 to c1. Since cities are connected via airports and airplanes, probably need to use an airplane to transport p1 between cities.

Constraints are complicated. Let me list them:

1. p1 must be in l2_1 (airport in c2) at least once. So, we need to get p1 there.

2. Whenever p1 is in l2_1, there must have been a previous state where either p2 is in l1_3 or p1 is in l2_4. But since the goal requires p2 to be in l2_4, which is in c2, maybe we need to have p1 reach l2_4 first? Wait, but the goal is p1 in l1_4. So this constraint might mean that before p1 is in l2_1, p2 has to be in l1_3 or p1 is in l2_4. But since p2 starts in l2_2, getting it to l1_3 would require moving between cities. That's possible via airplane. Alternatively, maybe we can have p1 reach l2_4 at some point.

3. p1 must be in l1_1 (airport in c1) at least once. So, after transporting via airplane to c1, unload at l1_1.

4. If p1 is in l1_1 in some state, then either p1 must be in l1_5 or p2 in l2_1 at or after that state. So, after p1 is in l1_1, we need to ensure one of those happens. Since the goal is p1 in l1_4, maybe after unloading at l1_1, we move p1 via truck to l1_4. But l1_5 is another location in c1. Alternatively, maybe after getting p1 to l1_1, we need to have p2 reach l2_1. But p2's goal is l2_4, which is in c2. So l2_1 is an airport in c2. To get p2 to l2_4, maybe we need to use a truck in c2.

5. p1 must be in l2_2 (initial location) at some state. Well, it starts there, so that's already satisfied. Wait, the initial state says p1 is in l2_2. So this constraint is already met in the initial state. So we don't need to do anything here except maybe ensure that the constraint is considered. But since the initial state is part of the plan's states, this constraint is already satisfied.

6. If p1 is in l2_2 in some state, then after that, either p1 must be in l1_5 or l2_3. Since the initial state has p1 in l2_2, this constraint applies. So in the plan, after the initial state, p1 must eventually reach l1_5 or l2_3. But since p1's goal is l1_4 (in c1), perhaps moving p1 to l2_3 (in c2) would complicate things. So maybe we need to move p1 from l2_2 to l2_3 at some point, but then how to get it to c1? Alternatively, maybe moving p1 via airplane to c1's airport and then to l1_5. Wait, l1_5 is in c1. So perhaps after moving p1 to l1_1 (airport), then move it to l1_5 via truck, then to l1_4.

7. p2 must be in l2_4 (goal) at some state. That's part of the goal, so that's required.

8. Whenever p2 is in l2_4, there must be an earlier state where p1 is in l1_5. So before p2 reaches l2_4, p1 must have been in l1_5. So p1 has to reach l1_5 before p2 reaches l2_4.

9. p1 must be in l2_4 at some state. Wait, but the goal is p1 in l1_4. So this is a constraint that p1 must be in l2_4 in some state. So even though the goal is l1_4, we need to have p1 in l2_4 at some point. But how? That's in c2. So maybe we need to first move p1 to l2_4, then move it back to c1. But that's complicated. Let's see.

So, let's outline the steps needed for the goals first, then see how to incorporate the constraints.

Goal 1: p1 in l1_4 (c1). Since p1 starts in l2_2 (c2), we need to transport it from c2 to c1. So steps would be: load p1 into a truck in c2, drive to airport l2_1, load onto airplane a2, fly to l1_1, unload, load onto truck in c1 (t1 is in l1_3, so maybe need to drive t1 to l1_1?), then drive to l1_4.

But wait, t1 is initially in l1_3. So to load p1 into t1, t1 must be at l1_1. So we need to drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1. But that's in c1. So possible steps:

For p1:

1. In c2, move p1 from l2_2 to l2_1 (airport) using truck t2. But t2 is in l2_5. So first drive t2 to l2_2, load p1, then drive to l2_1.

Wait, initial positions: t2 is in l2_5. So to load p1 (in l2_2), need t2 to drive from l2_5 to l2_2. Then load p1 into t2, drive to l2_1. Then load p1 into airplane a2 (which is at l2_1), fly a2 to l1_1. Unload p1 there. Then, in c1, t1 is in l1_3. So drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1, load p1 into t1, then drive to l1_4 and unload.

But this would handle p1's movement. For p2's goal: p2 in l2_4. It starts in l2_2. So use truck t2 (which is in l2_5 initially) to pick up p2 from l2_2, drive to l2_4, unload. But to do that, first, t2 needs to be in l2_2. But after moving p1, t2 would be at l2_1. Hmm, so maybe need to handle the order of moving p1 and p2.

But let's outline steps for p1 first:

1. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2.

2. Load p1 into t2 at l2_2.

3. Drive t2 to l2_1.

4. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1.

5. Load p1 into airplane a2 at l2_1.

6. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.

7. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1.

8. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1.

9. Load p1 into t1 at l1_1.

10. Drive t1 to l1_4.

11. Unload p1 at l1_4.

But step 8-11 handle p1's movement in c1.

For p2:

Need to get p2 from l2_2 to l2_4. Since t2 is initially in l2_5, after moving p1, t2 is at l2_1. So perhaps after moving p1, we need to drive t2 back to l2_2 to pick up p2.

Wait, but steps for p1 would involve t2 moving from l2_5 to l2_2 (step 1), then to l2_1 (step 3). So after step 3, t2 is at l2_1, and p1 is loaded into t2. Then unload p1 at l2_1 (step4). Then t2 is empty at l2_1. So then, to move p2, perhaps we can drive t2 back to l2_2, load p2, drive to l2_4, unload.

So steps for p2 would be:

12. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2.

13. Load p2 into t2 at l2_2.

14. Drive t2 to l2_4.

15. Unload p2 at l2_4.

But this would handle p2's movement. However, the constraints need to be checked.

Now, let's check the constraints:

Constraint 1: p1 must be in l2_1 at least once. That's achieved in step4, where p1 is unloaded into l2_1. Wait, no. Step4 unloads p1 from t2 into l2_1. So yes, p1 is in l2_1 in that state.

Constraint 2: If p1 is in l2_1 (step4), then there must be an earlier state where either p2 is in l1_3 or p1 is in l2_4. But in the current steps, before step4, the earlier steps are 1-3. So, p2 starts in l2_2. To get p2 to l1_3 (c1), which is a city c1 location, would require moving via airplane. But that's not part of the plan. Alternatively, p1 needs to be in l2_4 before step4. But in the current plan, p1 is moved to l2_1, then flown to c1. So this constraint might not be satisfied. Therefore, the plan as outlined would violate constraint2. So we need to adjust the plan to satisfy this.

So how to satisfy constraint2: When p1 is in l2_1 (step4), there must be an earlier state where either p2 is in l1_3 or p1 is in l2_4. So we need to have either p2 in l1_3 before step4, or p1 in l2_4 before step4.

But in the current plan, neither is true. So to satisfy this, we need to adjust the plan. Let's think:

Option 1: Before moving p1 to l2_1, have p1 go to l2_4 first. But how? Since p1 starts in l2_2. So maybe drive t2 to l2_2, load p1, drive to l2_4, unload, then load again and drive to l2_1. But that would add steps.

Wait, here's an idea:

First, move p1 from l2_2 to l2_4 (using t2), which would satisfy the constraint that when p1 is in l2_1, there was a previous state where p1 was in l2_4. Then, move p1 from l2_4 to l2_1. But how? Because l2_4 is in c2. To move from l2_4 to l2_1, need to drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1. So steps would be:

1. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2.

2. Load p1 into t2 at l2_2.

3. Drive t2 to l2_4.

4. Unload p1 at l2_4 (now p1 is in l2_4, which satisfies constraint9, which requires p1 to be in l2_4 at some state).

Then, load p1 back into t2 at l2_4.

5. Drive t2 to l2_1.

6. Unload p1 at l2_1.

Then proceed to fly p1 to c1. But this adds steps but satisfies constraint2, because when p1 is in l2_1 (step6), there was a previous state (step4) where p1 was in l2_4. So this satisfies constraint2.

But then, constraint9 (p1 in l2_4) is satisfied in step4.

Also, constraint8 says that when p2 is in l2_4 (goal), there must be an earlier state where p1 is in l1_5. So in the plan, after p1 is in l1_5 (which is in c1), but in the current steps, p1 is in l2_4 (c2) before being moved to c1. But we need to have p1 reach l1_5 before p2 is in l2_4.

Wait, p2's movement is to l2_4. So after moving p1 to l1_4 (the goal), we need to have p2 reach l2_4, but before that, p1 must have been in l1_5. But in the current plan, p1 is moved to l1_4, which is not l1_5. So perhaps during the movement of p1 in c1, after unloading at l1_1, we need to drive t1 to l1_5 first, unload p1 there (so p1 is in l1_5), then drive to l1_4 and unload again. That way, p1 is in l1_5 before p2 is in l2_4. Then, when p2 is in l2_4 (step15), there was an earlier state (when p1 was in l1_5). That would satisfy constraint8.

So adjusting the plan for p1 in c1:

After flying to l1_1, unload p1 (step7), drive t1 to l1_1 (step8), load p1 into t1 (step9), drive t1 to l1_5 (step10), unload p1 (step11), then drive t1 to l1_4 (step12), unload p1 (step13). Then, p2's steps would be after step13.

Wait, but this would make p1's goal achieved at step13. Then, for p2, after step13, drive t2 to l2_2, load p2, drive to l2_4, unload. But this would ensure that p1 was in l1_5 (step11) before p2 is in l2_4 (step15). So constraint8 is satisfied.

Also, constraint4: if p1 is in l1_1 (step7), then in the same or later state, either p1 in l1_5 or p2 in l2_1. In the adjusted plan, after step7, p1 is moved to l1_5 (step11), which satisfies the requirement. So that's okay.

Constraint3 requires p1 to be in l1_1. That's achieved in step7 when p1 is unloaded from a1 (assuming a1 is the airplane in c1. Wait, initial state says airplane a1 is in l1_1. Wait, initial state says "Package a1 is in location l1_1". Wait, but airplanes are not packages. Wait, looking back, the initial state says:

Original state:

"Package t1 is in location l1_3"

"Package t2 is in location l2_5"

"Package p1 is in location l2_2"

"Package p2 is in location l2_2"

"Package a1 is in location l1_1"

"Package a2 is in location l2_1"

Wait, that's a problem. The objects are airplanes a1 and a2, but the initial state lists them as packages. That must be a mistake. Because airplanes are not packages. So probably a typo. So in the initial state, the airplanes a1 and a2 are in locations l1_1 and l2_1 respectively. So correcting that:

Initial state:

Airplane a1 is in location l1_1.

Airplane a2 is in location l2_1.

So when you fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1, you need to have it there.

So back to the steps. So in step6, after unloading p1 at l2_1, we load it into a2 (which is at l2_1), then fly a2 to l1_1.

Wait, no. To fly from l2_1 to l1_1, the airplane a2 is at l2_1. So step5: load p1 into a2 at l2_1, then fly a2 to l1_1. Then unload p1 there.

So revised steps for p1:

1. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2.

2. Load p1 into t2 at l2_2.

3. Drive t2 to l2_4.

4. Unload p1 at l2_4. (Now p1 is in l2_4, satisfying constraint9)

5. Load p1 into t2 at l2_4.

6. Drive t2 to l2_1.

7. Unload p1 at l2_1. (Now p1 is in l2_1, satisfying constraint1)

8. Load p1 into a2 at l2_1.

9. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.

10. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1. (Now p1 is in l1_1, satisfying constraint3)

11. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1.

12. Load p1 into t1 at l1_1.

13. Drive t1 to l1_5.

14. Unload p1 at l1_5. (This satisfies the requirement for constraint4, because after p1 is in l1_1, it moves to l1_5, which is one of the conditions. Also, this satisfies constraint8, as p1 is in l1_5 before p2 reaches l2_4.)

15. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_4.

16. Unload p1 at l1_4. (Goal achieved.)

For p2:

17. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2. (t2 was left at l2_1 after step7)

18. Load p2 into t2 at l2_2.

19. Drive t2 to l2_4.

20. Unload p2 at l2_4. (Goal achieved.)

Now, check constraints:

- Constraint1: p1 in l2_1 (step7) yes.

- Constraint2: When p1 is in l2_1 (step7), there must be an earlier state where p2 is in l1_3 or p1 is in l2_4. Earlier steps have p1 in l2_4 (step4). So yes.

- Constraint3: p1 in l1_1 (step10) yes.

- Constraint4: After p1 is in l1_1 (step10), then in some state after, p1 is in l1_5 (step14) or p2 is in l2_1. Yes, step14.

- Constraint5: p1 in l2_2 (initial state). Yes.

- Constraint6: If p1 is in l2_2 (initial state), then in subsequent states, p1 is in l1_5 or l2_3. In the plan, after initial state, p1 moves to l2_4 (step4), then to l2_1, etc. So step4 is l2_4, which is not l1_5 or l2_3. Wait, this is a problem. Because constraint6 requires that after p1 is in l2_2 (which is the initial state), in some state after, p1 must be in l1_5 or l2_3. But in the current plan, after initial state, p1 moves to l2_4 (step4), which is not one of the required locations. So this violates constraint6. So we need to adjust the plan to have p1 go to either l1_5 or l2_3 after being in l2_2.

Hmm. So how to handle this?

Since p1 starts in l2_2, which is in c2. To get to l1_5 (c1), it needs to be transported via airplane. Alternatively, l2_3 is in c2, so moving p1 to l2_3.

But the goal is to get p1 to l1_4. If we move p1 to l2_3 first, then how to get it to c1? Maybe:

After moving p1 to l2_3 (using t2), then to l2_1, then fly to c1. But this adds steps.

So let's adjust the plan for constraint6:

After the initial state, first move p1 to l2_3:

1. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2.

2. Load p1 into t2 at l2_2.

3. Drive t2 to l2_3.

4. Unload p1 at l2_3. (Now p1 is in l2_3, satisfying constraint6's subsequent condition.)

5. Load p1 into t2 at l2_3.

6. Drive t2 to l2_1.

7. Unload p1 at l2_1.

8. Load p1 into a2.

9. Fly a2 to l1_1.

10. Unload p1.

Then proceed as before. But this way, after initial state, p1 is moved to l2_3, which satisfies constraint6. But then the earlier steps for p1's movement to l2_4 (required for constraint9) are missing. So this introduces a problem because constraint9 requires p1 to be in l2_4 at some state. So this approach would not satisfy that.

Alternatively, after moving p1 to l2_4 (to satisfy constraint9), then also move p1 to l2_3 before getting to l2_1. But that's redundant. Alternatively, perhaps we can find a way to have p1 reach l2_3 after initial state.

Wait, the initial state has p1 in l2_2. If we first drive t2 to l2_2, load p1, drive to l2_3, unload, then continue with other steps. But how?

Let me try:

Plan for p1:

1. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2.

2. Load p1 into t2 at l2_2.

3. Drive t2 to l2_3. (Now p1 is in l2_3, satisfying constraint6.)

4. Unload p1 at l2_3.

5. Load p1 into t2 again.

6. Drive t2 to l2_4. (To satisfy constraint9.)

7. Unload p1 at l2_4.

8. Load p1 into t2 again.

9. Drive t2 to l2_1.

10. Unload p1 at l2_1.

11. Load into a2, fly to l1_1.

12. Unload, etc.

But this adds a lot of steps, making the plan longer. However, the problem requires an optimal plan (shortest possible). So this might not be optimal.

Alternative approach: Find a way to satisfy constraint6 without adding too many steps.

Constraint6 says that after p1 is in l2_2 (initial state), in some state after, p1 must be in l1_5 or l2_3. Since the initial state is the first state, we need to have p1 move to one of those locations eventually.

In the original plan (without considering constraint6), p1 moves from l2_2 to l2_4, then to l2_1, etc. So in that case, after the initial state, p1 is in l2_4, which doesn't satisfy constraint6. So that's a problem.

So we need to adjust the plan to ensure that after the initial state, p1 reaches either l1_5 or l2_3.

But how can p1 reach l1_5? That's in c1. So it requires transporting via airplane. But the initial plan already moves p1 to c1. So perhaps after p1 is in l1_1 (c1's airport), when moving it to l1_5, that satisfies the requirement. So maybe the initial plan's step14 (unloading p1 at l1_5) would satisfy this.

Wait, constraint6 requires that after the initial state (where p1 is in l2_2), in some state after, p1 is in l1_5 or l2_3. So in the initial plan's step14, p1 is in l1_5. Since the initial state is the first state, and step14 comes after, that satisfies constraint6. Because p1 reaches l1_5 after the initial state.

Wait, yes! So in the initial plan where p1 is moved from l2_2 to l2_4, then to l2_1, flown to l1_1, then to l1_5, then to l1_4, the state where p1 is in l1_5 (step14) occurs after the initial state. So this satisfies constraint6: after the initial state (p1 in l2_2), there is a state (step14) where p1 is in l1_5. So the constraint is satisfied. Therefore, we don't need to move p1 to l2_3.

Wait, but constraint6 says "if p1 is in l2_2 in some state s, then in s or a subsequent state, p1 must be in l1_5 or l2_3". Since the initial state is s where p1 is in l2_2, then in some subsequent state (like step14), p1 is in l1_5. So that's acceptable. Therefore, the original plan (with steps taking p1 to l1_5) satisfies constraint6.

So that's okay. So no need to adjust for constraint6.

Now, let's check constraint9: p1 must be in l2_4 at least once. In the plan where p1 is moved to l2_4 (step4), that's satisfied.

Constraint7: p2 must be in l2_4 (the goal), which is handled in step20.

Constraint8: when p2 is in l2_4 (step20), there must be an earlier state where p1 is in l1_5. Which is step14, which is earlier. So that's satisfied.

Constraint9: p1 must be in l2_4 (step4).

Constraint5: p1 in l2_2 (initial state) is already satisfied.

Now, let's check all constraints again.

1. p1 in l2_1: step7.

2. When p1 is in l2_1 (step7), there was an earlier state (step4) where p1 was in l2_4. So satisfied.

3. p1 in l1_1: step10.

4. After p1 is in l1_1 (step10), in step14, p1 is in l1_5. Satisfied.

5. p1 in l2_2: initial state.

6. After initial state (p1 in l2_2), in step14, p1 is in l1_5. Satisfied.

7. p2 in l2_4: step20.

8. Before p2 is in l2_4 (step20), p1 was in l1_5 (step14). Satisfied.

9. p1 in l2_4: step4.

All constraints satisfied.

Now, the plan steps would be:

For p1:

1. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2.

2. Load p1 into t2 at l2_2.

3. Drive t2 to l2_4.

4. Unload p1 at l2_4.

5. Load p1 into t2 at l2_4.

6. Drive t2 to l2_1.

7. Unload p1 at l2_1.

8. Load p1 into a2 at l2_1.

9. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.

10. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1.

11. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1.

12. Load p1 into t1 at l1_1.

13. Drive t1 to l1_5.

14. Unload p1 at l1_5.

15. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_4.

16. Unload p1 at l1_4.

For p2:

17. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2.

18. Load p2 into t2 at l2_2.

19. Drive t2 to l2_4.

20. Unload p2 at l2_4.

Now, check if all actions are valid.

For example, step1: drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2. Both are in c2, so valid.

Step2: load p1 into t2 at l2_2. Both are there.

Step3: drive t2 to l2_4 in c2. Valid.

Step4: unload p1 from t2 at l2_4. t2 is there, p1 is in t2.

Step5: load p1 into t2 again at l2_4.

Step6: drive t2 to l2_1 (airport) in c2. Valid.

Step7: unload p1 from t2 at l2_1.

Step8: load p1 into a2 at l2_1. a2 is at l2_1.

Step9: fly a2 to l1_1.

Step10: unload p1 from a2 at l1_1.

Step11: drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1 in c1. Valid.

Step12: load p1 into t1 at l1_1.

Step13: drive t1 to l1_5 in c1.

Step14: unload p1.

Step15: drive t1 to l1_4.

Step16: unload p1.

Then steps for p2:

Step17: drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2 in c2.

Step18: load p2 into t2.

Step19: drive to l2_4.

Step20: unload.

Now, let's count the steps. Is this the optimal plan? Could there be a shorter way?

Alternative approach: Maybe after step7, when p1 is in l2_1, instead of moving p1 to l2_4 first, can we find a different way to satisfy constraint2. But earlier analysis shows that moving p1 to l2_4 is necessary.

Alternatively, maybe use a different truck or airplane. But t2 is the only truck in c2, and a2 is the only airplane in c2.

Alternatively, after moving p1 to l2_1, fly a2 to l1_1, then use t1 to move p1 to l1_4 directly, but that skips the step where p1 is in l1_5. But then constraint8 requires that when p2 is in l2_4, p1 was in l1_5. So if p1 is moved directly to l1_4, then p1 is never in l1_5, which violates constraint8. So we have to move p1 to l1_5.

Thus, the plan as outlined is necessary.

Another possible optimization: Combine steps. For example, after unloading p1 at l1_1 (step10), drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1 (step11) and then to l1_5 and l1_4. But can we drive t1 directly from l1_3 to l1_5 then to l1_4, instead of going to l1_1 first? Wait, no. Because t1 is initially in l1_3. To load p1 into t1, p1 must be in the same location as t1. So p1 is in l1_1 (after step10), so t1 needs to be driven to l1_1 first (step11) to load p1.

So steps 11-16 are necessary.

Another thought: After flying p1 to l1_1, can we use a different truck? But t1 is the only truck in c1. So yes.

Thus, the plan is as outlined.

Now, let's check for any possible errors.

For step9, flying a2 from l2_1 to l1_1. The flyairplane action requires the airplane to be in l_from. a2 is at l2_1, so valid.

After flying, a2 is now in l1_1.

When unloading p1 from a2 in l1_1, that's valid.

Then, drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1: valid.

Load p1 into t1 at l1_1: valid.

Drive to l1_5: yes, same city.

Thus, the plan is valid.

The constraints are all satisfied. The plan length is 20 steps. But can we make it shorter?

Let's see:

Is there a way to combine steps for p1 and p2?

For example, while moving p1, can we also move p2 in parallel? But since the actions are sequential, perhaps not. But maybe interleave steps.

But given that trucks and airplanes are shared resources, we need to check dependencies.

For example, after step7 (t2 at l2_1, unloaded p1), perhaps we can start moving p2 earlier. Let's see:

After step7, t2 is at l2_1. To move p2 from l2_2 to l2_4, t2 needs to go to l2_2. So steps17-20 can be done earlier, perhaps between steps7 and8.

But p2's steps require t2 to be available. Let's see:

After step7: t2 is at l2_1, empty. So:

17. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2.

18. Load p2.

19. Drive to l2_4.

20. Unload p2.

Then, after that, use t2 to move p1 to l2_1. But p1 is already at l2_1 in step7. Wait, no. Step7 is after moving p1 to l2_1. So after step7, p1 is at l2_1, unloaded from t2. So t2 is empty at l2_1. Then, steps17-20 would require t2 to drive back to l2_2 to pick up p2. Then drive to l2_4. Then, after that, perhaps load p1 into a2 and fly.

But this way, the steps for p2 can be interleaved with p1's steps after step7.

But how does that affect the constraints?

Let me try interleaving:

After step7 (unload p1 at l2_1), we can proceed to move p2:

17. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2.

18. Load p2 into t2.

19. Drive to l2_4.

20. Unload p2.

Then, after step20, t2 is at l2_4. But p1 is still at l2_1. To load p1 into a2, we need to have a2 at l2_1, which it is. So:

8. Load p1 into a2 at l2_1.

9. Fly a2 to l1_1.

etc.

But this way, the steps for p2 are done earlier. But does this affect the constraints?

Constraint8: p2 in l2_4 requires p1 to have been in l1_5 before. In this interleaved plan, p2 is unloaded at l2_4 (step20) before p1 is moved to l1_5 (step14). So p1's step14 occurs after p2's step20. Which violates constraint8. Because p2 is in l2_4 (step20) before p1 is in l1_5 (step14). So this is invalid.

Thus, the steps for p2 must come after p1 reaches l1_5.

Thus, the original order of steps is necessary.

Therefore, the plan outlined is the optimal one.
