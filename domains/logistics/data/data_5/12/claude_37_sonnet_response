Let me analyze the problem step by step.

First, I need to understand the initial state:
- Location l1_1 to l1_5 are in city c1, with l1_1 being an airport
- Location l2_1 to l2_5 are in city c2, with l2_1 being an airport
- Truck t1 is in location l1_4
- Truck t2 is in location l2_1
- Package p1 is in location l2_3
- Package p2 is in location l2_5
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

The goal is:
- Package p1 is in location l2_4
- Package p2 is in location l2_1

Now, let's analyze the constraints:
1. p2 must be in l2_1 at some point (which is part of the goal)
2. Before p2 is in l2_1, either p2 must be in l1_4 or p1 must be in l2_5
3. p1 must be in l1_3 at some point
4. p2 must be in l2_2 at some point
5. p2 must be in l2_5 at some point (which is where it starts)
6. If p2 is in l2_5, then p1 must be in l2_5 at that state or some state after
7. At some point, p2 must be in l2_2 and p1 must be in truck t1

Let me think through a potential plan:

Initially:
- p1 is in l2_3
- p2 is in l2_5

Constraint 5 is already satisfied at the initial state (p2 is in l2_5).
Constraint 6 requires that if p2 is in l2_5, p1 must be in l2_5 at that state or after. 
Since p2 is in l2_5 initially, we need to move p1 to l2_5 at some point.

Here's a sketch of a plan:
1. Move t2 from l2_1 to l2_3
2. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_3
3. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_5
4. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_5 (This satisfies constraint 6)
5. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_5
6. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2
7. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_2 (This satisfies constraint 4)
8. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_2
9. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1
10. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1 (This satisfies the goal for p2 and constraint 1)

Now let's handle p1:
11. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_5
12. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_5
13. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_4
14. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_4 (This satisfies the goal for p1)

But wait, I'm missing constraints 3 and 7.

For constraint 3, p1 needs to be in l1_3, which is in city c1. This requires an airplane to transport p1 from city c2 to city c1. After placing p1 in l1_3, we'll need to return it to l2_4 for the goal.

For constraint 7, p1 needs to be in truck t1 while p2 is in l2_2. But t1 is in l1_4 initially, which is in a different city than where we need it.

So, I need a more complex plan:

1. Move t2 from l2_1 to l2_3
2. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_3
3. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_5
4. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_5 (This satisfies constraint 6)
5. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_5
6. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2
7. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_2 (This satisfies constraint 4)

Now, we need to satisfy constraint 7, which requires p1 to be in t1 while p2 is in l2_2.
8. Move t1 from l1_4 to l1_1 (airport)
9. Load t1 onto a1 at l1_1
10. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1
11. Unload t1 from a1 at l2_1
12. Drive t1 from l2_1 to l2_5
13. Load p1 onto t1 at l2_5
14. Drive t1 from l2_5 to l2_2 (Now p1 is in t1 and p2 is in l2_2, satisfying constraint 7)

Wait, that doesn't make sense. We can't load a truck onto an airplane. Let me reconsider.

I think I misunderstood. t1 and t2 are trucks, not packages. Let me revise.

Starting from the initial state:
- p1 is in l2_3
- p2 is in l2_5
- t1 is in l1_4
- t2 is in l2_1
- a1 is in l1_1
- a2 is in l2_1

Let's see how we can satisfy all the constraints:

1. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_3
2. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_3
3. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_5
4. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_5 (Satisfies constraint 6)

Now, p1 needs to be in t1 when p2 is in l2_2 (constraint 7). Since t1 is in city c1, we need to fly p1 to city c1.

5. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_5
6. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (airport)
7. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1
8. Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1
9. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1
10. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1
11. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1
12. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_1
13. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_3
14. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_3 (Satisfies constraint 3)
15. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_3

Meanwhile, let's move p2:

16. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_5
17. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_5
18. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2
19. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_2 (Now p1 is in t1 and p2 is in l2_2, satisfying constraint 7)

But wait, this doesn't quite work because p1 and t1 are in different cities when p2 is in l2_2. So I need to bring t1 to city c2.

Let me reconsider. Actually, I'm going to more carefully go through the constraints and ensure I satisfy all of them.

Constraint 1: "Package p2 is in location l2_1" must be true at some state. (This is part of the goal.)
Constraint 2: Before p2 is in l2_1, either p2 must be in l1_4 or p1 must be in l2_5. 
Constraint 3: "Package p1 is in location l1_3" must be true at some state.
Constraint 4: "Package p2 is in location l2_2" must be true at some state.
Constraint 5: "Package p2 is in location l2_5" must be true at some state. (This is satisfied in the initial state.)
Constraint 6: If p2 is in l2_5, then p1 must be in l2_5 at that state or some state after.
Constraint 7: "Package p2 is in location l2_2" and "Package p1 is in t1" must be true at the same state.

Let's start by satisfying constraint 6. Since p2 is in l2_5 initially, we need to move p1 to l2_5.

1. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_3
2. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_3
3. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_5
4. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_5 (Satisfies constraint 6)

Now, let's satisfy constraint 7. We need p1 in t1 and p2 in l2_2 at the same time. This means t1 must be in city c2, not in city c1 where it starts.

5. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1 (airport)
6. Load t1 onto a1 at l1_1

Oh, I misunderstood again. Trucks can only move between locations within a city; they can't be loaded onto airplanes. I need to be more careful.

Let's see. t1 is in l1_4 (city c1) and p1 is in l2_5 (city c2). To have p1 in t1, p1 must be moved to city c1 or t1 must be moved to city c2. As we just realized, t1 can't be flown to city c2. Therefore, p1 must be flown to city c1.

Also, for the goal, p1 needs to be in l2_4 and p2 needs to be in l2_1 at the end.

Let me start fresh with a new plan:

1. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_3
2. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_3
3. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_5
4. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_5 (Satisfies constraint 6)

Now, let's satisfy constraint 2. Before p2 is in l2_1 (which is part of the goal), either p2 must be in l1_4 or p1 must be in l2_5. Since p1 is now in l2_5, constraint 2 is satisfied.

Let's continue:

5. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_5
6. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2
7. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_2 (Satisfies constraint 4)

Now, for constraint 7, we need p1 in t1 and p2 in l2_2 at the same time. Since p2 is in l2_2 and t1 is in l1_4, we can't satisfy this constraint with p1 in l2_5. We need to move p1 to city c1, ideally to load it onto t1.

8. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_5
9. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (airport)
10. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1
11. Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1
12. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1
13. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1
14. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1
15. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_1

But now p2 is not in l2_2 anymore. This is a challenge. Let's reconsider.

Actually, it seems like there's a mismatch between the constraints. Constraint 7 requires p1 to be in t1 when p2 is in l2_2. But t1 starts in city c1 and p2 is in city c2. Without being able to move trucks between cities, this seems impossible to satisfy.

Let me double-check if I misunderstood any of the constraints or the problem.

Oh, I see a problem with my understanding. I was confusing the package and the truck. In the initial state:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_4
- Truck t2 is in location l2_1
- Package p1 is in location l2_3
- Package p2 is in location l2_5
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

I wasn't interpreting the initial state correctly. Let me reconsider the constraints with the correct initial state.

Constraint 1: "Package p2 is in location l2_1" must be true at some state. (This is part of the goal.)
Constraint 2: Before p2 is in l2_1, either p2 must be in l1_4 or p1 must be in l2_5.
Constraint 3: "Package p1 is in location l1_3" must be true at some state.
Constraint 4: "Package p2 is in location l2_2" must be true at some state.
Constraint 5: "Package p2 is in location l2_5" must be true at some state. (This is satisfied in the initial state.)
Constraint 6: If p2 is in l2_5, then p1 must be in l2_5 at that state or some state after.
Constraint 7: "Package p2 is in location l2_2" and "Package p1 is in t1" must be true at the same state.

Given that p2 is in l2_5 initially, and the constraint 6 states that if p2 is in l2_5, then p1 must be in l2_5 at that state or some state after, we need to first move p1 to l2_5.

But wait, constraint 7 requires p1 to be in truck t1 when p2 is in l2_2. Given that t1 is in city c1 and p2 is in city c2, and trucks can't travel between cities, this seems unfeasible.

Let me re-read the constraints and make sure I'm understanding them correctly.

I believe I'm interpreting the constraints correctly. Constraint 7 requires p1 to be in truck t1 when p2 is in l2_2. If trucks can only move within a city and t1 is in city c1 while p2 is in city c2, then this constraint cannot be satisfied.

Unless... maybe we can interpret "Package p1 is in t1" as loading and unloading the package in the truck, not necessarily both being in the same location at the same time? That's perhaps stretching the interpretation.

Let me reconsider. Maybe we need to get p1 to a location in city c1, then move t1 to that location, load p1 into t1, and keep p1 in t1 for a period of time. During this period, we need to ensure p2 is in l2_2. This is still problematic because the two are in different cities.

I'm feeling stuck on constraint 7. Maybe there's something I'm not understanding about the problem or its representation.

Hmm, let me re-read the constraints once more.

I think I understand now. Constraint 7 states: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "The following conditions are all true: "Package p2 is in location l2_2", "Package p1 is in t1"""

This means that at some state S in our plan, p2 must be in l2_2 AND p1 must be in t1. It doesn't mean that t1 and l2_2 have to be in the same location or city. p1 is in t1 means p1 is loaded in truck t1, which can be in any location of its city. But at the exact same state, p2 must be in l2_2.

So, if we have p1 in t1 (in city c1) and p2 in l2_2 (in city c2) at the same state, then constraint 7, 4 and are satisfied. But we would still need to eventually get p1 into l2_4 (for the goal).

But for constraint 6, if p2 is in l2_5 (which it is initially), then p1 must be in l2_5 at that state or some state after. So before p2 leaves l2_5, we need to ensure p1 reaches l2_5.

Constraint 3 requires p1 to be in l1_3 at some point.

Based on all these, here's a potential plan:

1. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_3
2. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_3
3. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_5
4. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_5 (Satisfies constraint 6)
5. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_5
6. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2
7. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_2 (Satisfies constraint 4)

8. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_3
9. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_5
10. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (airport)
11. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1
12. Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1
13. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1
14. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1
15. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1
16. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_1 (At this point, p1 is in t1 in city c1, and p2 is in l2_2 in city c2, satisfying constraint 7)
17. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_3
18. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_3 (Satisfies constraint 3)
19. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_3
20. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1 (airport)
21. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1
22. Load p1 onto a1 at l1_1
23. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1
24. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1

25. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1
26. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_2
27. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1
28. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1 (Satisfies constraint 1 and part of the goal)

29. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_1
30. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4
31. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_4 (Satisfies the other part of the goal)

But wait, after step 7, p2 is in l2_2. So for steps 25-26, I should have had p2 already in l2_2, not loading it again. Let me correct this.

25. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_2
26. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1
27. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1 (Satisfies constraint 1 and part of the goal)

Now, let's check constraint 2. Before p2 is in l2_1, either p2 must be in l1_4 or p1 must be in l2_5. Up to step 27, p2 has been in l2_5 and l2_2, not in l1_4. And p1 was in l2_5 only before step 9. So before step 27, p1 is not in l2_5 and p2 is not in l1_4. This means we don't satisfy constraint 2.

Let me modify the plan to satisfy constraint 2:

1. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_3
2. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_3
3. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_5
4. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_5 (Satisfies constraint 6)

9. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_5
10. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (airport)
11. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1

So, at this point, p1 is in l2_1. Now, let's move p1 to l1_4 (as required by constraint 2) before moving p2 to l2_1:

12. Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1
13. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1
14. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1
15. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1
16. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_1
17. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_4
18. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_4 (This places p1 in l1_4, which is the condition for constraint 2)

Now, let's move p2 to l2_1 (for the goal and to satisfy constraint 1):

19. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_5
20. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_5
21. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2
22. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_2 (Satisfies constraint 4)

23. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_4 (Now p1 is in t1 and p2 is in l2_2, satisfying constraint 7)

24. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_3
25. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_3 (Satisfies constraint 3)

26. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_3
27. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1 (airport)
28. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1
29. Load p1 onto a1 at l1_1
30. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1
31. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1

32. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_2
33. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1
34. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1 (Satisfies constraint 1 and part of the goal)

35. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_1
36. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4
37. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_4 (Satisfies the other part of the goal)

But there's an issue with step 23. After step 18, p1 is in l1_4. In step 23, I load p1 onto t1 at l1_4, but then in step 19, I move t2 from l2_1 to l2_5. These are happening in parallel, which is not how the plan works. I need to be more careful with the ordering.

Let me revise more carefully:

1. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_3
2. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_3
3. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_5
4. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_5 (Satisfies constraint 6)
5. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_5
6. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (airport)
7. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1
8. Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1
9. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1
10. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1
11. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1
12. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_1
13. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_4
14. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_4 (This places p1 in l1_4, which is the condition for constraint 2)
15. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_3
16. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_4
17. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_3 (Satisfies constraint 3)
18. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_5
19. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_5
20. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2
21. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_2 (Satisfies constraint 4)
22. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_3 (Now p1 is in t1 and p2 is in l2_2, satisfying constraint 7)
23. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1 (airport)
24. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1
25. Load p1 onto a1 at l1_1
26. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1
27. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1
28. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_2
29. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1
30. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1 (Satisfies constraint 1 and part of the goal)
31. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_1
32. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4
33. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_4 (Satisfies the other part of the goal)

But there's still a logic issue in steps 15-16. I can't drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_3 and then load p1 onto t1 at l1_4. Let me revise again:

1. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_3
2. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_3
3. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_5
4. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_5 (Satisfies constraint 6)
5. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_5
6. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (airport)
7. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1
8. Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1
9. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1
10. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1
11. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1
12. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_1
13. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_4
14. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_4 (This places p1 in l1_4, which is the condition for constraint 2)
15. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_4
16. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_3
17. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_3 (Satisfies constraint 3)
18. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_3 (Now p1 is in t1)
19. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_5
20. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_5
21. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2
22. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_2 (Satisfies constraint 4, and now p2 is in l2_2 while p1 is in t1, satisfying constraint 7)
23. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1 (airport)
24. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1
25. Load p1 onto a1 at l1_1
26. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1
27. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1
28. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_2
29. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1
30. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1 (Satisfies constraint 1 and part of the goal)
31. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_1
32. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4
33. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_4 (Satisfies the other part of the goal)

Actually, there's one more issue. The way constraint 2 is phrased: "If expression "Package p2 is in location l2_1" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: "At least one of the following conditions is true: "Package p2 is in location l1_4", "Package p1 is in location l2_5"""

This means that, before p2 reaches l2_1, either p2 must have been in l1_4 or p1 must have been in l2_5. In the current plan, p1 was in l2_5 at step 4, which is before p2 is in l2_1 at step 30, so this constraint is satisfied.

But I want to double-check the exact wording: 

Constraint 2: "If expression "Package p2 is in location l2_1" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: "At least one of the following conditions is true: "Package p2 is in location l1_4", "Package p1 is in location l2_5"""

Yes, this means that if in our plan, p2 ever enters location l2_1, then at some earlier point, either p2 should have been in l1_4 or p1 should have been in l2_5.

In the plan, p2 enters l2_1 at step 30. Before that, p1 was in l2_5 at step 4, which satisfies constraint 2.

Let's check all the constraints once more to make sure our plan satisfies all of them:

Constraint 1: "Package p2 is in location l2_1" must be true at some state. This is satisfied at step 30.
Constraint 2: Before p2 is in l2_1, either p2 must be in l1_4 or p1 must be in l2_5. This is satisfied because p1 is in l2_5 at step 4, before p2 is in l2_1 at step 30.
Constraint 3: "Package p1 is in location l1_3" must be true at some state. This is satisfied at step 17.
Constraint 4: "Package p2 is in location l2_2" must be true at some state. This is satisfied at step 22.
Constraint 5: "Package p2 is in location l2_5" must be true at some state. This is satisfied at the initial state and reaffirmed at step 20.
Constraint 6: If p2 is in l2_5, then p1 must be in l2_5 at that state or some state after. This is satisfied because p2 is in l2_5 initially, and p1 is in l2_5 at step 4.
Constraint 7: "Package p2 is in location l2_2" and "Package p1 is in t1" must be true at the same state. This is satisfied at step 22, where p2 is in l2_2 and p1 is in t1 (from step 18).

And the goal: p1 must be in l2_4 and p2 must be in l2_1. This is satisfied at steps 33 and 30 respectively.

So, it looks like our plan satisfies all the constraints and the goal. Let's formalize it:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
3. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
5. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
6. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2

31. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
32. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
33. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

That's our plan!

Actually, I'm a bit confused by some actions. Let me verify if loadairplane is the correct action for loading a package onto an airplane. I see "loadtruck" for loading a package onto a truck, so it should be consistent.

Checking the actions:
- "loadtruck p t l": Load package p in truck t. Both p and t are in location l.
- "loadairplane p ap l": Load package p in airplane ap. Both p and ap are in location l.
- "unloadtruck p t l": Unload package p from truck t in location l.
- "loadairplane p ap l": Unload package p from airplane ap in location l. (This seems to be a duplicate with the same name, it should be "unloadairplane".)
- "drivetruck t l_from l_to c": Drive truck t from location l_from to location l_to in city c.
- "flyairplane ap l_from l_to": Fly airplane ap from location l_from to location l_to.

I think there's a typo in the action descriptions. "loadairplane p ap l" is listed twice, once for loading and once for unloading. The latter should probably be "unloadairplane p ap l".

With that, I'll update the actions in the plan:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
3. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
5. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
6. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
7. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
8. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
9. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
10. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
11. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
12. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
13. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
14. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
15. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
16. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1
17. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
18. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
19. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
20. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
21. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
22. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
23. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
24. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
25. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
26. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
27. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
28. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
29. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
30. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
31. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
32. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
33. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

This is the final plan.

Actually, I realized there's one more issue in the plan. In step 27, p1 is in l2_1. In step 28, we're loading p2 onto t2 at l2_2, but t2 is in l2_1 at this point. Let me fix this:

27. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
28. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
29. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
30. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
31. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
32. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
33. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
34. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
35. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
36. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

But this introduces redundancy (t2 goes from l2_1 to l2_2 and back again). Let's simplify:

27. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
28. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
29. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
30. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
31. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
32. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
33. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
34. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

But there's another issue. We need to check our changes to ensure the constraints remain satisfied.

Constraint 7: "Package p2 is in location l2_2" and "Package p1 is in t1" must be true at the same state. This is satisfied at step 22, where p2 is in l2_2 and p1 is in t1 (from step 18). This is still true with our changes.

All the other constraints are also still satisfied. So, our updated plan is:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
3. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
5. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
6. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
7. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
8. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
9. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
10. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
11. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
12. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
13. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
14. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
15. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
16. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1
17. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
18. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
19. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
20. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
21. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
22. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
23. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
24. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
25. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
26. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
27. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
28. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
29. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
30. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
31. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
32. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
33. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

Wait, there's a logical inconsistency here. In step 28, t2 is moved from l2_2 to l2_1. But in step 29, we're loading p2 onto t2 at l2_1, which means p2 should be at l2_1. But p2 is at l2_2 after step 22. This doesn't make sense.

Let me scrutinize the plan more carefully:

After step 22: p2 is in l2_2, p1 is in t1 at l1_3.
After step 28: t2 is in l2_1, p2 is in l2_2.

So in step 29, we shouldn't be loading p2 onto t2 at l2_1; p2 is at l2_2. Let's fix this:

27. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
28. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
29. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
30. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
31. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
32. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
33. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
34. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
35. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
36. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
37. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2
38. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

But now I'm introducing a lot of back and forth. Let me see if there's a more efficient way to order the movements.

After step a:
- p1 is in l2_1 (from step 27)
- p2 is in l2_2 (from step 22)
- t2 is in l2_2 (from step 21)

28. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 (Now t2 is in l2_1, p2 is in l2_2, p1 is in l2_1)
29. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
30. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
31. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
32. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
33. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
34. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
35. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

This seems more efficient. But there's another issue: in step 31, we're loading p2 onto t2, but p1 is already in t2 from step 29. Can a truck carry more than one package at a time? Let's check the domain description.

The domain doesn't explicitly say a truck can carry multiple packages, but it also doesn't say it can't. For now, let's assume a truck can carry multiple packages. If it can't, we'd need to modify the plan.

Actually, let's go ahead and assume trucks can carry only one package. Let's revise steps 28-35 to ensure only one package is in a truck at a time:

28. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 (Now t2 is in l2_1, p2 is in l2_2, p1 is in l2_1)
29. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
30. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
31. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
32. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2
33. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
34. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
35. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

This plan avoids having multiple packages in the same truck, and it's still efficient. Let's verify the updated, complete plan meets all the constraints.

1. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
3. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
5. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
6. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
7. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
8. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
9. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
10. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
11. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
12. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
13. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
14. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
15. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
16. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1
17. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
18. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
19. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
20. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
21. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
22. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
23. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
24. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
25. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
26. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
27. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
28. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
29. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
30. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
31. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
32. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2
33. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
34. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
35. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

Constraint 1: "Package p2 is in location l2_1" must be true at some state. This is satisfied at step 35.
Constraint 2: Before p2 is in l2_1, either p2 must be in l1_4 or p1 must be in l2_5. This is satisfied because p1 is in l2_5 at step 4, before p2 is in l2_1 at step 35.
Constraint 3: "Package p1 is in location l1_3" must be true at some state. This is satisfied at step 17.
Constraint 4: "Package p2 is in location l2_2" must be true at some state. This is satisfied at step 22.
Constraint 5: "Package p2 is in location l2_5" must be true at some state. This is satisfied at the initial state and reaffirmed at step 20.
Constraint 6: If p2 is in l2_5, then p1 must be in l2_5 at that state or some state after. This is satisfied because p2 is in l2_5 initially, and p1 is in l2_5 at step 4.
Constraint 7: "Package p2 is in location l2_2" and "Package p1 is in t1" must be true at the same state. This is satisfied at step 22, where p2 is in l2_2 and p1 is in t1 (from step 18).

The goal (p1 in l2_4 and p2 in l2_1) is satisfied at steps 31 and 35, respectively.

This plan successfully meets all the constraints and the goal.

Looking at it more, we can optimize the plan further. For instance, steps 19-22 are unnecessary, as they just leave package p2 in location l2_5 and then move p2 from l2_5 to l2_2, only to move it later to l2_1. We can simplify.

1. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
3. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
5. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
6. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
7. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
8. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
9. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
10. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
11. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
12. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
13. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
14. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
15. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
16. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1
17. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
18. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
19. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
20. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
21. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
22. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
23. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
24. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
25. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
26. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
27. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
28. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
29. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
30. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
31. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2
32. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
33. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
34. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

That's 34 steps. Let's see if we can optimize further.

After step 7, p1 is in l2_1. We then move p1 to l1_4, then to l1_3, and back to l2_1. This is to satisfy various constraints. I think this is the most optimized version.

So, the final plan (using the correct action names) is:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
3. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
5. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
6. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
7. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
8. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
9. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
10. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
11. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
12. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
13. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
14. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
15. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
16. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1
17. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
18. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
19. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
20. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
21. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
22. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
23. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
24. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
25. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
26. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
27. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
28. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
29. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
30. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
31. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2
32. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
33. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
34. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

This is the plan to handle all the constraints and achieve the goal.

Actually, I see one more issue in the plan. In step 28, we load p1 onto t2 at l2_1, but t2 isn't in l2_1 at this point; after the last step mentioning t2, it's in l2_2. I need to add a drive action to move t2 from l2_2 to l2_1 before loading p1. Let me fix this:

27. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
28. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
29. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
30. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
31. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
32. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2
33. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
34. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
35. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

With this correction, our plan is:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
3. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
5. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
6. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
7. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
8. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
9. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
10. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
11. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
12. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
13. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
14. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
15. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
16. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1
17. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
18. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
19. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
20. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
21. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
22. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
23. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
24. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
25. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
26. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
27. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
28. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
29. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
30. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
31. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
32. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2
33. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
34. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
35. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

This should be the final plan that satisfies all the constraints and the goal.
