Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. The goal is to get p1 to l2_6 and p2 to l2_1 while satisfying all the constraints. Let's first list out the constraints to make sure I don't miss any.

First constraint: At some state, p1 must be in a1. So we need to load p1 into airplane a1 at some point.

Second constraint: If p1 is in a1 in some state s, then either p2 is in t1 or t2 in s or in a later state. So after loading p1 into a1, we must ensure that p2 gets into one of the trucks eventually.

Third constraint: At some state, p2 is in a1 or in l1_2. But since the final goal is p2 in l2_1, which is an airport in c2, maybe this constraint is part of the journey. But we have to make sure p2 is either loaded into a1 or placed in l1_2 at some point.

Fourth constraint: p2 must be in l1_3 at some state. So we need to get p2 to l1_3 somehow.

Fifth constraint: p2 must be in t1 at some state. So p2 has to be loaded into truck t1.

Sixth constraint: p1 must be in l2_3 at some state. So during the transportation, p1 has to be there.

Now, let's look at the initial state. 

Initial locations:
- p1 is in l1_2 (c1)
- p2 is in l2_5 (c2)
- t1 is in l1_5 (c1)
- t2 is in l2_4 (c2)
- a1 is in l1_1 (c1's airport)
- a2 is in l2_1 (c2's airport)

The goal is p1 in l2_6 (c2) and p2 in l2_1 (c2's airport). 

So, p1 needs to go from c1 to c2. Since trucks can't move between cities, but airplanes can. So likely, p1 will be transported via airplane a1 or a2. Wait, a1 is in c1's airport l1_1, and a2 is in c2's l2_1. To move p1 from c1 to c2, we need to use an airplane. Let's see: a1 can fly from l1_1 to l2_1 (since airports are in different cities). Then, unload p1 there. But l2_1 is in c2, and then maybe use a truck in c2 to take it to l2_6.

But first, how to get p1 to the airport in c1. Since p1 is in l1_2, which is in c1. So we need to use a truck in c1. t1 is in l1_5. So first, drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_2, load p1 into t1, then drive t1 to l1_1 (the airport), unload p1 there. Then load p1 into a1, fly a1 to l2_1 (c2's airport), unload p1, then maybe use t2 (which is in l2_4 in c2) to drive to l2_1, load p1 into t2, drive to l2_6, unload. But wait, t2 is in l2_4. So drive t2 to l2_1, load p1, then drive to l2_6. But that's a possible path.

But let's check the constraints. The first constraint is that p1 is in a1 at some state. So that's covered when we load p1 into a1.

Second constraint: when p1 is in a1, then p2 must be in t1 or t2 either at that state or later. So while moving p1 via a1, we need to make sure p2 is loaded into one of the trucks.

But p2 is initially in l2_5 (c2). To get p2 into a truck, maybe t2 is in l2_4. So drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_5, load p2 into t2. Then maybe drive t2 somewhere else. But the fifth constraint says p2 must be in t1 at some state. Wait, t1 is in c1. So how can p2 get into t1? Because t1 is in c1 and p2 is in c2. Unless we use an airplane to move p2 to c1. Wait, but airplanes can carry packages. So maybe we need to fly p2 from c2 to c1, load it into t1, then perhaps move it again. But the final goal is p2 in l2_1, so maybe after moving it to c1, we have to move it back. That complicates things. Let's think.

Constraints:

3. At some state, p2 is in a1 or l1_2. 

4. At some state, p2 is in l1_3.

5. At some state, p2 is in t1.

So, p2 needs to be in a1 (airplane) or l1_2 (c1 location) at some point. Also, p2 must be in l1_3 (c1 location) and in t1 (c1's truck). So p2 must be transported to c1, then moved around there. But the final goal is p2 in l2_1 (c2's airport). So after moving p2 to c1, we need to bring it back to c2. That's a lot. Let's outline possible steps for p2:

Initial: p2 in l2_5 (c2). To get it into t1 (c1's truck), we need to move p2 to c1. How? Use an airplane. So load p2 into a2 (since a2 is in l2_1, which is c2's airport). Fly a2 to l1_1 (c1's airport), unload p2 there. Then use t1 to pick it up. But t1 starts in l1_5. So drive t1 to l1_1, load p2 into t1. Then drive t1 to l1_3 (to fulfill constraint 4), unload p2 there. Then maybe drive t1 again to l1_1, load p2, fly back via a1 to c2's airport l2_1. But that's getting complicated. Also, the third constraint requires p2 to be in a1 or l1_2. So if we put p2 in a1 at some point, that would satisfy it, but since a1 is in c1, that might require moving p2 to a1 in c1. Alternatively, if p2 is in l1_2 (c1), which is possible if we move it there via t1.

But let's see: the fifth constraint is p2 in t1. So after moving p2 to c1 via a2, load it into t1, that satisfies constraint 5. Then, maybe drive t1 to l1_3 and unload p2 there (satisfying constraint 4). Then, load p2 back into t1, drive to l1_1, load into a1 (satisfying constraint 3 as p2 is in a1). Then fly a1 to l2_1, unload p2 there (which is the goal). But wait, the final goal is p2 in l2_1. So that would work. But this would require multiple steps for p2.

But the problem is that the constraints must be satisfied in some state. Let's check:

- Constraint 3: p2 in a1 or l1_2. If p2 is loaded into a1, that's covered.

- Constraint 4: p2 in l1_3. So after unloading in l1_3, that's covered.

- Constraint 5: p2 in t1. When loaded into t1, that's covered.

Now, the second constraint: when p1 is in a1 (during its transport), then p2 must be in t1 or t2 at that state or later. So when we load p1 into a1, we need to make sure that p2 is either already in t1/t2 or will be loaded into them later. Let's see: suppose we first handle p2's movement to c1, load into t1, drive to l1_3, unload, then load back into t1, then perhaps move to l1_1, load into a1, then fly to l2_1. Then, when p1 is loaded into a1 (after p2 has been in t1), that would satisfy the second constraint.

But we need to sequence the steps such that when p1 is in a1, p2 is either in t1 or t2 at that time or later. Let's plan the steps in order.

Possible plan outline:

For p1:

1. Move t1 from l1_5 to l1_2 (where p1 is) in c1.
2. Load p1 into t1 at l1_2.
3. Drive t1 to l1_1 (airport).
4. Unload p1 at l1_1.
5. Load p1 into a1.
6. Fly a1 to l2_1 (c2's airport).
7. Unload p1 at l2_1.
8. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
9. Load p1 into t2.
10. Drive t2 to l2_6.
11. Unload p1 at l2_6.

For p2:

a. Move t2 from l2_4 to l2_5 (where p2 is) in c2.
b. Load p2 into t2.
c. Drive t2 to l2_1 (airport).
d. Unload p2 at l2_1.
e. Load p2 into a2.
f. Fly a2 to l1_1 (c1's airport).
g. Unload p2 at l1_1.
h. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_3 (since t1 is already at l1_1 after step 3? Wait, after step 3, t1 is at l1_1. Then, after unloading p1 (step4), t1 is still at l1_1. So maybe after step4, drive t1 to l1_3 (but why?).

Wait, let's adjust. For p2:

After step e (loading into a2) and flying to l1_1 (step f), then unload p2 (step g). Then, drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_1? No. Wait, t1 is at l1_1 after step3 (driving to l1_1). Then, in step4, p1 is unloaded there, so t1 is still at l1_1. So after step4, we can use t1 to load p2. Wait, but p2 is in l1_1 (after step g). So steps for p2:

a. In c2, t2 starts at l2_4. Drive t2 to l2_5 (p2's location).

b. Load p2 into t2 at l2_5.

c. Drive t2 to l2_1 (airport).

d. Unload p2 at l2_1.

e. Load p2 into a2.

f. Fly a2 to l1_1 (c1's airport).

g. Unload p2 at l1_1.

h. Now, to get p2 into t1 (which is at l1_1), load p2 into t1.

i. Drive t1 to l1_3.

j. Unload p2 at l1_3 (satisfies constraint4).

k. Then, drive t1 back to l1_1.

l. Load p2 into t1 again.

m. Drive to l1_1 (already there?), then unload p2.

Wait, no. After unloading at l1_3, to get p2 back to a1 for constraint3. Let's see. Maybe after step j, we need to load p2 back into t1, drive to l1_1, unload, then load into a1. Then fly a1 back to l2_1. But a1 is used for p1's transport. So perhaps after p1 is flown to l2_1, a1 can be used for p2.

But this is getting complicated. Let's think of the order of operations. Also, the constraints must be met in some state, not necessarily all at once.

Wait, the constraints:

1. p1 in a1 at some state.

2. If p1 is in a1 in state s, then p2 must be in t1 or t2 in s or later.

3. p2 in a1 or l1_2 at some state.

4. p2 in l1_3.

5. p2 in t1.

6. p1 in l2_3.

So, for constraint6, p1 must be in l2_3 at some point. l2_3 is in c2. So during p1's transportation from l2_1 to l2_6, perhaps we can route through l2_3. But how? If we use t2 to drive from l2_1 to l2_6, the path would be l2_1 -> l2_2 -> ... -> l2_6. But maybe l2_3 is on the way. But the problem doesn't specify the connectivity between locations. The drivetruck action allows moving between any two locations in the same city. So, perhaps t2 can drive directly from l2_1 to l2_3, then to l2_6. That would satisfy p1 being in l2_3.

So for p1's steps:

After flying to l2_1 (step6), unload into l2_1. Then, load into t2 (which is at l2_1 after step c and d). Then drive t2 to l2_3 (satisfying constraint6), unload p1 there, then load again into t2 and drive to l2_6. Wait, but the final goal is p1 in l2_6, so maybe after unloading in l2_3, we can reload and drive to l2_6. But that adds steps, making the plan longer. Since we need an optimal (shortest) plan, perhaps there's a way to have p1 pass through l2_3 without extra steps. But if the drive from l2_1 to l2_6 can go through l2_3, but the action allows moving directly between any two locations in the same city, maybe we can do it in two steps: l2_1 to l2_3, then l2_3 to l2_6. That way, p1 is in l2_3 during the plan. But that adds an extra driving step. Alternatively, if the drive from l2_1 to l2_6 can be done in one step, but then p1 isn't in l2_3. So we need to have a step where p1 is in l2_3. So perhaps after unloading p1 at l2_1, drive t2 to l2_3, unload p1 there (satisfying constraint6), then load again and drive to l2_6. But this adds steps. However, since the problem requires an optimal plan, maybe there's a way to do this more efficiently. Wait, but the initial position of t2 is l2_4. So steps for t2:

For p2:

a. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_5 (load p2).

b. Drive to l2_1 (airport), unload p2.

c. Load p2 into a2, fly to l1_1.

d. Unload p2 at l1_1.

e. Load into t1 (which is at l1_1 after step3).

Then drive t1 to l1_3, unload (satisfies constraint4 and 5).

Then drive back to l1_1, load p2 into a1, fly a1 to l2_1 (but a1 is in l2_1 after transporting p1). Wait, after step6, a1 is at l2_1. So if we fly a1 back to l1_1, then load p2 into a1, then fly back. But that adds more steps. Alternatively, use a2 again. But a2 is in l1_1 after flying p2 there. So after unloading p2 at l1_1 (stepd), a2 is there. So maybe fly a2 back to l2_1 with p2.

But this is getting too complex. Let's try to outline all steps, considering the constraints.

First, handle p1:

1. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_2. (drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_2 c1)
2. Load p1 into t1. (loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2)
3. Drive t1 to l1_1. (drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1)
4. Unload p1 at l1_1. (unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1)
5. Load p1 into a1. (loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1)
6. Fly a1 to l2_1. (flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1)
7. Unload p1 from a1. (unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1)
8. Now, need to get p1 to l2_6. So drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1. (drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2)
9. Load p1 into t2. (loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1)
10. Drive t2 to l2_3. (drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2) → This places p1 in l2_3 (constraint6)
11. Unload p1 at l2_3. (unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3)
12. Load p1 again into t2. (loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3)
13. Drive to l2_6. (drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_6 c2)
14. Unload p1. → Now p1 is in l2_6.

But this is 14 steps for p1. Maybe there's a shorter way. For example, after step7, p1 is in l2_1. If t2 is already in l2_1, then drive directly to l2_6. But in the initial state, t2 is in l2_4. So steps 8 is needed to get t2 to l2_1. Then step9, load, drive to l2_6. But that would not pass through l2_3. So to satisfy constraint6, we need to have a step where p1 is in l2_3. Hence, steps 10-13 are necessary. But that's a lot. Alternatively, can we drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_3, then to l2_6 in two steps. So steps 10 and 13. But that's still two steps. So p1 is in l2_3 during step10. But then, we have to unload there. Wait, if we drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_3, then to l2_6, but p1 is in t2 during the drive. So when t2 is at l2_3, p1 is in t2, which is in l2_3. But the constraint requires p1 to be in location l2_3. So to satisfy that, we need to unload p1 there. Because if it's in the truck at l2_3, the package's location is the truck, not the location. So to have p1 in l2_3, we have to unload it there. So steps 10-11 are needed. Then reload and proceed. So that's unavoidable.

Now for p2:

The initial location is l2_5. The goal is l2_1. So steps for p2:

a. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_5. (drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2)
b. Load p2 into t2. (loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5)
c. Drive t2 to l2_1. (drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2)
d. Unload p2 at l2_1. → Now p2 is at l2_1, which is the goal. But this can't be because we have to satisfy other constraints. Wait, but the goal is for p2 to be in l2_1. But the constraints require p2 to be in a1 or l1_2, in l1_3, and in t1. So this direct approach doesn't satisfy the constraints. Therefore, we need to take p2 to c1.

So alternative plan for p2:

a. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_5. (drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2)
b. Load p2 into t2. (loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5)
c. Drive t2 to l2_1. (drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2)
d. Unload p2 at l2_1. (unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1)
e. Load p2 into a2. (loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1)
f. Fly a2 to l1_1. (flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1)
g. Unload p2 at l1_1. (unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1)
h. Now, t1 is at l1_1 (after step3). Load p2 into t1. (loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1) → satisfies constraint5 (p2 in t1)
i. Drive t1 to l1_3. (drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1) 
j. Unload p2 at l1_3. (unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3) → satisfies constraint4
k. Now, need to get p2 back to l2_1. So load p2 into t1 again. (loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3)
l. Drive t1 to l1_1. (drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1)
m. Unload p2 at l1_1. (unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1)
n. Load p2 into a1. (loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1) → satisfies constraint3 (p2 in a1)
o. Fly a1 to l2_1. (flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1)
p. Unload p2 at l2_1. → goal achieved.

But this adds many steps. Also, note that constraint3 is satisfied when p2 is in a1 (stepn). Constraint4 is stepj. Constraint5 is steph. 

Now, the second constraint: when p1 is in a1 (step5), then p2 must be in t1 or t2 at that state or later. 

In step5, p1 is loaded into a1. At that time, where is p2? Let's see the timeline.

Assuming the steps are interleaved. For example, the steps for p1 and p2 may happen in parallel. But since we need a linear plan, we have to sequence them. Let's outline the combined steps.

Combined plan outline:

1. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_2 (c1) → p1's step1
2. Load p1 into t1 (p1 step2)
3. Drive t1 to l1_1 (p1 step3)
4. Unload p1 (p1 step4)
5. Load p1 into a1 (p1 step5) → now p1 is in a1 (constraint1)
   At this point, per constraint2, we need to ensure that p2 is in t1 or t2 now or later.
   Currently, p2 is in l2_5. So we need to start processing p2's steps.

But after step5, we can proceed with p2's steps. 

So after step5 (loading p1 into a1), we need to handle p2's movement to t1 or t2. Let's see:

6. Fly a1 to l2_1 (p1 step6)
7. Unload p1 (p1 step7)
8. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_5 (p2 stepa)
9. Load p2 into t2 (p2 stepb)
10. Drive t2 to l2_1 (p2 stepc)
11. Unload p2 (p2 stepd)
12. Load p2 into a2 (p2 stepe)
13. Fly a2 to l1_1 (p2 stepf)
14. Unload p2 (p2 stepg)
15. Load p2 into t1 (p2 steph) → satisfies constraint5
16. Drive t1 to l1_3 (p2 stepi)
17. Unload p2 (p2 stepj) → satisfies constraint4
18. Load p2 into t1 (p2 stepk)
19. Drive t1 to l1_1 (p2 stepl)
20. Unload p2 (p2 stepm)
21. Load p2 into a1 (p2 stepn) → satisfies constraint3 (p2 in a1)
22. Fly a1 to l2_1 (p2 stepo)
23. Unload p2 (p2 stepp) → goal achieved

Meanwhile, after step7 (p1 at l2_1), proceed with steps for p1:

24. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_3 (assuming t2 is at l2_1 after step10)
Wait, no. After step10, t2 is at l2_1 (after driving from l2_5). So after step11 (unload p2), t2 is at l2_1. So after step11, t2 is at l2_1. Then, in step24, drive t2 to l2_3 (to move p1):

Wait, but after step7, p1 is at l2_1. So steps for p1 continue:

After step7 (unload p1 at l2_1), need to load into t2 to move to l2_6. But t2 is at l2_1 after step10. So:

24. Load p1 into t2 (loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1)
25. Drive t2 to l2_3 (drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2)
26. Unload p1 (unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3) → satisfies constraint6
27. Load p1 into t2 again (loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3)
28. Drive t2 to l2_6
29. Unload p1 → goal achieved

But this adds even more steps. Now, let's check constraints:

- Constraint1: p1 in a1 at step5.

- Constraint2: when p1 is in a1 (step5), after that, p2 is loaded into t1 at step15. So the constraint is satisfied because p2 is in t1 later.

- Constraint3: p2 is in a1 at step21.

- Constraint4: p2 in l1_3 at step17.

- Constraint5: p2 in t1 at step15.

- Constraint6: p1 in l2_3 at step26.

But this plan is very long. Let's see if we can optimize. The problem requires an optimal plan with minimal steps. So perhaps there's a smarter way.

Alternative approach for p2:

Since p2's goal is l2_1, which is an airport. If we can load p2 into a2 in c2 and fly to l2_1, but that's where it's already located. Wait, no: initially, a2 is in l2_1. So p2 is in l2_5. So drive t2 to l2_5, load p2, drive to l2_1, unload. Then p2 is in l2_1. But that doesn't meet the other constraints. Because the constraints require p2 to be in a1, l1_2, l1_3, and t1. So this direct approach won't work. Hence, p2 must be transported to c1, then back.

But how to minimize steps. Let's try to interleave steps.

Let's try to handle p1 first:

1. Drive t1 to l1_2.
2. Load p1.
3. Drive to l1_1.
4. Unload.
5. Load into a1. → Now constraint1 is satisfied.
6. Fly a1 to l2_1.
7. Unload p1.

Now, p1 is in l2_1. To get to l2_6, need to use t2. But t2 is in l2_4 initially. So:

8. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
9. Load p1.
10. Drive t2 to l2_3 (satisfies constraint6 when unloaded)
11. Unload p1.
12. Load p1 again.
13. Drive to l2_6.
14. Unload.

For p2:

After step5 (when p1 is loaded into a1), we need to start handling p2 to meet constraint2. Since constraint2 says that if p1 is in a1, then p2 must be in t1/t2 now or later. So during or after step5, p2 must be loaded into t1 or t2.

So possible steps:

After step5 (load p1 into a1):

15. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_5.
16. Load p2 into t2. → Now p2 is in t2 (satisfies constraint2, since after step5, p2 is in t2 in step16)
17. Drive t2 to l2_1. → Now p2 is in l2_1, which is the goal. But we need to meet other constraints.

But according to the constraints, p2 must be in a1 or l1_2, in l1_3, and in t1. So this approach doesn't satisfy those. Hence, this direct approach for p2 won't work.

Alternative plan for p2:

After step5, load p2 into t2 (as above) and then fly p2 to c1.

So steps after step5:

15. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_5.
16. Load p2 into t2.
17. Drive t2 to l2_1.
18. Unload p2.
19. Load into a2.
20. Fly a2 to l1_1.
21. Unload p2.
22. Load into t1 (which is at l1_1 after step3).
23. Drive t1 to l1_3.
24. Unload p2 → satisfies constraint4.
25. Load p2 into t1 again.
26. Drive to l1_1.
27. Unload p2.
28. Load into a1.
29. Fly a1 to l2_1.
30. Unload p2 → goal.

But this adds many steps. Now, during this, constraint3 is met at step28 (p2 in a1), constraint5 at step22 (p2 in t1), constraint4 at step24.

But this plan has 30 steps, which seems too long. There must be a shorter way.

Wait, perhaps after loading p2 into t1 (step22), we can immediately load it into a1 and fly back. Let's see:

After step22: p2 is in t1 at l1_1.

23. Unload p2 into l1_1 → but why? To load into a1, it must be at l1_1.

24. Load p2 into a1. → satisfies constraint3 (p2 in a1).

25. Fly a1 to l2_1. → but a1 is already at l2_1 from step6. Wait, after step6, a1 is at l2_1. So to fly a1 back to l1_1, we need to fly it back. But that would require step6.5: fly a1 back to l1_1. But that would interfere with p1's transport. Because after step6, a1 is at l2_1, and p1 is there. So if we fly a1 back to l1_1, p1 would still be in l2_1 (unloaded). So this is possible.

But this complicates the plan. Let's try:

After step7 (p1 unloaded at l2_1), fly a1 back to l1_1. Then use a1 to carry p2 back. But this adds steps.

Alternative idea: use airplane a2 for p2. a2 is initially at l2_1. So after driving p2 to l2_1 (step17-18), load into a2, fly to l1_1. Then unload, load into t1, drive to l1_3, unload (constraint4), then drive back to l1_1, load into a2 again, fly to l2_1. But that would work.

Let's try:

For p2:

15. Drive t2 to l2_5.
16. Load p2.
17. Drive to l2_1.
18. Unload.
19. Load into a2.
20. Fly a2 to l1_1.
21. Unload p2.
22. Load into t1.
23. Drive t1 to l1_3.
24. Unload p2. → constraint4 met.
25. Drive t1 back to l1_1 (maybe not needed if we can load directly).
26. Load p2 into a2.
27. Fly a2 back to l2_1.
28. Unload p2. → goal.

This would be steps15-28. But integrating this into the main plan:

Main plan steps:

1. Drive t1 to l1_2.
2. Load p1.
3. Drive to l1_1.
4. Unload p1.
5. Load p1 into a1. → constraint1 met.
6. Fly a1 to l2_1.
7. Unload p1.
8. Drive t2 to l2_5.
9. Load p2 into t2.
10. Drive t2 to l2_1.
11. Unload p2.
12. Load p2 into a2.
13. Fly a2 to l1_1.
14. Unload p2.
15. Load p2 into t1. → constraint5 met.
16. Drive t1 to l1_3.
17. Unload p2. → constraint4 met.
18. Drive t1 back to l1_1.
19. Load p2 into a2.
20. Fly a2 to l2_1.
21. Unload p2. → goal for p2.

Now, for p1 after step7:

22. Drive t2 to l2_1 (already there after step10? No, step10 is driving t2 to l2_1. So after step10, t2 is at l2_1. So after step21, t2 is at l2_1 again. So:

22. Load p1 into t2.
23. Drive t2 to l2_3.
24. Unload p1. → constraint6 met.
25. Load p1 into t2.
26. Drive to l2_6.
27. Unload.

Total steps: 27. Still long, but perhaps this is necessary.

Now check constraints:

- constraint1: step5.

- constraint2: step5 (p1 in a1), after that, p2 is in t2 (step9) and later in t1 (step15). So satisfied.

- constraint3: p2 in a2 (step12) or l1_2. But a2 is an airplane, not a location. Wait, constraint3 says p2 must be in a1 or l1_2. In this plan, p2 is loaded into a2 (step12), which is not a1. So this doesn't satisfy constraint3. Oops, mistake here.

Ah, constraint3 requires p2 to be in a1 or l1_2. So using a2 won't help. So we need to get p2 into a1 or l1_2. 

So after flying p2 to l1_1 (step13), we can load into a1. But a1 is at l2_1 after step6. So unless we fly a1 back to l1_1, which adds steps. So perhaps:

After step6 (fly a1 to l2_1), we need to fly a1 back to l1_1 to carry p2. But that would require:

7. Fly a1 back to l1_1.

But then p1 is in l2_1 (unloaded), and a1 is back in l1_1. Then, after transporting p2 to l1_1 via a2, load p2 into a1.

But this adds steps. Let's adjust:

Main plan:

1. Drive t1 to l1_2.
2. Load p1.
3. Drive to l1_1.
4. Unload p1.
5. Load p1 into a1. → constraint1.
6. Fly a1 to l2_1.
7. Unload p1.
8. Fly a1 back to l1_1. → extra step.
9. Now a1 is at l1_1 again.

For p2:

10. Drive t2 to l2_5.
11. Load p2.
12. Drive to l2_1.
13. Unload.
14. Load into a2.
15. Fly a2 to l1_1.
16. Unload p2.
17. Load p2 into a1. → constraint3 met.
18. Fly a1 to l2_1.
19. Unload p2. → goal.

But then, after step18, a1 is at l2_1 again. But p1 is already there. But now p2 is in l2_1 via a1. This also requires steps for p1's transport to l2_6 and constraints for p2's other constraints.

Wait, this approach might not satisfy all constraints. For example, constraint4 (p2 in l1_3) and constraint5 (p2 in t1).

So to satisfy those, after step16 (p2 at l1_1), we need to load into t1, drive to l1_3.

So:

10. Drive t2 to l2_5.
11. Load p2.
12. Drive to l2_1.
13. Unload.
14. Load into a2.
15. Fly a2 to l1_1.
16. Unload p2.
17. Load into t1. → constraint5.
18. Drive t1 to l1_3. → constraint4.
19. Unload p2.
20. Drive t1 back to l1_1.
21. Load p2 into a1. → constraint3.
22. Fly a1 to l2_1.
23. Unload p2. → goal.

For p1:

After step7 (unload at l2_1):

24. Drive t2 (which is at l2_1 after step12) to l2_3.
25. Unload p1. → constraint6.
26. Load p1 into t2.
27. Drive to l2_6.
28. Unload.

This plan has 28 steps. Now check constraints:

- constraint1: step5.

- constraint2: after step5, p2 is loaded into t2 (step11), which is later. Satisfied.

- constraint3: step21 (p2 in a1).

- constraint4: step19 (p2 in l1_3).

- constraint5: step17 (p2 in t1).

- constraint6: step25 (p1 in l2_3).

This seems to satisfy all constraints. However, the plan is quite long. But given the constraints, it's necessary.

But perhaps there's a more optimal way. Let's see if we can combine some steps.

For example, after step5 (p1 loaded into a1), we fly a1 to l2_1 (step6), unload p1 (step7), then immediately fly a1 back to l1_1 (step8), which allows using a1 for p2.

Then, for p2:

Drive t2 to l2_5 (step9), load p2 (10), drive to l2_1 (11), unload (12), load into a1 (13), fly a1 to l1_1 (14). But wait, a1 is already at l1_1 from step8. So perhaps:

Wait, after step8, a1 is back at l1_1. So steps for p2:

9. Drive t2 to l2_5.
10. Load p2.
11. Drive to l2_1.
12. Unload.
13. Load into a1.
14. Fly a1 to l1_1. → but a1 is already there. So this is redundant. Hmm.

Alternatively, after step8 (a1 at l1_1), p2 can be loaded into a1 in l2_1, but that requires a1 to be there. So perhaps this approach isn't working.

Alternative idea: Use a2 to fly p2 to l1_1, then load into t1, drive to l1_3, unload, then load into a1 and fly back.

But to meet constraint3, p2 must be in a1 or l1_2. So when p2 is in a1, that's covered. So if we load p2 into a1 in l1_1, fly to l2_1, that works.

But the steps would be:

For p2:

1. Drive t2 to l2_5.
2. Load p2.
3. Drive to l2_1.
4. Unload.
5. Load into a2.
6. Fly to l1_1.
7. Unload.
8. Load into t1.
9. Drive to l1_3.
10. Unload.
11. Drive back to l1_1.
12. Load into a1.
13. Fly to l2_1.
14. Unload.

For p1:

1. Drive t1 to l1_2.
2. Load p1.
3. Drive to l1_1.
4. Unload.
5. Load into a1.
6. Fly to l2_1.
7. Unload.
8. Drive t2 (now in l2_1 after step3) to l2_3.
9. Unload p1.
10. Drive to l2_6.
11. Unload.

Now, combining these steps and ensuring the order:

Total steps:

1. Drive t1 l1_5 l1_2 c1
2. Loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
3. Drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
4. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
5. Loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
6. Flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
7. Unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
8. Drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2
9. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
10. Drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
11. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
12. Loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
13. Flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
14. Unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
15. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
16. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
17. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
18. Drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
19. Loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
20. Flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
21. Unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
22. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
23. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
24. Drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_6 c2
25. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_6

This plan has 25 steps. Let's check the constraints:

- constraint1: step5 (p1 in a1).

- constraint2: after step5, p2 is loaded into t2 (step9) and later into t1 (step15). Satisfied.

- constraint3: step19 (p2 in a1).

- constraint4: step17 (p2 in l1_3).

- constraint5: step15 (p2 in t1).

- constraint6: step22-23: after step22, t2 is at l2_3. Then step23 loads p1 into t2, which is in l2_3. So p1 is in t2 at l2_3. But the constraint requires p1 to be in location l2_3, not in a truck there. So need to unload p1 in l2_3. So between step22 and 23, we need to unload p1 there. So adjust steps:

After step7 (p1 in l2_1):

8. Drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2 (to get t2 to l2_1)
9. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
10. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
11. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 → satisfies constraint6
12. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
13. Drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_6 c2
14. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_6

Meanwhile, for p2:

15. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2 (wait, but t2 is already at l2_3 after step10. This is getting complicated. Maybe a different order.

Alternatively, after unloading p1 at l2_1 (step7), use t2 to move p1 to l2_3:

8. Drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
9. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
10. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
11. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 → constraint6 met
12. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
13. Drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_6 c2
14. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_6

For p2:

15. Drivetruck t2 l2_6 l2_5 c2 → wait, but t2 is at l2_6 after step13. This is not feasible. Hence, perhaps need another truck. But there's only t2 in c2. So this approach won't work. Hence, perhaps p2's steps must be handled by t2 before using it for p1.

So:

1. Handle p2 first using t2:

Steps for p2:

1. Drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2
2. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
3. Drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
4. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
5. Loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
6. Flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
7. Unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
8. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
9. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
10. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
11. Drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
12. Loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
13. Flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
14. Unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

For p1:

15. Drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_2 c1
16. Loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
17. Drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
18. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
19. Loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
20. Flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
21. Unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
22. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
23. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
24. Drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_6 c2
25. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_6

But now, in step19, loading p1 into a1 (which is at l1_1), but after step13, a1 is at l2_1. So there's a contradiction. Hence, this order won't work. 

This indicates that the steps need to be carefully interleaved to ensure that the airplanes and trucks are in the correct locations when needed. It's quite challenging to find an optimal plan that meets all constraints. 

After multiple attempts, the optimal plan likely involves:

1. Transport p1 to l2_6 via a1 and t2, ensuring it passes through l2_3.
2. Transport p2 to l2_1 via a2 and t1, meeting all constraints.
3. Sequence the steps such that when p1 is loaded into a1, p2 is either already in a truck or will be loaded later.

But given the time I've spent and the complexity, I think the plan I outlined earlier with 25 steps might be the minimal one, but perhaps there's a shorter way. 

Another observation: The fifth constraint requires p2 to be in t1. t1 is in c1. So p2 must be transported to c1. The fourth constraint requires p2 to be in l1_3. So p2 must be unloaded there. The third constraint requires p2 to be in a1 or l1_2. If we can arrange for p2 to be in a1 during its transport back to c2, that would satisfy it. 

Let me try one more time to outline a shorter plan:

Steps:

For p1:

1. Drive t1 to l1_2.
2. Load p1.
3. Drive to l1_1.
4. Unload.
5. Load into a1. → constraint1.
6. Fly to l2_1.
7. Unload p1.
8. Drive t2 to l2_1 (t2 starts at l2_4).
9. Load p1.
10. Drive to l2_3.
11. Unload p1. → constraint6.
12. Load p1.
13. Drive to l2_6.
14. Unload.

For p2:

15. Drive t2 to l2_5 (before step8).
But t2 is needed for p1's steps. So need to handle p2 first.

Alternative approach: handle p2's transport first to c1.

Steps:

1. Drive t2 to l2_5.
2. Load p2.
3. Drive to l2_1.
4. Unload.
5. Load into a2.
6. Fly to l1_1.
7. Unload.
8. Load into t1.
9. Drive to l1_3.
10. Unload. → constraint4.
11. Drive to l1_1.
12. Unload.
13. Load into a1. → constraint3.
14. Fly to l2_1.
15. Unload. → goal.

For p1:

16. Drive t1 to l1_2.
17. Load p1.
18. Drive to l1_1.
19. Unload.
20. Load into a1. → constraint1.
21. Fly to l2_1.
22. Unload.
23. Drive t2 to l2_1.
24. Load p1.
25. Drive to l2_3.
26. Unload. → constraint6.
27. Load p1.
28. Drive to l2_6.
29. Unload.

But this has 29 steps. Also, need to check that the constraints are met.

- constraint1: step20.

- constraint2: after step20, p2 is in a1 (step13) later. But step13 is before step20? No, because the steps for p2 are steps1-15, and p1's steps are 16-29. So step20 (loading p1 into a1) happens after step13 (loading p2 into a1). So when p1 is in a1 (step20), p2 was already in a1 (step13). But according to constraint2, if p1 is in a1 (step20), then p2 must be in t1 or t2 at that state or later. But p2 is in a1 at step13, which is before step20. So this violates constraint2. Hence, this approach won't work.

This is getting quite complex. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the initial plan that meets all the constraints, even if it's longer, as it's the only way to satisfy all the conditions.
