Okay, let's try to figure out this planning problem. So, the goal is to get package p1 to l1_1 and p2 to l2_6. But there are a bunch of constraints we need to satisfy along the way. Let me break this down step by step.

First, let's look at the initial state. The objects are spread across cities c1 and c2. 

For p1: It starts in l2_8, which is in city c2. The goal is to get it to l1_1, which is an airport in c1. Since airports are connected by airplanes, I think we'll need to use an airplane to transport p1 from c2 to c1. But first, we need to get p1 from l2_8 to the airport in c2, which is l2_1. How do we do that? Well, in city c2, there's a truck t2. Wait, looking back at the original state, "Package t1 is in location l1_4" and "Package t2 is in location l2_3". Wait, noâ€”wait, the original state says "Package t1 is in location l1_4"? Wait, no, the original state lists "Package t1" and "Package t2". Wait, that's a mistake, right? Because t1 and t2 are trucks, not packages. Oh, maybe that's a typo. Let me check again.

Wait, the original state says:

"Package t1 is in location l1_4"

"Package t2 is in location l2_3"

"Package p1 is in location l2_8"

"Package p2 is in location l1_7"

"Package a1 is in location l1_1"

"Package a2 is in location l2_1"

Wait, that can't be right. Because t1 and t2 are trucks, not packages. Similarly, a1 and a2 are airplanes. So the original state must have a typo. It should be:

"Truck t1 is in location l1_4"

"Truck t2 is in location l2_3"

"Airplane a1 is in location l1_1"

"Airplane a2 is in location l2_1"

And the packages are p1 and p2. So I think the user made a mistake in writing "Package t1" instead of "Truck t1". That makes sense, because otherwise, the problem is impossible. So I'll proceed under the assumption that those are trucks and airplanes, not packages.

So, initial positions:

- Trucks: t1 in l1_4 (c1), t2 in l2_3 (c2).

- Airplanes: a1 in l1_1 (c1's airport), a2 in l2_1 (c2's airport).

- Packages: p1 in l2_8 (c2), p2 in l1_7 (c1).

Goal: p1 in l1_1 (c1's airport), p2 in l2_6 (c2).

Constraints to satisfy:

1. At least one state where p1 is in a1 or p2 is in l2_7.

2. At least one state where p1 is in l2_8 (its initial position, so that's already true initially, but maybe needs to happen again? Wait, the problem says "must hold in at least one state", which could include the initial state. But maybe the plan needs to ensure that at some point, p1 is in l2_8 again. But since p1 starts there, maybe the initial state already satisfies that. But perhaps during the plan, p1 might be moved and then brought back. Need to check.

3. If p1 is in l2_8 at some state s, then either p2 is in l1_2 or p1 is in l2_5 must hold at s or later.

4. At least one state where p2 is in l2_8.

5. At least one state where p2 is in a2.

6. At least one state where p2 is in l1_8 or p1 is in l1_6.

So all these constraints must be satisfied during the plan.

Let me start by planning the movement for p1 and p2, considering the constraints.

First, for p1:

Starts at l2_8 (c2). Needs to go to l1_1 (c1). So the path would be: move p1 via truck in c2 to the airport (l2_1), load onto airplane a2, fly to l1_1, unload. Wait, but airplanes can fly between airports. So a2 is in l2_1 (c2's airport). So to get p1 to c1, we need to load it onto a2, fly a2 to l1_1 (c1's airport), then unload. But can a2 fly to another city's airport? Yes, because flyairplane can go between any airports. So that's possible.

But wait, p1 is in l2_8. How to get it to l2_1. In c2, the truck t2 is in l2_3. So need to drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_8, load p1 into t2, then drive t2 to l2_1, unload p1, load into a2, fly to l1_1, unload.

But wait, after flying a2 to l1_1, then p1 is there. So that's the plan for p1.

For p2: starts in l1_7 (c1). Needs to go to l2_6 (c2). So path: move via truck in c1 to airport l1_1, load into a1, fly to l2_1 (c2's airport), unload, load into truck t2 (but t2 is in c2, but initially in l2_3. Wait, after moving p2 to l2_1 via airplane, then need to get a truck in c2 to take it to l2_6. But t2 is in l2_3. So drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1, load p2, drive to l2_6, unload.

But let's check the steps:

For p2:

1. In c1, truck t1 is in l1_4. So need to drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_7 (where p2 is), load p2 into t1, drive t1 to l1_1 (airport), unload, load into a1, fly a1 to l2_1, unload, then use t2 in c2 to take p2 to l2_6.

But wait, t2 is in l2_3 initially. So after unloading p2 at l2_1 (airport in c2), we need to get t2 to l2_1. So drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1 (if possible). Then load p2 into t2, drive to l2_6, unload.

But let's structure this step by step.

Now, considering the constraints:

Constraint 2: p1 must be in l2_8 at some state. But p1 starts there, so unless we move it away and back, but that's inefficient. However, the initial state already has p1 in l2_8. So maybe that's sufficient. But the problem says "must hold in at least one state", which could be the initial state. So maybe we don't need to do anything here. But we need to check if the initial state counts. The problem says "a valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints". So if the initial state is considered part of the plan's states, then constraint 2 is already satisfied. But perhaps the constraints are about the states during the execution of the plan, including the initial state and all intermediate states. So the initial state has p1 in l2_8, so constraint 2 is already met. However, if the problem requires that during the plan's execution (i.e., after actions are taken), then maybe we need to have p1 back in l2_8. But that complicates things. Let's assume the initial state counts, so constraint 2 is satisfied. But let's check the other constraints.

Constraint 3: If in some state s, p1 is in l2_8, then either p2 is in l1_2 or p1 is in l2_5 must hold at s or after. Since the initial state s0 has p1 in l2_8, then we need to ensure that either p2 is in l1_2 or p1 is in l2_5 at s0 or later. But in s0, p2 is in l1_7, so not l1_2, and p1 is in l2_8, not l2_5. So we need to have, after the initial state, either p2 reaches l1_2 or p1 reaches l2_5 at some point.

But how? Because p1's path is from l2_8 to l2_1 (via truck) then to l1_1 (via airplane). So unless we take p1 to l2_5 first. Let's think. Maybe during moving p1 from l2_8 to l2_1, we can pass through l2_5? But trucks can only move within the same city. The truck t2 is in c2. So l2_8 is in c2. So to get p1 from l2_8 to l2_1, the truck can drive through various locations. Let me see the city c2's locations: l2_1 (airport), l2_2, l2_3, ..., up to l2_8. So the truck can drive from l2_8 to l2_1, but maybe via other locations. But the problem is that the initial position of t2 is l2_3, so to pick up p1 from l2_8, t2 needs to drive from l2_3 to l2_8. Then after loading p1, drive to l2_1. So maybe the path for t2 is l2_3 -> ... -> l2_8 (load p1), then drive to l2_1. But along the way, could they pass through l2_5? If the truck drives through l2_5 when going from l2_8 to l2_1, then when the truck is in l2_5, p1 is in the truck. But the constraint is that p1 is in location l2_5. So unless the truck unloads p1 there. But that would complicate the plan. Alternatively, maybe we can have t2 drive from l2_8 to l2_5, unload p1 there (so p1 is in l2_5), then load it again and proceed. But that adds steps. But this would satisfy constraint 3, because in the state where p1 is in l2_8 (initial), then later p1 is in l2_5. So that satisfies the implication. So perhaps we need to have p1 pass through l2_5.

Alternatively, we could have p2 go to l1_2. But p2 is initially in l1_7 (c1). So to get p2 to l1_2, we need to move it with truck t1. So maybe during the transportation of p2 to the airport, we can have a detour through l1_2. Let's see.

But let's outline the steps again, considering constraints.

For p1:

1. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_8 (c2).

2. Load p1 into t2 at l2_8.

3. Drive t2 from l2_8 to l2_5. (To satisfy constraint 3, since after the initial state, when p1 was in l2_8, we need p1 to be in l2_5 at some point.)

4. Unload p1 in l2_5. Now p1 is in l2_5. So this satisfies constraint 3. Then load p1 back into t2.

5. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1.

6. Unload p1 at l2_1.

7. Load p1 into a2.

8. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.

9. Unload p1 at l1_1. Done.

But this adds steps. However, if we don't do this, then constraint 3 would not be satisfied. Because in the initial state, p1 is in l2_8, but after that, we move it to l2_1, so unless during the transportation, the truck passes through l2_5 and unloads there, p1 is never in l2_5. Alternatively, maybe during the truck's movement from l2_8 to l2_1, it passes through l2_5, but if the truck is in l2_5 with p1 inside, then p1 is in the truck, not in the location. So that doesn't count. So to have p1 in l2_5, we need to unload it there. So steps 3-5 would be:

3. Drive t2 from l2_8 to l2_5.

4. Unload p1 at l2_5.

5. Load p1 into t2 again.

6. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1.

But this adds two extra steps (unload and load). Alternatively, perhaps we can have p2 go to l1_2. Let's check p2's path.

For p2:

1. In l1_7 (c1). Need to get to l2_6 (c2).

So steps:

- Use truck t1 (in l1_4) to drive to l1_7, load p2, drive to l1_1 (airport), unload.

- Load into airplane a1, fly to l2_1 (c2's airport).

- Unload, then use truck t2 (if available) to drive to l2_1, load p2, drive to l2_6, unload.

But during this process, perhaps when moving p2 in c1, we can drive t1 through l1_2. So:

- Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_7 (load p2).

- Then drive t1 from l1_7 to l1_2 (unload p2 there, then load again). But that's adding steps. But this would make p2 be in l1_2 at some point, satisfying the other part of constraint 3.

So for constraint 3, if we have p2 in l1_2 during the plan, then when p1 is in l2_8 (initially), the constraint is satisfied because p2 is in l1_2 at some state after the initial state.

So perhaps that's a better way. Let's think.

If we arrange for p2 to be in l1_2 during its transportation, then constraint 3 is satisfied. Because the initial state has p1 in l2_8, and later p2 is in l1_2. So that meets the requirement.

So for p2:

1. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_7 (load p2).

2. Drive t1 from l1_7 to l1_2 (unload p2 here? Or just pass through? Wait, to have p2 in l1_2, we need to unload it there. So:

- Drive t1 to l1_7, load p2.

- Drive t1 to l1_2, unload p2. Now p2 is in l1_2. Then load p2 again into t1.

- Drive t1 to l1_1, unload, load into a1, fly to l2_1, etc.

This way, p2 is in l1_2 at some state, satisfying the condition for constraint 3. Because the initial state s0 has p1 in l2_8, and in a later state, p2 is in l1_2, which satisfies the implication of constraint 3.

This seems better than detouring p1 to l2_5, which adds more steps.

So, incorporating this into the plan:

For p2:

- Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_7 (action: drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_7 c1)

- Load p2 into t1 at l1_7 (loadtruck p2 t1 l1_7)

- Drive t1 from l1_7 to l1_2 (drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_2 c1)

- Unload p2 at l1_2 (unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2) â†’ now p2 is in l1_2, satisfying constraint 3's condition.

- Then load p2 back into t1 (loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2)

- Drive t1 to l1_1 (drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1)

- Unload p2 (unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1)

- Load into a1 (loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1)

- Fly a1 to l2_1 (flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1)

- Unload p2 (unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1)

- Now, need to get p2 to l2_6. But truck t2 is initially in l2_3. So:

- Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1 (drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2)

- Load p2 into t2 (loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1)

- Drive t2 to l2_6 (drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_6 c2)

- Unload p2 (unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_6)

But this adds steps for p2, but ensures that constraint 3 is met.

Now, checking other constraints:

Constraint 1: At least one state where p1 is in a1 or p2 is in l2_7.

Looking at the plan so far, when does p2 reach l2_7? Maybe not. So perhaps we need to have p2 in l2_7 at some point. Alternatively, have p1 in a1. Let's see.

In the plan for p1, after being loaded into a2 and flown to l1_1, p1 is in a1? No, a2 is the airplane. Wait, a1 is in l1_1 initially, and a2 is in l2_1. So for p1's journey:

p1 is in l2_8 â†’ loaded into t2 (after driving t2 to l2_8), then driven to l2_1, unloaded, loaded into a2, flown to l1_1, unloaded. So p1 is in a2 during the flight. So when it's loaded into a2, that's the state where p1 is in a2. But constraint 1 requires p1 to be in a1 or p2 in l2_7. So this doesn't satisfy it. So we need to arrange for one of these.

Option: Have p2 pass through l2_7. Since p2 is being transported from l2_1 to l2_6 via truck t2. So the path from l2_1 to l2_6 in c2 may go through l2_7. If the truck drives from l2_1 to l2_7, then to l2_6. Then when p2 is in l2_7 (unloaded or in truck?), but to satisfy the constraint, p2 needs to be in location l2_7. So perhaps drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_7, unload p2 there, then load again and drive to l2_6. But that adds steps. Alternatively, if the truck is passing through l2_7 while carrying p2, then p2 is in the truck, not in the location. So that doesn't count. So to have p2 in l2_7, we need to unload it there.

But that would complicate the plan. Alternatively, find another way.

Alternatively, have p1 loaded into a1. But a1 is in c1's airport. To get p1 into a1, we need to fly a1 to c2, load p1, but that's not efficient. Alternatively, perhaps when moving p1 to c1's airport, load it into a1. Wait, after flying a2 to l1_1, unload p1 there. Then, if we load p1 into a1 (which is already at l1_1), but why? The goal is to have p1 in l1_1, so unloading it there is sufficient. But if we load it into a1, then unload again, that would satisfy the constraint. For example:

After unloading p1 from a2 into l1_1, then load it into a1 (which is at l1_1), then unload again. That would make p1 be in a1 at some point. So adding:

10. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

11. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

But steps 10 and 11 are redundant since the goal is to have p1 in l1_1. But this would satisfy constraint 1, as p1 is in a1 during step 10-11. However, this adds two steps. But the problem requires an optimal plan (shortest possible). So maybe there's a better way.

Alternatively, during p2's transportation, drive t2 through l2_7. For example:

After loading p2 into t2 at l2_1, drive t2 to l2_7, unload p2 there (so p2 is in l2_7), then load again and drive to l2_6. This would satisfy constraint 1 (p2 in l2_7) and add two steps (unload and load). But this also satisfies constraint 1.

So for p2's part in c2:

- After unloading from a2 at l2_1:

- Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1 (wait, initial position of t2 is l2_3. So earlier steps for p1 required t2 to be driven to l2_8, then to l2_1. But in the p2 plan, after flying to l2_1, we need t2 to be available in l2_1. But t2 was used for transporting p1. Wait, this is a problem. Because t2 is used to move p1 from l2_8 to l2_1. Then, after that, t2 is in l2_1. So when p2 arrives at l2_1 via airplane, t2 is already there. So steps for p1 and p2 may interfere.

Wait, let's outline the entire plan step by step, considering both packages and the use of trucks and airplanes.

Plan for p1:

1. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_8 (drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_8 c2)

2. Load p1 into t2 at l2_8 (loadtruck p1 t2 l2_8)

3. Drive t2 from l2_8 to l2_1 (drivetruck t2 l2_8 l2_1 c2)

4. Unload p1 at l2_1 (unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1)

5. Load p1 into a2 (loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1)

6. Fly a2 to l1_1 (flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1)

7. Unload p1 at l1_1 (unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1) â†’ goal achieved for p1.

Plan for p2:

8. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_7 (drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_7 c1)

9. Load p2 into t1 at l1_7 (loadtruck p2 t1 l1_7)

10. Drive t1 from l1_7 to l1_2 (drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_2 c1)

11. Unload p2 at l1_2 (unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2) â†’ satisfies constraint 3

12. Load p2 back into t1 (loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2)

13. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1 (drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1)

14. Unload p2 at l1_1 (unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1)

15. Load p2 into a1 (loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1)

16. Fly a1 to l2_1 (flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1)

17. Unload p2 at l2_1 (unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1)

18. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_7 (drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_7 c2) â†’ to satisfy constraint 1 (p2 in l2_7)

19. Load p2 into t2 at l2_7 (loadtruck p2 t2 l2_7) â†’ no, to have p2 in l2_7, we need to unload it there.

Wait, steps 18-20:

18. Drive t2 (which is at l2_1 after step 3) to l2_7.

19. Unload p2 at l2_7 (but p2 is still in the airplane at l2_1 until step 17. Then after unloading, p2 is at l2_1. So need to load into t2 at l2_1, drive to l2_7, unload.

So:

17. Unload p2 at l2_1 (now p2 is in l2_1)

18. Load p2 into t2 at l2_1 (loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1)

19. Drive t2 to l2_7 (drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_7 c2)

20. Unload p2 at l2_7 (unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_7) â†’ constraint 1 satisfied here.

21. Load p2 back into t2 (loadtruck p2 t2 l2_7)

22. Drive t2 to l2_6 (drivetruck t2 l2_7 l2_6 c2)

23. Unload p2 at l2_6 â†’ goal achieved.

But this adds several steps. However, it satisfies constraint 1 (p2 in l2_7) and constraint 3 (p2 in l1_2). Also, we need to check other constraints.

Constraint 4: p2 must be in l2_8 at some state. Initially, p2 is in l1_7, so we need to move p2 to l2_8. How? Maybe during the transportation in c2. But l2_8 is in c2. So after flying to l2_1, can we drive t2 to l2_8, unload p2 there, then proceed? Let's see:

After step 17 (p2 in l2_1):

- Load p2 into t2 (l2_1)

- Drive t2 to l2_8 (drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_8 c2)

- Unload p2 (now in l2_8 â†’ satisfies constraint 4)

- Load back into t2

- Drive to l2_7, unload (constraint 1), then to l2_6.

But this adds more steps. So steps would be:

17. Unload p2 at l2_1.

18. Load into t2.

19. Drive to l2_8.

20. Unload p2 (constraint 4 met).

21. Load into t2 again.

22. Drive to l2_7.

23. Unload (constraint 1 met).

24. Load again.

25. Drive to l2_6.

26. Unload.

This is getting too long. But maybe there's a more optimal way.

Alternatively, after step 17 (p2 in l2_1), we can drive t2 to l2_8, unload (constraint 4), then drive to l2_7, unload (constraint 1), then to l2_6. Let's see:

17. Unload p2 at l2_1.

18. Load into t2.

19. Drive to l2_8.

20. Unload p2 â†’ constraint 4.

21. Load into t2.

22. Drive to l2_7.

23. Unload â†’ constraint 1.

24. Load into t2.

25. Drive to l2_6.

26. Unload.

This way, constraints 1 and 4 are met. However, this adds multiple steps. But the problem requires the plan to be optimal (shortest possible). So maybe there's a smarter way.

Another approach: Find overlapping constraints.

Constraint 5: p2 must be in a2 at some state. a2 is in l2_1 (initially). So to get p2 into a2, we need to load it into a2. But p2 is transported via a1 to l2_1, so unless we load it into a2 after arriving in l2_1. For example:

After step 17 (p2 in l2_1):

- Load p2 into a2 (loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1) â†’ now p2 is in a2 (satisfies constraint 5)

- Then unload from a2 (unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1)

- Then load into t2 and proceed.

But this adds two steps but satisfies constraint 5.

Alternatively, when flying p2 to l2_1, use a2 instead of a1. But a1 is in c1's airport, and a2 is in c2's airport. So to fly p2 from c1 to c2, we need to use a1 (since a1 is in c1's airport). Wait, no. Airplanes can fly between any airports. So to transport p2 from c1 to c2, we can use either airplane. But a1 is already in l1_1 (c1), and a2 is in l2_1 (c2). So to fly from l1_1 to l2_1, a1 can do that. Or a2 can fly to l1_1, load p2, then fly back. But that would be more steps.

Alternatively, perhaps use a2 to transport p2. But initially, a2 is in l2_1. So to get a2 to l1_1 to pick up p2:

- Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.

- Load p2 into a2.

- Fly back to l2_1.

But this requires:

For p2:

After getting p2 to l1_1 (steps 8-14):

15. Load into a2 (but a2 is in l2_1, so need to fly it to l1_1 first.

So steps:

14. Unload p2 at l1_1.

15. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.

16. Load p2 into a2.

17. Fly a2 back to l2_1.

18. Unload p2.

This way, p2 is in a2 (step 16-17), satisfying constraint 5. Then proceed to load into t2 and drive to l2_6. But this adds several steps. But this might be necessary.

But this seems inefficient. Let me think again.

Alternatively, after p2 is unloaded at l2_1 (step 17), we can load it into a2 (which is at l2_1), then immediately unload it. This would satisfy constraint 5 (p2 in a2). So:

17. Unload p2 from a1 into l2_1.

18. Load p2 into a2 (loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1) â†’ now p2 is in a2.

19. Unload p2 from a2 (unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1).

Then proceed to load into t2 and drive to l2_6. This adds two steps but satisfies constraint 5.

Now, let's compile all the necessary steps, ensuring all constraints are met.

Constraints:

1. At least one state where p1 is in a1 or p2 is in l2_7 â†’ we'll choose p2 in l2_7.

2. p1 in l2_8 â†’ initial state.

3. If p1 in l2_8 (which happens in the initial state), then p2 in l1_2 or p1 in l2_5 â†’ we have p2 in l1_2 during step 11.

4. p2 in l2_8 â†’ need to get p2 there.

5. p2 in a2 â†’ achieved by loading into a2 at l2_1.

6. p2 in l1_8 or p1 in l1_6 â†’ need to satisfy this. Let's see.

Currently, p1's path is to l1_1, so it doesn't go through l1_6. p2's path in c1 is from l1_7 to l1_2 to l1_1. So neither p2 in l1_8 nor p1 in l1_6. So we need to arrange for one of these.

Option: Have p2 go to l1_8 during its transportation. For example:

After step 10 (p2 loaded into t1 at l1_7), drive t1 to l1_8, unload, then reload and proceed to l1_2. This would satisfy constraint 6.

But this adds steps. Let's see:

Modify p2's steps in c1:

8. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_7.

9. Load p2 into t1.

10. Drive t1 to l1_8.

11. Unload p2 â†’ now in l1_8 (satisfies constraint 6).

12. Load p2 back into t1.

13. Drive to l1_2.

14. Unload p2 â†’ satisfies constraint 3.

Then proceed as before.

This adds steps but satisfies constraint 6.

Alternatively, have p1 go to l1_6. But p1 is in c2 and needs to get to l1_1. To have p1 in l1_6, which is in c1, but p1 is transported via airplane to l1_1. So unless the airplane unloads p1 at l1_6, which isn't possible since airplanes can only land at airports. So l1_6 is not an airport. So p1 can't be in l1_6 unless moved there by truck. But p1 is in l1_1 (airport), which is in c1. So after unloading at l1_1, use truck t1 to move to l1_6, but that's against the goal. So that's not feasible.

Thus, the only way to satisfy constraint 6 is to have p2 in l1_8 at some point. So modifying the plan to include that.

So steps for p2 in c1:

8. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_7.

9. Load p2 into t1.

10. Drive t1 to l1_8 (drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_8 c1)

11. Unload p2 â†’ now in l1_8 (constraint 6).

12. Load p2 back into t1.

13. Drive to l1_2.

14. Unload p2 â†’ constraint 3.

15. Load back into t1.

16. Drive to l1_1.

17. Unload.

18. Load into a1.

19. Fly to l2_1.

20. Unload.

21. Load into a2 (step to satisfy constraint 5).

22. Unload from a2.

23. Load into t2.

24. Drive to l2_8 (constraint 4).

25. Unload.

26. Load back into t2.

27. Drive to l2_7 (constraint 1).

28. Unload.

29. Load back into t2.

30. Drive to l2_6.

31. Unload.

This plan is getting very long. But we need to make sure all constraints are met.

Now, let's check all constraints:

1. p2 in l2_7 â†’ yes, step 28.

2. p1 in l2_8 â†’ initial state.

3. If p1 in l2_8 (initial), then p2 in l1_2 (step 14) â†’ satisfied.

4. p2 in l2_8 â†’ step 25.

5. p2 in a2 â†’ step 21.

6. p2 in l1_8 â†’ step 11.

All constraints are met.

But the plan length is quite long. Is there a more optimal way?

Let me try to find a shorter path.

Alternative approach for constraint 6: Have p2 pass through l1_8 during transportation. For example, when moving from l1_7 to l1_1, could the truck pass through l1_8? But the truck can move between any locations in the city. So maybe the optimal path is l1_7 â†’ l1_8 â†’ l1_1, but unloading at l1_8. But the goal is to get p2 to l1_1, so unloading at l1_8 would require reloading. But this would add steps. But maybe:

Drive t1 from l1_7 to l1_8, unload p2 (constraint 6), then load and drive to l1_1.

But that's two steps instead of driving directly. But maybe that's necessary.

Similarly, for constraint 4 (p2 in l2_8), after arriving in c2, drive t2 to l2_8, unload, then to l2_6.

But maybe combining some steps.

Let's attempt a more optimized plan:

For p1:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_8 c2

2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_8

3. drivetruck t2 l2_8 l2_1 c2

4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

5. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

6. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

7. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 â†’ p1 done.

For p2:

8. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_7 c1

9. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_7

10. drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_8 c1

11. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_8 â†’ constraint 6

12. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_8

13. drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_2 c1

14. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 â†’ constraint 3

15. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

16. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1

17. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

18. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

19. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

20. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

21. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 â†’ now in a2 (constraint 5)

22. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

23. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

24. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_8 c2

25. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_8 â†’ constraint 4

26. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_8

27. drivetruck t2 l2_8 l2_7 c2

28. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_7 â†’ constraint 1

29. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_7

30. drivetruck t2 l2_7 l2_6 c2

31. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_6 â†’ goal.

This plan has 31 steps. But perhaps some steps can be optimized.

Wait, after step 20, p2 is at l2_1. To get into a2, we load it (step 21) and unload (step 22). Then load into t2 (step23). But steps 21-22 can be merged if we don't need to fly a2. However, to have p2 in a2, we need to load it into a2. So steps 21 and 22 are necessary.

Alternatively, could we load p2 into a2 directly from the airplane a1? No, because a1 is at l2_1, but a2 is also at l2_1 (after step 6, a2 is at l1_1, then after flying back? Wait, no. Let's check airplane locations.

After step 6, a2 flies from l2_1 to l1_1. So after step 6, a2 is at l1_1. Then, when transporting p2, we use a1 to fly from l1_1 to l2_1 (step 19). So a1 is now at l2_1. To get a2 back to l2_1, we need to fly it from l1_1 to l2_1. But that's an additional step. So:

After step 7 (a2 at l1_1), to use a2 for p2's transportation:

- Fly a2 back to l2_1.

But this would require:

8. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1

Then, load p2 into a2 at l2_1.

But this is adding steps. It might be more efficient to use a1 for p2's flight and a2 for p1's flight.

Alternatively, perhaps use a2 for both. But that would require moving a2 back and forth.

This is getting very complicated. Let's try to find the minimal steps.

Alternative plan focusing on the constraints:

For p1:

1. Drive t2 to l2_8, load p1.

2. Drive to l2_1, unload.

3. Load into a2, fly to l1_1, unload. (steps 1-3 for p1)

For p2:

4. Drive t1 to l1_7, load p2.

5. Drive to l1_8, unload (constraint 6).

6. Load, drive to l1_2, unload (constraint 3).

7. Load, drive to l1_1, unload.

8. Load into a1, fly to l2_1, unload.

9. Load into a2 (constraint 5), unload.

10. Load into t2, drive to l2_8 (constraint 4), unload.

11. Load, drive to l2_7, unload (constraint 1).

12. Load, drive to l2_6, unload.

This results in 12 actions for p2 and 3 for p1, total 15. But need to include all steps.

Wait, let's count each action:

p1:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_8 c2

2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_8

3. drivetruck t2 l2_8 l2_1 c2

4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

5. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

6. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

7. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 â†’ 7 steps.

p2:

8. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_7 c1

9. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_7

10. drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_8 c1

11. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_8 â†’ constraint 6

12. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_8

13. drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_2 c1

14. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 â†’ constraint 3

15. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

16. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1

17. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

18. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

19. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

20. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

21. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 â†’ constraint 5

22. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

23. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

24. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_8 c2

25. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_8 â†’ constraint 4

26. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_8

27. drivetruck t2 l2_8 l2_7 c2

28. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_7 â†’ constraint 1

29. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_7

30. drivetruck t2 l2_7 l2_6 c2

31. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_6 â†’ 24 steps.

But this is 31 actions. However, the problem requires an optimal plan with minimal steps. This seems too long. Let's see if we can find overlaps or reuse actions.

Wait, after p1 is delivered, can we use the same trucks/airplanes for p2?

For example, after step 7 (p1 at l1_1), airplane a2 is at l1_1. Can we use a2 to transport p2 back to c2? But p2 needs to go from c1 to c2. So:

Instead of using a1 to fly p2 to l2_1, perhaps use a2. But a2 is in l1_1 after step 7.

So steps for p2:

After step 7:

8. In c1, drive t1 to l1_7, load p2.

9. Drive to l1_8, unload (constraint 6).

10. Load, drive to l1_2, unload (constraint 3).

11. Load, drive to l1_1, unload.

12. Load into a2 (which is at l1_1), fly to l2_1.

13. Unload p2 â†’ now p2 is in l2_1.

14. Load into t2, drive to l2_8 (constraint 4), unload.

15. Load, drive to l2_7 (constraint 1), unload.

16. Load, drive to l2_6, unload.

This way, we use a2 for p2's flight, saving steps.

So revised plan:

p1:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_8 c2

2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_8

3. drivetruck t2 l2_8 l2_1 c2

4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

5. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

6. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

7. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 â†’ p1 done.

p2:

8. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_7 c1

9. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_7

10. drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_8 c1

11. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_8 â†’ constraint 6

12. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_8

13. drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_2 c1

14. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 â†’ constraint 3

15. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

16. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1

17. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

18. loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

19. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1

20. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 â†’ now p2 in a2 (constraint 5)

21. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

22. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_8 c2

23. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_8 â†’ constraint 4

24. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_8

25. drivetruck t2 l2_8 l2_7 c2

26. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_7 â†’ constraint 1

27. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_7

28. drivetruck t2 l2_7 l2_6 c2

29. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_6 â†’ goal.

This is 29 steps. But we can see that step 20 unloads p2 from a2, which was loaded in step 18. So step 20 ensures p2 is in a2 (constraint 5). Steps 23 and 26 handle constraints 4 and 1.

This plan satisfies all constraints and has 29 steps. But is there a way to make it shorter?

For example, after step 23 (p2 in l2_8), can we drive directly to l2_6, passing through l2_7 and unload there?

But l2_8 to l2_6 may not go through l2_7. Depending on the city layout. But since the problem doesn't specify connectivity between locations, we can assume trucks can drive directly between any locations in the same city. So perhaps from l2_8 to l2_6 directly, but we need to go through l2_7 to satisfy constraint 1. Alternatively, if we can unload in l2_7 while passing through, but we can't.

Alternatively, combine steps:

After step 23 (p2 in l2_8), drive to l2_7, unload (constraint 1), then to l2_6.

So:

23. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_8 â†’ constraint 4.

24. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_8

25. drivetruck t2 l2_8 l2_7 c2

26. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_7 â†’ constraint 1.

27. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_7

28. drivetruck t2 l2_7 l2_6 c2

29. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_6 â†’ total steps for p2: 22 actions (steps 8-29), total plan steps 29.

Still 29 steps.

Is there any way to reduce steps?

Looking at p2's steps in c1:

- Steps 8-17 involve moving p2 from l1_7 to l1_8 to l1_2 to l1_1. This is to satisfy constraints 6 and 3. Can these be combined?

For example:

After loading p2 at l1_7 (step 9), drive to l1_8 (unload, step 11), then drive to l1_2 (unload, step 14), then to l1_1. This is necessary to hit both l1_8 and l1_2.

Alternatively, find a route that covers both in fewer steps. But given the locations, maybe it's unavoidable.

Another optimization: After unloading p2 at l1_8 (step 11), instead of loading back into t1 and driving to l1_2, perhaps have another truck. But there's only t1 in c1.

So no, must use t1.

Thus, it's necessary to have these steps.

Similarly, in c2, after p2 arrives at l2_1, steps to load into t2, drive to l2_8, then l2_7, then l2_6 are necessary for constraints.

This seems to be the minimal plan. However, I might have missed a more optimal path. For example, when moving p2 from l2_8 to l2_6, perhaps l2_8 to l2_6 is possible without going through l2_7, but we need to visit l2_7 to satisfy constraint 1. So that's unavoidable.

Alternatively, can we satisfy constraint 1 by having p1 in a1? But p1 is transported via a2. So unless we load p1 into a1 at some point.

But p1 is in l1_1 (goal), so after arriving there, we could load it into a1 (which is at l1_1), then unload. This would satisfy constraint 1 (p1 in a1). This adds two steps but might save steps elsewhere.

So modifying p1's plan:

7. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

8. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 â†’ p1 in a1 (constraint 1)

9. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 â†’ p1 back in goal location.

This adds two steps but allows us to skip driving p2 to l2_7. But let's see:

If we do this, then constraint 1 is satisfied by p1 in a1, so we don't need to have p2 in l2_7. This could save steps in p2's part.

So revised plan:

p1:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_8 c2

2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_8

3. drivetruck t2 l2_8 l2_1 c2

4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

5. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

6. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

7. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

8. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 â†’ constraint 1

9. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

p2's steps:

10. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_7 c1

11. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_7

12. drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_8 c1

13. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_8 â†’ constraint 6

14. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_8

15. drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_2 c1

16. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 â†’ constraint 3

17. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

18. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1

19. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

20. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

21. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

22. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

23. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 â†’ constraint 5

24. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

25. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

26. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_8 c2

27. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_8 â†’ constraint 4

28. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_8

29. drivetruck t2 l2_8 l2_6 c2

30. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_6 â†’ goal.

This plan has 30 steps, but by satisfying constraint 1 via p1 in a1 (steps 8-9), we avoid the need to drive to l2_7. However, we added two steps for p1 and saved three steps for p2 (removing the l2_7 part). Net steps: 30 vs previous 29. Not better.

Alternatively, perhaps this approach is not optimal.

Another idea: Use a2 to transport both p1 and p2. After delivering p1 to l1_1, fly a2 back to l2_1, then use it for p2. But this adds steps for a2's movement.

Alternatively, use a1 to transport p2 and a2 for p1. Then, after a1 delivers p2 to l2_1, we can load p2 into a2 (which is at l1_1) by first flying a2 back, but that's too many steps.

Overall, it seems the initial plan with 29 steps is the minimal possible given the constraints. However, I might have missed a more optimal sequence. For example, combining the loading and unloading steps where possible.

Final plan:

```
drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_8 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_8
drivetruck t2 l2_8 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_7 c1
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_7
drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_8 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_8
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_8
drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_2 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1

drivetruck t2 l2_8 l2_7 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_7
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_7
drivetruck t2 l2_7 l2_6 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_6
```

But let's count the steps:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_8 c2

2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_8

3. drivetruck t2 l2_8 l2_1 c2

4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

5. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

6. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

7. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

8. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_7 c1

9. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_7

10. drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_8 c1

11. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_8

12. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_8

13. drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_2 c1

14. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

15. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

16. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1

17. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

18. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

19. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

20. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

21. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

22. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

23. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

24. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_8 c2

25. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_8

26. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_8

27. drivetruck t2 l2_8 l2_7 c2

28. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_7

29. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_7

30. drivetruck t2 l2_7 l2_6 c2

31. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_6

This is 31 steps. However, I might have missed some optimization. For example, after step 24, t2 is at l2_8, so steps 24-27 could be merged if possible.

Alternatively, perhaps some steps can be reordered. But given the constraints, this seems necessary. Therefore, the optimal plan likely involves these steps to satisfy all constraints.
