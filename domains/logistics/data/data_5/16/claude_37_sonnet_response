Let's break down the problem:

1. We have two cities, c1 and c2, each with 8 locations.
2. l1_1 is an airport in city c1, and l2_1 is an airport in city c2.
3. We have two trucks, t1 and t2, and two airplanes, a1 and a2.
4. We have two packages, p1 and p2. Initially:
   - p1 is in location l2_8 (city c2)
   - p2 is in location l1_7 (city c1)
   - t1 is in location l1_4 (city c1)
   - t2 is in location l2_3 (city c2)
   - a1 is in location l1_1 (city c1's airport)
   - a2 is in location l2_1 (city c2's airport)
5. We need to have:
   - p1 in location l1_1 (city c1's airport)
   - p2 in location l2_6 (city c2)

Additionally, we have constraints that must be met at some point during the execution of our plan:

1. Either p1 is in a1 or p2 is in location l2_7.
2. p1 is in location l2_8.
3. If p1 is in location l2_8, then either p2 is in location l1_2 or p1 is in location l2_5.
4. p2 is in location l2_8.
5. p2 is in a2.
6. Either p2 is in location l1_8 or p1 is in location l1_6.

Let's start by trying to outline a plan that satisfies the goals and constraints. Given the initial state, some of the constraints are already satisfied:

- p1 is already in location l2_8, so constraint 2 is satisfied.
- However, constraint 3 states that if p1 is in location l2_8, then either p2 is in location l1_2 or p1 is in location l2_5. Currently, p1 is in l2_8 and p2 is in l1_7, which means we need to move either p2 to l1_2 or p1 to l2_5 to satisfy this constraint.

Let's draft a general plan:

1. Move p1 from l2_8 to l1_1 (final goal).
2. Move p2 from l1_7 to l2_6 (final goal).
3. Satisfy all constraints along the way.

Now, let's break it down further:

For p1 (from l2_8 to l1_1):
1. Use t2 to transport p1 from l2_8 to l2_1 (airport).
2. Load p1 onto a2 (satisfying constraint 5).
3. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
4. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1.

For p2 (from l1_7 to l2_6):
1. Use t1 to transport p2 from l1_7 to l1_1 (airport).
2. Load p2 onto a1 (satisfying constraint 1, p1 is in a1).
3. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
4. Unload p2 from a1 at l2_1.
5. Use t2 to transport p2 from l2_1 to l2_6.

Wait, let me check. We also need to satisfy:
- p2 is in location l2_8 (constraint 4).
- Either p2 is in location l1_8 or p1 is in location l1_6 (constraint 6).

Let's revise the plan to account for these constraints:

For p1 (from l2_8 to l1_1):
1. Initially, p1 is in l2_8, which satisfies constraint 2.
2. Given constraint 3, we need to move p1 to l2_5 since p2 is not in l1_2.
3. Use t2 to transport p1 from l2_8 to l2_5.
4. Continue using t2 to transport p1 from l2_5 to l2_1 (airport).
5. Load p1 onto a1.
6. Fly a1 from l2_1 to l1_1.
7. Unload p1 from a1 at l1_1.

For p2 (from l1_7 to l2_6):
1. Use t1 to transport p2 from l1_7 to l1_8 (satisfying part of constraint 6).
2. Use t1 to transport p2 from l1_8 to l1_1 (airport).
3. Load p2 onto a2.
4. Fly a2 from l1_1 to l2_1.
5. Unload p2 from a2 at l2_1 (satisfying constraint 5).
6. Use t2 to transport p2 from l2_1 to l2_8 (satisfying constraint 4).
7. Use t2 to transport p2 from l2_8 to l2_7 (satisfying constraint 1).
8. Use t2 to transport p2 from l2_7 to l2_6 (final goal).

Ok, I realize I made a mistake. Let me re-read the initial state again:
- p1 is in location l2_8 (city c2)
- p2 is in location l1_7 (city c1)
- t1 is in location l1_4 (city c1)
- t2 is in location l2_3 (city c2)
- a1 is in location l1_1 (city c1's airport)
- a2 is in location l2_1 (city c2's airport)

Let me revise the plan again:

For p1 (from l2_8 to l1_1):
1. Initially, p1 is in l2_8, which satisfies constraint 2.
2. Given constraint 3, we need to move p1 to l2_5 since p2 is not in l1_2. (Or we could move p2 to l1_2, but let's stick with the first option for now.)
3. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_8.
4. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_8.
5. Drive t2 from l2_8 to l2_5 (satisfying constraint 3).
6. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (airport).
7. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1.
8. Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1.
9. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
10. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1 (final goal).

For p2 (from l1_7 to l2_6):
1. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_7.
2. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_7.
3. Drive t1 from l1_7 to l1_8 (satisfying part of constraint 6).
4. Drive t1 from l1_8 to l1_1 (airport).
5. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1.
6. Load p2 onto a1 at l1_1.
7. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
8. Unload p2 from a1 at l2_1.
9. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_1.
10. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_8 (satisfying constraint 4).
11. Drive t2 from l2_8 to l2_7 (satisfying constraint 1).
12. Drive t2 from l2_7 to l2_6 (final goal).

But wait, we need to ensure that timing-wise all the constraints are satisfied. Let's re-check:

1. "Either p1 is in a1 or p2 is in location l2_7." This will be satisfied when we have p2 in l2_7.
2. "p1 is in location l2_8." This is initially satisfied.
3. "If p1 is in location l2_8, then either p2 is in location l1_2 or p1 is in location l2_5." This will be satisfied when we move p1 from l2_8 to l2_5.
4. "p2 is in location l2_8." This will be satisfied when we move p2 to l2_8.
5. "p2 is in a2." We need to ensure that, at some point, p2 is loaded onto a2, which I'd have it loaded onto a1 in the current plan. Let's adjust.
6. "Either p2 is in location l1_8 or p1 is in location l1_6." This will be satisfied when we move p2 to l1_8.

Ok, there's an issue. I had p2 loaded onto a1, but constraint 5 says p2 must be in a2 at some point. Let's adjust:

For p2 (from l1_7 to l2_6):
1. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_7.
2. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_7.
3. Drive t1 from l1_7 to l1_8 (satisfying part of constraint 6).
4. Drive t1 from l1_8 to l1_1 (airport).
5. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1.
6. Load p2 onto a2 at l1_1 (satisfying constraint 5).
7. Fly a2 from l1_1 to l2_1.
8. Unload p2 from a2 at l2_1.
9. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_1.
10. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_8 (satisfying constraint 4).
11. Drive t2 from l2_8 to l2_7 (satisfying constraint 1).
12. Drive t2 from l2_7 to l2_6 (final goal).

But wait, now I've messed up because a2 starts at l2_1, not l1_1. 

Hmm, let's rethink this.

Let me reconsider the initial state and adjust the plan accordingly:

Initial state:
- p1 is in location l2_8 (city c2)
- p2 is in location l1_7 (city c1)
- t1 is in location l1_4 (city c1)
- t2 is in location l2_3 (city c2)
- a1 is in location l1_1 (city c1's airport)
- a2 is in location l2_1 (city c2's airport)

Let's draft a step-by-step plan:

1. Move t2 from l2_3 to l2_8 to pick up p1.
   - drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_8 c2

2. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_8.
   - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_8

3. Move t2 from l2_8 to l2_5 (to satisfy constraint 3: "If p1 is in l2_8, then either p2 is in l1_2 or p1 is in l2_5").
   - drivetruck t2 l2_8 l2_5 c2

4. Move t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (airport).
   - drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2

5. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1.
   - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

6. Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1.
   - loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

7. Move t1 from l1_4 to l1_7 to pick up p2.
   - drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_7 c1

8. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_7.
   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_7

9. Move t1 from l1_7 to l1_8 (to satisfy constraint 6: "Either p2 is in l1_8 or p1 is in l1_6").
   - drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_8 c1

10. Move t1 from l1_8 to l1_1 (airport).
    - drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_1 c1

11. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1.
    - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

12. Fly a2 (with p1) from l2_1 to l1_1.
    - flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

13. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1 (final goal).
    - unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

14. Load p2 onto a2 at l1_1 (to satisfy constraint 5: "p2 is in a2").
    - loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

15. Fly a2 (with p2) from l1_1 to l2_1.
    - flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1

16. Unload p2 from a2 at l2_1.
    - unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

17. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_1.
    - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

18. Move t2 from l2_1 to l2_8 (to satisfy constraint 4: "p2 is in l2_8").
    - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_8 c2

19. Move t2 from l2_8 to l2_7 (to satisfy constraint 1: "Either p1 is in a1 or p2 is in l2_7").
    - drivetruck t2 l2_8 l2_7 c2

20. Move t2 from l2_7 to l2_6 (final goal).
    - drivetruck t2 l2_7 l2_6 c2

Let's trace through the constraints again:

1. "Either p1 is in a1 or p2 is in location l2_7." This is satisfied in step 19 when p2 is in l2_7.
2. "p1 is in location l2_8." This is initially satisfied.
3. "If p1 is in location l2_8, then either p2 is in location l1_2 or p1 is in location l2_5." Initially, p1 is in l2_8, and we move it to l2_5 in step 3, which satisfies this constraint.
4. "p2 is in location l2_8." This is satisfied in step 18.
5. "p2 is in a2." This is satisfied in step 14.
6. "Either p2 is in location l1_8 or p1 is in location l1_6." This is satisfied in step 9 when p2 is in l1_8.

Overall, the plan seems to satisfy all the goals and constraints. Let's review it once more:

The goal is to have p1 in l1_1 and p2 in l2_6, and the plan achieves both. The plan also ensures that all the specified constraints are satisfied at some point.

However, let's refine this a bit and look for optimizations:

It's unnecessary to move p1 from l2_8 to l2_5. The constraint says "If p1 is in l2_8, then either p2 is in l1_2 or p1 is in l2_5." But this constraint would be satisfied as soon as p1 is no longer in l2_8, which happens when we load it onto t2 in step 2.

Actually, I'm misreading the constraint. It's saying that at any state where p1 is in l2_8, either p2 is in l1_2 or p1 is in l2_5 must hold at the same state or a future state. Given that p1 is initially in l2_8, we need to move p2 to l1_2 or p1 to l2_5 at some point. I opt to move p1 to l2_5 because it's on our path to the airport.

Lastly, I had a thought: Instead of loading p1 onto a2 and then having a2 pick up p2, we could have each package be transported by its respective airplane. p1 by a2 (because a2 is already in l2_1, close to p1) and p2 by a1 (because a1 is already in l1_1, close to p2). This might optimize the plan further.

Let's refine the plan:

1. Move t2 from l2_3 to l2_8 to pick up p1.
   - drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_8 c2

2. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_8.
   - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_8

3. Move t2 from l2_8 to l2_5 (to satisfy constraint 3: "If p1 is in l2_8, then either p2 is in l1_2 or p1 is in l2_5").
   - drivetruck t2 l2_8 l2_5 c2

4. Move t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (airport).
   - drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2

5. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1.
   - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

6. Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1.
   - loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

7. Fly a2 (with p1) from l2_1 to l1_1.
   - flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

8. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1 (final goal for p1).
   - unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

9. Move t1 from l1_4 to l1_7 to pick up p2.
   - drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_7 c1

10. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_7.
    - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_7

11. Move t1 from l1_7 to l1_8 (to satisfy constraint 6: "Either p2 is in l1_8 or p1 is in l1_6").
    - drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_8 c1

12. Move t1 from l1_8 to l1_1 (airport).
    - drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_1 c1

13. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1.
    - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

14. Load p2 onto a2 at l1_1 (to satisfy constraint 5: "p2 is in a2").
    - loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

15. Fly a2 (with p2) from l1_1 to l2_1.
    - flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1

16. Unload p2 from a2 at l2_1.
    - unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

17. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_1.
    - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

18. Move t2 from l2_1 to l2_8 (to satisfy constraint 4: "p2 is in l2_8").
    - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_8 c2

19. Move t2 from l2_8 to l2_7 (to satisfy constraint 1: "Either p1 is in a1 or p2 is in l2_7").
    - drivetruck t2 l2_8 l2_7 c2

20. Move t2 from l2_7 to l2_6 (final goal for p2).
    - drivetruck t2 l2_7 l2_6 c2

Let me check if there's any ordering dependency in the plan:

- We need to deliver p1 before picking up p2 with the airplane a2. So, steps 1-8 should come before steps 14-16.
- Steps 9-13 (transporting p2 from l1_7 to l1_1) can be interleaved with steps 1-8 (transporting p1 from l2_8 to l1_1).
- Steps 17-20 (transporting p2 from l2_1 to l2_6) can only happen after step 16 (unloading p2 from a2 at l2_1).

Other than the ones I pointed out, the rest of the steps can potentially be rearranged for efficiency.

Actually, on a closer look, I realize that we're not optimizing fully. If a1 is in l1_1 and p2 is in l1_1, we could use a1 to transport p2 to l2_1, rather than having a2 go from l2_1 to l1_1 and then back to l2_1. Let's refine further:

1. Move t2 from l2_3 to l2_8 to pick up p1.
   - drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_8 c2

2. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_8.
   - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_8

3. Move t2 from l2_8 to l2_5 (to satisfy constraint 3: "If p1 is in l2_8, then either p2 is in l1_2 or p1 is in l2_5").
   - drivetruck t2 l2_8 l2_5 c2

4. Move t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (airport).
   - drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2

5. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1.
   - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

6. Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1.
   - loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

7. Move t1 from l1_4 to l1_7 to pick up p2.
   - drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_7 c1

8. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_7.
   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_7

9. Move t1 from l1_7 to l1_8 (to satisfy constraint 6: "Either p2 is in l1_8 or p1 is in l1_6").
   - drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_8 c1

10. Move t1 from l1_8 to l1_1 (airport).
    - drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_1 c1

11. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1.
    - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

12. Load p2 onto a2 at l1_1 (to satisfy constraint 5: "p2 is in a2").
    - [*** This cannot be done because a2 is still at l2_1. Let me rethink some things...]

Ok, I realize I made a mistake. a2 is in l2_1, and p1 is in l2_8. a1 is in l1_1, and p2 is in l1_7. Both airplanes should fly to the other city at some point to transport at least one package.

Let's rethink this. When we have p1 and p2 at the airports, we need to decide which airplane to use for each package.

If we use a2 to fly with p1 from l2_1 to l1_1, then we'd need a1 to fly with p2 from l1_1 to l2_1. This would save us some airplane flights, and since we have p2 on a1, we need some way to satisfy "p2 is in a2" (constraint 5).

That is, we have these constraints:
- "p2 is in a2" (constraint 5)
- "Either p1 is in a1 or p2 is in l2_7" (constraint 1)

We may not be able to satisfy "p1 is in a1", but we can ensure "p2 is in l2_7".

Let's refine the plan again:

1. Move t2 from l2_3 to l2_8 to pick up p1.
   - drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_8 c2

2. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_8.
   - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_8

3. Move t2 from l2_8 to l2_5 (to satisfy constraint 3: "If p1 is in l2_8, then either p2 is in l1_2 or p1 is in l2_5").
   - drivetruck t2 l2_8 l2_5 c2

4. Move t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (airport).
   - drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2

5. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1.
   - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

6. Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1.
   - loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

7. Move t1 from l1_4 to l1_7 to pick up p2.
   - drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_7 c1

8. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_7.
   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_7

9. Move t1 from l1_7 to l1_8 (to satisfy constraint 6: "Either p2 is in l1_8 or p1 is in l1_6").
   - drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_8 c1

10. Move t1 from l1_8 to l1_1 (airport).
    - drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_1 c1

11. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1.
    - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

12. Load p2 onto a1 at l1_1.
    - loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

13. Fly a2 (with p1) from l2_1 to l1_1.
    - flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

14. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1 (final goal for p1).
    - unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

15. Load p2 onto a2 at l1_1 (to satisfy constraint 5: "p2 is in a2").
    - loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

16. Unload p2 from a1 at l1_1.
    - unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

17. Load p2 onto a2 at l1_1 (to satisfy constraint 5: "p2 is in a2").
    - loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

18. Fly a2 (with p2) from l1_1 to l2_1.
    - flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1

19. Unload p2 from a2 at l2_1.
    - unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

20. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_1.
    - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

21. Move t2 from l2_1 to l2_8 (to satisfy constraint 4: "p2 is in l2_8").
    - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_8 c2

22. Move t2 from l2_8 to l2_7 (to satisfy constraint 1: "Either p1 is in a1 or p2 is in l2_7").
    - drivetruck t2 l2_8 l2_7 c2

23. Move t2 from l2_7 to l2_6 (final goal for p2).
    - drivetruck t2 l2_7 l2_6 c2

Oops, I think there's a logical error in steps 15-17. We can't have p2 on both a1 and a2 at the same time. Let's adjust:

1. Move t2 from l2_3 to l2_8 to pick up p1.
   - drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_8 c2

2. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_8.
   - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_8

3. Move t2 from l2_8 to l2_5 (to satisfy constraint 3: "If p1 is in l2_8, then either p2 is in l1_2 or p1 is in l2_5").
   - drivetruck t2 l2_8 l2_5 c2

4. Move t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (airport).

    - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

15. Load p2 onto a2 at l1_1 (to satisfy constraint 5: "p2 is in a2").
    - loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

16. Fly a2 (with p2) from l1_1 to l2_1.
    - flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1

19. Move t2 from l2_1 to l2_8 (to satisfy constraint 4: "p2 is in l2_8").
    - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_8 c2

20. Move t2 from l2_8 to l2_7 (to satisfy constraint 1: "Either p1 is in a1 or p2 is in l2_7").
    - drivetruck t2 l2_8 l2_7 c2

21. Move t2 from l2_7 to l2_6 (final goal for p2).
    - drivetruck t2 l2_7 l2_6 c2

But now, I realized that we're importing a1 to l2_1 in step 7, but not using it for anything. Let's remove it:

1. Move t2 from l2_3 to l2_8 to pick up p1.
   - drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_8 c2

2. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_8.
   - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_8

3. Move t2 from l2_8 to l2_5 (to satisfy constraint 3: "If p1 is in l2_8, then either p2 is in l1_2 or p1 is in l2_5").
   - drivetruck t2 l2_8 l2_5 c2

4. Move t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (airport).
   - drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2

5. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1.
   - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

6. Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1.
   - loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

7. Fly a2 (with p1) from l2_1 to l1_1.
   - flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

8. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1 (final goal for p1).
   - unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

9. Move t1 from l1_4 to l1_7 to pick up p2.
   - drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_7 c1

10. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_7.
    - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_7

11. Move t1 from l1_7 to l1_8 (to satisfy constraint 6: "Either p2 is in l1_8 or p1 is in l1_6").
    - drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_8 c1

12. Move t1 from l1_8 to l1_1 (airport).
    - drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_1 c1

13. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1.
    - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

14. Load p2 onto a2 at l1_1 (to satisfy constraint 5: "p2 is in a2").
    - loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

15. Fly a2 (with p2) from l1_1 to l2_1.
    - flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1

16. Unload p2 from a2 at l2_1.
    - unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

17. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_1.
    - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

18. Move t2 from l2_1 to l2_8 (to satisfy constraint 4: "p2 is in l2_8").
    - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_8 c2

19. Move t2 from l2_8 to l2_7 (to satisfy constraint 1: "Either p1 is in a1 or p2 is in l2_7").
    - drivetruck t2 l2_8 l2_7 c2

20. Move t2 from l2_7 to l2_6 (final goal for p2).
    - drivetruck t2 l2_7 l2_6 c2

This plan seems good, but there's still something I've missed: I need to satisfy "Either p1 is in a1 or p2 is in l2_7" (constraint 1).

Given that p1 is in l2_8 (initially) and p2 is in l1_7 (initially), it seems easier to satisfy "p2 is in l2_7". I've incorporated that in steps 19-20.

So the final plan is:

1. Move t2 from l2_3 to l2_8 to pick up p1.
   - drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_8 c2

2. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_8.
   - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_8

3. Move t2 from l2_8 to l2_5 (to satisfy constraint 3: "If p1 is in l2_8, then either p2 is in l1_2 or p1 is in l2_5").
   - drivetruck t2 l2_8 l2_5 c2

4. Move t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (airport).
   - drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2

5. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1.
   - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

6. Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1.
   - loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

7. Fly a2 (with p1) from l2_1 to l1_1.
   - flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

8. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1 (final goal for p1).
   - unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

9. Move t1 from l1_4 to l1_7 to pick up p2.
   - drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_7 c1

10. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_7.
    - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_7

11. Move t1 from l1_7 to l1_8 (to satisfy constraint 6: "Either p2 is in l1_8 or p1 is in l1_6").
    - drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_8 c1

12. Move t1 from l1_8 to l1_1 (airport).
    - drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_1 c1

13. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1.
    - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

14. Load p2 onto a2 at l1_1 (to satisfy constraint 5: "p2 is in a2").
    - loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

15. Fly a2 (with p2) from l1_1 to l2_1.
    - flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1

16. Unload p2 from a2 at l2_1.
    - unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

17. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_1.
    - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

18. Move t2 from l2_1 to l2_8 (to satisfy constraint 4: "p2 is in l2_8").
    - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_8 c2

19. Move t2 from l2_8 to l2_7 (to satisfy constraint 1: "Either p1 is in a1 or p2 is in l2_7").
    - drivetruck t2 l2_8 l2_7 c2

20. Move t2 from l2_7 to l2_6 (final goal for p2).
    - drivetruck t2 l2_7 l2_6 c2

Let me reread the initial state again to ensure I haven't mistaken any positions:

- p1 is in location l2_8 (city c2)
- p2 is in location l1_7 (city c1)
- t1 is in location l1_4 (city c1)
- t2 is in location l2_3 (city c2)
- a1 is in location l1_1 (city c1's airport)
- a2 is in location l2_1 (city c2's airport)

Yes, the plan seems to be aligned with the initial positions.

But wait, on second thought, I'm not so sure about my interpretation of constraint 3: "If p1 is in location l2_8, then either p2 is in location l1_2 or p1 is in location l2_5." Should I be understanding this as: any time that p1 is in l2_8, then it must be the case that subsequently either p2 moves to l1_2 or p1 moves to l2_5?

Ok, the constraint is talking about a state, so I think me interpretation was right: we need to make sure that whenever p1 is in l2_8, then either p2 is in l1_2 (not the case initially) or p1 is in l2_5 (which we enforce by moving p1 there).

Let me reaffirm the entire plan:

- Initial state: p1 is in l2_8, and p1 and p2 are not in their desired final locations.
- Goal: p1 should be in l1_1, and p2 should be in l2_6.
- Other constraints: p1 should be in l2_8 at some point (already the case initially), if p1 is in l2_8 then either p2 is in l1_2 or p1 is in l2_5 (we ensure by moving p1 to l2_5), p2 should be in l2_8 at some point, p2 should be in a2 at some point, and either p2 is in l1_8 or p1 is in l1_6 at some point (we ensure by moving p2 to l1_8).

The plan I proposed, in its current iteration, seems to satisfy all these requirements. Let's proceed with it.

Actually, on third thought, let's look at the constraints again:

3. "If expression 'Package p1 is in location l2_8' holds in some state s, then expression 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "Package p2 is in location l1_2", "Package p1 is in location l2_5"' must hold at s or at some state after s"

I was initially interpreting this correctly: p1 is initially in l2_8, so we need to make sure either p2 is in l1_2 or p1 is in l2_5 at some point (including the current state or later states). We chose to move p1 to l2_5 because it was on our path to the airport.

I just want to double-check that the current plan makes p1 go from l2_8 to l2_5. Yes, it does in step 3. Also, it makes p2 go from l1_7 to l1_8 in step 11 (to satisfy constraint 6: "Either p2 is in l1_8 or p1 is in l1_6").

Let's clarify this, and then I'm confident the plan is sound.
