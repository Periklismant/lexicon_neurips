Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. First, I need to understand the initial state, the goal, and the constraints. 

The initial state has packages p1 and p2 both in location l1_4 in city c1. Trucks t1 is in l1_4 (wait, the original state says "Package t1 is in location l1_4" — wait, that might be a typo. Because t1 is a truck, not a package. Maybe that's a mistake in the problem description. Let me check again. Oh, the user wrote "Package t1 is in location l1_4". That must be a typo. Probably, it should be "Truck t1 is in location l1_4". Similarly for "Package t2 is in location l2_5" — probably Truck t2 is in l2_5. And "Package a1 is in location l1_1" — since a1 is an airplane, so Airplane a1 is in l1_1. Same for a2. So I'll need to correct those in my mind. Otherwise, the problem doesn't make sense. So assuming that's a typo, the initial state is:

- Locations in c1: l1_1 (airport), l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5.
- Locations in c2: l2_1 (airport), l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5.
- Trucks: t1 in l1_4 (city c1), t2 in l2_5 (city c2).
- Airplanes: a1 in l1_1 (c1's airport), a2 in l2_1 (c2's airport).
- Packages: p1 and p2 both in l1_4 (c1).

The goal is to have p1 in l2_1 (which is c2's airport) and p2 in l2_2 (a location in c2).

Now, the constraints are several. Let's list them:

1. p1 must be in l1_1 in at least one state. And before that state, p2 must be in l1_5 or l2_3.
2. p2 must be in l2_1 in at least one state. Before that, p1 must be in l2_4 or p2 must be in l2_5.
3. p1 must be in l2_2 at some point.
4. p1 must be in l2_4 at some point.
5. p2 must be in l2_2 (which is also the goal, so that's covered).
6. Whenever p2 is in l2_2, before that, p2 was in l2_5 or p1 was in l2_2.

Hmm, these constraints need to be satisfied throughout the plan. So the plan must include these intermediate steps.

First, let's think about moving p1 and p2 from l1_4 in c1 to c2. Since cities are connected by airplanes, which can only move between airports. So likely, we need to use airplanes to move between c1 and c2. But first, the packages need to be transported to an airport in c1, then loaded onto an airplane, flown to c2's airport, then unloaded and transported via truck to their destinations.

But there are constraints that require certain intermediate steps. Let's start with p1's journey. The goal is to get p1 to l2_1. Wait, l2_1 is the airport in c2, which is where airplane a2 is initially. So maybe p1 can be flown to l2_1 via airplane a1 (which is in l1_1). Wait, but airplanes can fly between any airports. So, to get p1 from c1 to c2, we can load it onto a truck, drive the truck to l1_1 (the airport), load onto airplane a1, fly to l2_1, unload, and then maybe use a truck in c2 to move it to its destination. Wait, but p1's destination is l2_1, which is the airport, so maybe that's the end. Wait, no, the goal is p1 in l2_1. Wait, yes. Wait, the goal says "Package p1 is in location l2_1", which is the airport in c2. So p1 can be flown directly to l2_1 and stay there. But the constraints require that p1 is in l1_1 (airport of c1) at some point, which would naturally happen if we load it onto the airplane there. So that's covered. But the constraint for p1 being in l1_1 requires that in a prior state, p2 is in l1_5 or l2_3. So before p1 is in l1_1, p2 must be in one of those locations.

Wait, but initially p2 is in l1_4. So maybe we need to move p2 to l1_5 or l2_3 before moving p1 to l1_1. Let's see. Let's think about moving p2 first.

But the goal for p2 is l2_2 in c2. So p2 needs to get to c2. To do that, it can be transported via truck to l1_1 (airport), then flown to l2_1, then via truck in c2 to l2_2. But let's check the constraints.

Constraints related to p2:

- Must be in l2_1 at some state. Before that, p1 in l2_4 or p2 in l2_5. Initially, p2 is in l1_4. So to get p2 to l2_1, we need to fly it. But before that state (when p2 is in l2_1), there must be an earlier state where p1 is in l2_4 or p2 is in l2_5. Initially, p2 is in l1_4. So perhaps, during the plan, p2 is moved to l2_5 (which is in c2, but how?), but that's in c2. So perhaps, after moving p2 to c2's airport, then drive it to l2_5, but that's in the same city. Wait, l2_5 is a location in c2. So maybe after flying p2 to l2_1, drive it to l2_5 (using truck t2, which is in l2_5 initially). Then unload it there, which would satisfy the condition that before p2 is in l2_1 (during the flight), there was a state where p2 was in l2_5. But wait, the constraint says that if p2 is in l2_1 in some state, then before that, either p1 is in l2_4 or p2 is in l2_5. So if p2 is loaded into the airplane at l1_1 (c1's airport), then flown to l2_1 (c2's airport), that's when p2 arrives in l2_1. So before that flight, during the loading in l1_1, we need to have either p1 in l2_4 or p2 in l2_5. But at that point, p1 hasn't been moved yet. Wait, maybe we need to first move p2 to l2_5 somehow. But how? Because initially, p2 is in c1's l1_4. To get to c2's l2_5, it would need to be transported via airplane. But if we fly p2 to l2_1 first, then drive it to l2_5. Then unload it there. Then later, maybe load it again into a truck to take it to l2_2. But that seems complicated. Let's outline possible steps.

Let's consider the steps for p1:

p1 needs to go from l1_4 (c1) to l2_1 (c2's airport). To do that:

1. Load p1 into truck t1 (which is in l1_4) using loadtruck.
2. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1 (the airport in c1). But can t1 drive to l1_1? Since l1_4 and l1_1 are both in c1, yes. So drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1.
3. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1.
4. Load p1 onto airplane a1 (which is at l1_1) using loadairplane.
5. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
6. Unload p1 from a1 into l2_1. Now p1 is at the goal location.

But the constraints require that p1 is in l1_1 (which happens during step 3). And before that, p2 must be in l1_5 or l2_3. So before step 3 (unloading p1 into l1_1?), wait no. Wait, the constraint says: if p1 is in l1_1 in some state, then there must be an earlier state where p2 is in l1_5 or l2_3. Wait, when p1 is loaded into the airplane at l1_1, the package is in the airplane, not in the location. So maybe when the truck arrives at l1_1 and p1 is unloaded there. That would be the state where p1 is in l1_1. So during step 3, after unloading, p1 is in l1_1. So before that, p2 must have been in l1_5 or l2_3. So we need to arrange for p2 to be in one of those locations before that.

So how can we get p2 to l1_5 or l2_3 before p1 is unloaded at l1_1?

Initially, p2 is in l1_4 (same as p1). So to move p2 to l1_5 (which is in c1), we can load it into truck t1, drive to l1_5, unload. That would require:

- loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
- drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1
- unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

Then, after that, proceed to move p1 to l1_1. That way, when p1 is unloaded at l1_1, the prior state (p2 in l1_5) satisfies the constraint.

Alternatively, getting p2 to l2_3 (in c2) would require flying, but that's more steps. So maybe moving p2 to l1_5 first is easier.

So here's a possible sequence for p2:

But the goal for p2 is l2_2. So perhaps after moving p2 to l1_5, we have to bring it back? That seems inefficient. Alternatively, maybe after moving p2 to l2_3. But how?

Wait, perhaps the plan can interleave actions for p1 and p2.

Let's outline the steps:

First, handle the constraints related to p1's movement:

1. Move p2 to l1_5 or l2_3 before p1 is in l1_1.

Option 1: Move p2 to l1_5.

- Load p2 into t1 at l1_4: loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
- Drive t1 to l1_5: drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1
- Unload p2 there: unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

Now p2 is in l1_5. Then proceed with moving p1.

But after that, how to get p2 to c2's l2_2? We need to move p2 from l1_5 to c2. So perhaps:

- Drive t1 back to l1_4 (though why?), but maybe use another truck. Wait, in c1, we have t1. To move p2 from l1_5 to l1_1 (airport), we can drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_1 (assuming l1_5 is connected via roads in c1). Then load p2 onto airplane a1, fly to l2_1, etc.

But this would involve moving p2 to l1_5 first, then moving it again to l1_1, which adds steps. Alternatively, maybe it's more efficient to move p2 to l2_3 in c2 first. But how?

Wait, to get p2 to l2_3, which is in c2, we need to fly it there. But initially, p2 is in c1. So steps would be:

- Move p2 from l1_4 to l1_1 via truck.
- Load onto a1, fly to l2_1.
- Unload in l2_1, then use truck t2 (which is in l2_5) to drive to l2_3. But t2 is in l2_5, so we need to drive it to l2_1 first? Wait, l2_5 is in c2, so t2 can drive within c2.

But this approach would make p2 reach l2_3, satisfying the constraint. Then, when we later move p1 to l1_1 (as part of its journey), the prior state would have p2 in l2_3. But is this possible?

Wait, but the constraint for p1 being in l1_1 requires that before that state, p2 is in l1_5 or l2_3. So if we first move p2 to l2_3, then move p1 to l1_1, that would satisfy the constraint. But moving p2 to l2_3 would require flying to c2, then driving to l2_3. Let's see:

For p2:

1. Load p2 into t1 at l1_4.
2. Drive t1 to l1_1.
3. Unload p2 at l1_1.
4. Load p2 onto airplane a1.
5. Fly a1 to l2_1.
6. Unload p2 at l2_1.
7. Load p2 into truck t2 (which is in l2_5; but how to get t2 to l2_1? Because t2 is in l2_5 (city c2), we can drive it from l2_5 to l2_1. But that's a separate action. Wait, but the initial state says "Package t2 is in location l2_5" — again, probably a typo, it's Truck t2 in l2_5. So t2 is in l2_5. So to get t2 to l2_1, need to drive through the city c2's locations. Are l2_5 and l2_1 connected via roads? The locations in c2 are l2_1 (airport), l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5. So the truck can drive between any locations in the same city. So from l2_5 to l2_4 to l2_3 to l2_2 to l2_1? Or maybe there's a direct path. The problem states that trucks can move between any locations in the same city. So drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2. Wait, but the cities have their own locations, so the truck can move directly between any two locations in the same city. So if t2 is in l2_5, it can drive directly to l2_1. So that's possible. So:

7. Drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 (to get t2 to l2_1)
8. Load p2 into t2 at l2_1.
9. Drive t2 to l2_3.
10. Unload p2 there.

This would place p2 in l2_3. Then, when we later move p1 to l1_1 (as part of its journey to c2), the constraint is satisfied because p2 was in l2_3 before.

But this seems like a lot of steps. However, considering the constraints, we have to satisfy them. Let's see.

Alternatively, moving p2 to l1_5 first might be simpler. Let's explore that.

Plan for p2:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1
3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

Now, p2 is in l1_5. Then, we can proceed with moving p1 to l1_1. Let's do that for p1:

4. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 (Wait, t1 is in l1_5 after step 2. So after step 3, t1 is still in l1_5. So to move p1, which is in l1_4 initially. Wait, wait, initial state says p1 and p2 are both in l1_4. So if we first move p2 to l1_5 using t1, then t1 is in l1_5. To move p1, we need to get t1 back to l1_4. But that's an extra step. So:

Wait, initial steps:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (since t1 is in l1_4)
2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1
3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 → p2 is in l1_5, t1 is in l1_5.

Now, to move p1 (which is in l1_4) to l1_1, we need to use t1. But t1 is now in l1_5. So drive t1 from l1_5 back to l1_4:

4. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1
5. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
6. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
7. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 → now p1 is in l1_1.

At this point, the constraint that p1 is in l1_1 is satisfied, and the prior state (after step 3) has p2 in l1_5, satisfying the constraint that before p1 is in l1_1, p2 was in l1_5 or l2_3.

Then, proceed to fly p1 to l2_1:

8. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
9. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
10. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 → p1 is at the goal.

Now, p1's part is done. Now, for p2, which is in l1_5 (c1). We need to get it to l2_2 (c2). Steps:

11. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 (t1 is in l1_4 after step 6? Wait, after step 6, t1 is driven to l1_1. Wait, let's track the truck's location:

- Step 2: t1 driven to l1_5.
- Step 4: driven back to l1_4.
- Step 6: driven to l1_1.

So after step 6, t1 is in l1_1. Then, after step 7, p1 is unloaded in l1_1. So t1 remains in l1_1. So how to get p2 from l1_5 to l1_1? We need to use t1 again. But t1 is in l1_1. To reach l1_5, drive:

11. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
12. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
13. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
14. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 → p2 is in l1_1.

Then, load into airplane a1:

15. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
16. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
17. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 → p2 is in l2_1.

But the goal is to have p2 in l2_2. So from l2_1, use truck t2 (which is in l2_5 initially) to drive to l2_1, load p2, drive to l2_2, unload.

But first, get t2 to l2_1:

18. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
19. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
20. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
21. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 → goal achieved.

But now, we need to check the constraints related to p2. One constraint is that p2 must be in l2_1 at some state (step 17). Before that state, there must be a prior state where either p1 is in l2_4 or p2 is in l2_5. Let's see: when p2 is in l2_1 (step 17), the prior state would be when it was loaded into the airplane in l1_1 (step 15). So before step 15, we need to have either p1 in l2_4 or p2 in l2_5.

But p1 is in l2_1 (airport) at step 10. So p1 is in l2_1, not l2_4. So we need to have p2 in l2_5 at some point before step 17. How can that happen?

Alternatively, maybe during the steps for p2, we can have it in l2_5. Let's see. If after flying p2 to l2_1 (step 17), we then drive it to l2_5, then back to l2_1, but that's redundant. Alternatively, maybe in the initial steps, when moving p2, we take it to l2_5 first.

Wait, another constraint is that p1 must be in l2_4 at some state. So we need to have p1 in l2_4. But p1's goal is l2_1, so how can that happen? Maybe after unloading in l2_1, we move p1 to l2_4. But that would require a truck in c2. But why would we do that? Because the constraint requires that p1 is in l2_4 at some state. So perhaps after delivering p1 to l2_1, we need to move it to l2_4, then maybe back to l2_1. But that adds steps, but since the goal requires p1 to be in l2_1, but the constraints require that it was in l2_4 at some point. So we have to add steps to move p1 from l2_1 to l2_4 and back.

Let's adjust the plan:

After step 10 (p1 is in l2_1), use truck t2 to move p1 to l2_4.

But t2 is in l2_5. So:

11. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 (this was step 18 in previous plan)
12. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (but p1 is in l2_1)
13. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
14. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 → now p1 is in l2_4. This satisfies the constraint that p1 is in l2_4.

Then, we need to move p1 back to l2_1 for the goal:

15. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
16. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
17. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 → back to goal.

But this is adding unnecessary steps. Alternatively, perhaps during the process of moving p2, we can have p1 in l2_4. But how?

Alternatively, maybe during the flight of p1, after arriving at l2_1, we can move it to l2_4 using truck t2.

But this would complicate the plan and increase the number of steps. But since the constraints require that p1 is in l2_4 at some state, it's necessary.

So let's adjust the plan for p1:

After step 10 (p1 is in l2_1):

11. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
12. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
13. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
14. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 → p1 is in l2_4 (satisfies constraint)
15. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
16. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
17. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 → p1 back to goal.

But this adds four steps. Now, when p2 is loaded into the airplane (step 15 in the original plan), before that, we need to ensure that either p1 is in l2_4 or p2 is in l2_5. 

Wait, when p2 is loaded into the airplane (step 15 in the original plan), which is after step 14 in the adjusted plan where p1 is in l2_4. So during that step, p1 is in l2_4, which satisfies the constraint for p2 being loaded into the airplane (before p2 is in l2_1, which is after the flight). So this works.

But this seems quite involved. Let's try to outline the entire plan with all constraints:

1. Move p2 to l1_5 to satisfy the first constraint for p1 being in l1_1.

Steps:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1
3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 → p2 in l1_5.

Now, t1 is in l1_5. Need to move it back to l1_4 to load p1.

4. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1
5. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
6. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
7. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 → p1 in l1_1 (satisfies first constraint, with p2 in l1_5 earlier).

Now, fly p1 to l2_1:

8. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
9. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
10. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 → p1 at goal.

But need to have p1 in l2_4. So:

11. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 (move t2 to l2_1)
12. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
13. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
14. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 → p1 in l2_4 (satisfies constraint)
15. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
16. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
17. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 → p1 back to goal.

Now, handle p2:

p2 is in l1_5. Need to move to l2_2.

18. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1 (t1 is in l1_1 after step 7)
19. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
20. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
21. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 → p2 in l1_1.

22. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
23. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
24. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 → p2 in l2_1.

At this point, the constraint requires that before p2 is in l2_1, either p1 is in l2_4 or p2 is in l2_5. At step 24, p2 is in l2_1. Earlier, in step 14, p1 was in l2_4, so that satisfies the constraint.

Then, move p2 to l2_2:

25. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2 (t2 is in l2_1 after step 17)
26. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 → wait, t2 is in l2_1, but p2 is in l2_1. So:

25. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
26. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
27. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 → goal achieved.

Now, check other constraints:

- p2 must be in l2_2 (achieved at step 27).
- The constraint that if p2 is in l2_2, then before that, p2 was in l2_5 or p1 was in l2_2. Here, before step 27, p2 was in l2_1 (step 24), then loaded into t2 and driven to l2_2. So before p2 is in l2_2, it was in l2_1. But the constraint requires that before p2 is in l2_2, there was a state where p2 was in l2_5 or p1 was in l2_2. Neither of these happened. So this plan fails that constraint.

Ah, right. So when p2 arrives in l2_2 (step 27), the constraint requires that in some earlier state, p2 was in l2_5 or p1 was in l2_2. But in this plan, p1 was never in l2_2, and p2 was never in l2_5. So this violates the last constraint.

So we need to adjust the plan to satisfy that. So, how can we ensure that before p2 is in l2_2, either p2 was in l2_5 or p1 was in l2_2.

Option 1: Have p1 in l2_2 at some point. But the goal is p1 in l2_1, so that would require moving p1 from l2_1 to l2_2, then back. But that's adding steps. Alternatively, have p2 in l2_5 before.

Option 2: Have p2 pass through l2_5 before reaching l2_2.

So after step 24 (p2 in l2_1), drive it to l2_5, then back to l2_2. Let's see:

25. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2 (t2 was in l2_1)
26. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 (but p2 is in l2_1, so this can't happen. Wait, no. After step 24, p2 is in l2_1. So to move p2 to l2_5:

25. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (t2 is in l2_1 after step 17)
26. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
27. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 → p2 in l2_5.

Now, this satisfies the constraint that before p2 is in l2_1 (step 24?), wait no. Step 24 is p2 in l2_1. But we need to have p2 in l2_5 before p2 is in l2_1. But in this case, we're moving p2 to l2_5 after being in l2_1. That doesn't help. Alternatively, before flying p2 to l2_1, we need to have p2 in l2_5.

Wait, the constraint for p2 being in l2_1 is that before that state, either p1 is in l2_4 or p2 is in l2_5. In the current plan, before p2 is in l2_1 (step 24), p1 was in l2_4 (step 14), so that's okay. But the constraint for p2 being in l2_2 (step 27) requires that before that, p2 was in l2_5 or p1 was in l2_2. So if we can have p2 in l2_5 before step 27, then it's okay.

So after step 24, p2 is in l2_1. Then:

25. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (t2 is in l2_1)
26. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
27. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 → p2 in l2_5.

Then:

28. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
29. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
30. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 → goal.

Now, when p2 is in l2_2 (step 30), the prior state (step 27) has p2 in l2_5, satisfying the constraint.

But this adds more steps, but it's necessary. Also, need to check other constraints.

Additionally, another constraint is that p1 must be in l2_2 at some state. Wait, no. The constraints listed:

Wait, let's recheck the user's problem constraints:

The constraints are:

1. p1 in l1_1 at least once, with prior p2 in l1_5 or l2_3.
2. p2 in l2_1 at least once, with prior p1 in l2_4 or p2 in l2_5.
3. p1 in l2_2 at least once.
4. p1 in l2_4 at least once.
5. p2 in l2_2 (which is the goal).
6. Whenever p2 is in l2_2, prior state has p2 in l2_5 or p1 in l2_2.

So in the current plan:

- p1 is in l2_4 (step 14) → satisfies constraint 4.
- p2 is in l2_1 (step 24) → satisfies constraint 2 (prior p1 in l2_4)
- p1 is in l2_2? No. So the constraint 3 requires that p1 is in l2_2 at some state. But in the current plan, p1 is never in l2_2. So this is missing.

So to satisfy constraint 3, we need to have p1 in l2_2 at some point. So we have to add steps to move p1 to l2_2 and possibly back to l2_1.

But the goal is p1 in l2_1, so we can't leave it in l2_2. So the plan must include moving p1 to l2_2 and then back to l2_1.

This complicates things, but it's necessary. So let's adjust:

After step 17, where p1 is back in l2_1 (goal), we need to move it to l2_2 and back.

But that's adding steps. Alternatively, during the steps where p1 is moved to l2_4, maybe we can move it via l2_2.

But l2_4 and l2_2 are both in c2. So maybe:

After step 13 (drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2), instead of going directly to l2_4, go through l2_2.

Wait, but can a truck drive directly from l2_1 to l2_4? The problem states that trucks can move between any locations in the same city. So yes. But if we need to have p1 in l2_2, we can detour.

Alternative steps for moving p1 to l2_4:

12. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
13. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
14. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 → p1 in l2_2 (satisfies constraint 3)
15. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
16. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2
17. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 → satisfies constraint 4)
18. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
19. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
20. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 → back to goal.

Now, this satisfies constraints 3 and 4.

So integrating this into the plan:

After step 10 (p1 in l2_1 via airplane):

11. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 (t2 is in l2_5 initially)
12. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
13. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
14. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 → p1 in l2_2 (constraint 3)
15. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
16. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2
17. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 → constraint 4
18. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
19. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
20. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 → goal.

Now, proceed with p2:

p2 is in l1_5 (step 3), needs to reach l2_2.

21. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1 (t1 is in l1_1 after step 7)
22. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
23. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
24. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 → p2 in l1_1
25. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
26. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
27. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 → p2 in l2_1 (constraint 2, prior p1 in l2_4)
28. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (t2 is in l2_1 after step 20)
29. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
30. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 → p2 in l2_5 (satisfies constraint for when p2 is in l2_2 later)
31. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
32. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
33. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 → goal (constraint 6: prior state p2 in l2_5)

Now, check all constraints:

1. p1 in l1_1 (step 7), with prior p2 in l1_5 (step 3) → satisfied.
2. p2 in l2_1 (step 27), with prior p1 in l2_4 (step 17) → satisfied.
3. p1 in l2_2 (step 14) → satisfied.
4. p1 in l2_4 (step 17) → satisfied.
5. p2 in l2_2 (step 33) → satisfied.
6. When p2 is in l2_2 (step 33), prior state p2 in l2_5 (step 30) → satisfied.

This seems to satisfy all constraints. Now, let's count the steps:

The entire plan would be:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1
3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
4. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1
5. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
6. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
7. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
8. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
9. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
10. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
11. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
12. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
13. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
14. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
15. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
16. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2
17. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
18. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
19. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
20. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
21. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
22. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
23. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
24. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
25. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
26. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
27. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
28. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
29. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
30. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
31. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
32. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
33. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

But this plan has 33 steps, which seems very long. Perhaps there's a more optimal way. Let's look for redundancies.

For example, steps 4-6 involve driving t1 back to l1_4 to load p1. But after step 3, t1 is in l1_5. So steps 4 is driving from l1_5 to l1_4. Then steps 5 and 6 drive to l1_1. Maybe there's a way to combine these steps.

Alternatively, after step 3 (t1 in l1_5 with p2 unloaded), can we drive t1 directly to l1_1 to load p1 there? But p1 is in l1_4 initially. So no, p1 is in l1_4, and to load it into t1, t1 needs to be in l1_4.

So steps 4-6 are necessary.

Another possible optimization: When moving p1 from l2_1 to l2_2, l2_4, and back, maybe there's a shorter path. But given the constraints, it's necessary to visit those locations.

Alternatively, perhaps we can move p1 to l2_4 first, then to l2_2. But the constraint requires p1 to be in l2_2 and l2_4. So the order might not matter.

Another thought: When moving p2, after flying to l2_1, why not directly drive to l2_2 instead of going through l2_5? But the constraint for p2 in l2_2 requires that before that, p2 was in l2_5 or p1 was in l2_2. In this plan, before p2 is in l2_2 (step 33), p2 was in l2_5 (step 30). So that works. But if we don't go through l2_5, then we need to have p1 in l2_2 earlier. Which is the case, since p1 was in l2_2 (step 14). So maybe we can avoid the detour to l2_5.

Let's rethink the p2 movement after step 27 (p2 in l2_1):

At step 27, p2 is in l2_1. The constraint for p2 being in l2_2 requires that before that, p2 was in l2_5 or p1 was in l2_2. But p1 was in l2_2 at step 14. So if we move p2 from l2_1 to l2_2 directly, does that satisfy the constraint? Because before p2 is in l2_2, there was a state (step 14) where p1 was in l2_2. So yes.

So perhaps, instead of steps 28-33, we can do:

28. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (t2 is in l2_1 after step 20)
29. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
30. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 → goal.

This would save steps. But does this satisfy constraint 6? Because when p2 is in l2_2 (step 30), the prior state must have p2 in l2_5 or p1 in l2_2. In this case, p1 was in l2_2 at step 14. Since step 14 occurs before step 30, this satisfies the constraint.

Yes, because the constraint is that if p2 is in l2_2 in some state, there must be an earlier state (any earlier state) where either p2 was in l2_5 or p1 was in l2_2. In this case, p1 was in l2_2 at step 14, which is earlier than step 30. So this works.

So the revised plan for p2 after step 27 is:

28. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
29. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
30. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 → goal.

This reduces the steps and satisfies the constraint.

So now, the entire plan would be:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1
3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
4. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1
5. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
6. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
7. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
8. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
9. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
10. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
11. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
12. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
13. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
14. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
15. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
16. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2
17. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
18. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
19. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
20. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
21. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
22. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
23. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
24. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
25. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
26. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
27. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
28. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
29. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
30. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

Now, check all constraints:

1. p1 in l1_1 (step 7), prior p2 in l1_5 (step 3) → ok.
2. p2 in l2_1 (step 27), prior p1 in l2_4 (step 17) → ok.
3. p1 in l2_2 (step 14) → ok.
4. p1 in l2_4 (step 17) → ok.
5. p2 in l2_2 (step 30) → ok.
6. For p2 in l2_2 (step 30), prior state with p1 in l2_2 (step 14) → ok.

This plan has 30 steps, which is still long. But perhaps there's a more optimal path.

Wait, let's see if there's a way to combine movements. For example, when moving p2 to l1_5 and back, maybe we can use the same truck trips for both packages. Alternatively, perhaps we can load both p1 and p2 into the same truck and drive them together. But since they both start in l1_4, maybe:

Load both p1 and p2 into t1 at l1_4, drive to l1_1, then unload both. But according to the problem's actions, each load/unload is per package. So you can't load multiple packages at once. So that's not possible.

Another optimization: After step 3 (p2 in l1_5), instead of driving t1 back to l1_4 to load p1, perhaps drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_1 directly, but then p1 is still in l1_4. So that's not helpful.

Alternatively, use another truck. But the problem only has t1 in c1 and t2 in c2. So no, only t1 in c1.

Another idea: When moving p2 to l1_5, maybe we can later move it to l1_1 using a different truck, but there's no other truck in c1. So must use t1.

Thus, the steps seem necessary.

Now, checking for optimality: The user requires an optimal plan, i.e., the shortest possible. So maybe there's a shorter path.

Let's think differently. What if we fly p2 to l2_1 first, then handle the constraints.

But let's see:

Initial state:

p1 and p2 are in l1_4 (c1).

To fly p2 to l2_1:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
4. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
6. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 → p2 in l2_1.

But before p2 is in l2_1 (step 6), we need to have either p1 in l2_4 or p2 in l2_5. At this point, p1 is still in l1_4, and p2 hasn't been to l2_5. So this violates constraint 2. So we need to adjust.

Alternatively, before flying p2 to l2_1, drive p2 to l2_5 in c2. But that requires flying p2 to l2_1, then driving to l2_5. But then that's after the flight. No, the constraint requires that before p2 is in l2_1, either p1 is in l2_4 or p2 is in l2_5. So it's not possible if we fly p2 directly.

Thus, the initial approach seems necessary.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use airplane a2, which is in l2_1, to fly p2 from l1_1 to l2_1. But a2 is in l2_1 initially. To use it, we need to fly it to l1_1 first. But that's possible. So:

Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1, load p2, fly back.

But that adds steps. Let's see:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 → p2 in l1_1
4. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
5. loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
6. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
7. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 → p2 in l2_1.

Before step 7, p2 is in l2_1. The constraint requires that prior to that, p1 is in l2_4 or p2 is in l2_5. But p1 is still in l1_4, and p2 hasn't been to l2_5. So this violates constraint 2. So not helpful.

Hmm. It seems that the initial plan is necessary to satisfy all constraints. Therefore, the steps outlined earlier are required.

But to make the plan optimal, perhaps there's a shorter way. Let's see:

In the current plan, steps 21-24 involve moving p2 from l1_5 to l1_1 using t1. But after step 7, t1 is in l1_1. So steps 21 is drivetruck t1 from l1_1 to l1_5, load p2, drive back to l1_1, unload. These steps are necessary.

So the total number of steps is 30, but perhaps there's a way to combine actions.

Alternatively, after moving p1 to l1_1 (step 7), can we immediately load p1 into the airplane, fly it to l2_1, and then handle the constraints for p1's location in c2.

Yes, but the steps for p1's constraints (being in l2_2 and l2_4) are necessary.

But perhaps there's a way to optimize the order of moving p1 and p2 to reduce steps.

Alternatively, can we move p2 to l2_3 instead of l1_5 to satisfy the first constraint? Let's explore:

To move p2 to l2_3, we need to:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
4. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
6. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
7. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
8. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
9. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
10. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 → p2 in l2_3.

Now, when p1 is moved to l1_1 (step 7 in the previous plan), the prior state has p2 in l2_3, satisfying the constraint. Then proceed with p1's journey.

But this approach requires more steps, but may allow for shorter overall plan. Let's see:

After p2 is in l2_3 (step 10), move p1:

11. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4 (assuming t1 is back in l1_4)
12. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
13. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 → p1 in l1_1 (constraint 1 met with prior p2 in l2_3)
14. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
15. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
16. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 → p1 in l2_1.

Then handle p1's constraints:

17. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2 (t2 is in l2_3 after step 10)
18. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
19. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
20. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 → constraint 3
21. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
22. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2
23. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 → constraint 4
24. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
25. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
26. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 → back to goal.

Then move p2 from l2_3 to l2_2:

27. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
28. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2
29. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 → goal.

This plan has 29 steps. But need to check constraints:

1. p1 in l1_1 (step 13), prior p2 in l2_3 (step 10) → ok.
2. p2 in l2_1 (step 6), prior p1 not in l2_4 and p2 not in l2_5 → violates constraint 2. Because step 6 is p2 in l2_1, and prior to that, p1 is still in l1_4, and p2 was in l1_1. So this violates constraint 2. Hence, this approach doesn't work.

Thus, the initial plan seems to be the only way to satisfy all constraints. Therefore, the optimal plan is the one with 30 steps as outlined earlier.

But wait, the user requires an optimal plan with the minimal steps. The plan I have has 30 steps, but perhaps there's a way to make it shorter.

Another idea: Use both airplanes a1 and a2. For example, fly a2 to c1 to help transport.

But initially, a2 is in l2_1. So fly a2 to l1_1, load p2, fly back. This might save steps.

Let me try:

For p2's journey:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 → p2 in l1_1.
4. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 → a2 now in l1_1.
5. loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
6. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1 → p2 in l2_1.
7. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 → p2 in l2_1.

Now, before step 7, p2 is in l2_1. The constraint requires prior p1 in l2_4 or p2 in l2_5. At this point, p1 is still in l1_4, and p2 hasn't been to l2_5. So violates constraint 2. So need to have p2 in l2_5 before.

Thus, after step 7:

8. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (t2 needs to be driven to l2_1)
9. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 (assuming t2 is in l2_5)
10. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
11. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
12. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 → p2 in l2_5.
13. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
14. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
15. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 → goal.

But again, this adds steps and may not help.

I think the original plan is the only way to satisfy all constraints. Therefore, the optimal plan is as outlined earlier with 30 steps. However, this seems very long, and perhaps there's a shorter way that I'm missing.

Wait, maybe after moving p1 to l2_2 and l2_4, we can use the same truck trip to move p2. For example, after moving p1 to l2_2 (step 14), then load p2 into the same truck and drive to l2_2. But p2 is in l2_1 at that point.

Alternatively, during the steps when t2 is moving p1 around c2, maybe we can also move p2. But since p2 is in l1_1 initially, it takes time to get it to c2.

Another observation: The initial plan uses airplane a1 to fly both p1 and p2. But a1 starts in l1_1. So after flying p1 to l2_1 (step 9-10), a1 is in l2_1. To fly p2, we need to fly a1 back to l1_1. So:

After step 10 (a1 in l2_1), fly a1 back to l1_1 to pick up p2:

11. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
12. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
13. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
14. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 → p2 in l2_1.

This adds steps 11-14, but reduces the need to drive t1 back and forth.

But this approach might save steps compared to the original plan. Let's see:

Original plan steps for p2 after p1 is done:

21. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
22. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
23. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
24. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
25. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
26. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
27. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

If instead, after step 10 (p1 in l2_1), we fly a1 back to l1_1:

11. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
12. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
13. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
14. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 → p2 in l2_1.

This would replace steps 21-27 with steps 11-14, saving steps. But this requires that p2 is already in l1_1. How?

Wait, initially, p2 is in l1_4. So to get p2 to l1_1, we need to move it via truck t1. So steps for p2:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 → p2 in l1_1.

Then, p1's steps:

4. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4 (but t1 is in l1_1 now. So this is impossible. So this approach doesn't work unless we move t1 back.

This indicates that even if we use airplane a1 to fly p2, we still need to move p2 to l1_1 via truck, which requires steps that are already in the original plan.

Thus, the original plan remains the shortest way to satisfy all constraints. Therefore, the optimal plan is the one with 30 steps as outlined earlier.
