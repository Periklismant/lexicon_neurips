Okay, I will provide a plan to solve the logistic problem.

First, let's clarify a couple of points from the problem description:
1.  In the "Available actions" section, the action "unloadairplane p ap l" is listed with the description "Unload package p from airplane ap in location l." but the action name itself is written as "loadairplane p ap l". I will assume the action name is `unloadairplane p ap l` as per its description and common PDDL conventions.
2.  In the "Original state of the world", lines like "Package t1 is in location l1_3" should refer to trucks and airplanes, not packages. I will assume "Truck t1 is in location l1_3", "Truck t2 is in location l2_4", "Airplane a1 is in location l1_1", and "Airplane a2 is in location l2_1".

The goal is to have Package p1 in location l2_4 and Package p2 in location l1_2. Both packages start in their goal locations. However, several intermediate constraints must be satisfied during the plan.

The plan will first handle Package p2's constraints, then Package p1's constraints, and ensure both end up in their goal locations.

**Constraints to satisfy:**
1.  "Package p2 is in location l1_3" OR "Package p2 is in location l2_1"
2.  "Package p1 is in location l1_8"
3.  "Package p1 is in a1" OR "Package p1 is in a2"
4.  "Package p1 is in location l1_2"
5.  "Package p2 is in t1"

**Plan:**

```
drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
