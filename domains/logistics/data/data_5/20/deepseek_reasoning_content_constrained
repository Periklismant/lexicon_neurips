Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. Hmm, the goal is to have p1 in l2_4 and p2 in l1_2. But wait, looking at the initial state, p1 is already in l2_4, and p2 is in l1_2. So does that mean the goal is already satisfied? But maybe there are constraints that require us to move them around and then bring them back. Because the constraints must be met in at least one state during the plan.

Let me check the constraints again. There are five constraints:

1. At least one state where p2 is in l1_3 or l2_1.
2. At least one state where p1 is in l1_8.
3. At least one state where p1 is in a1 or a2.
4. At least one state where p1 is in l1_2.
5. At least one state where p2 is in t1.

Since the initial positions already satisfy the goal, but we need to satisfy all constraints during the plan. So the plan must include actions that temporarily move p1 and p2 to meet these constraints, then bring them back to their original locations.

Let's start with p2. The fifth constraint requires p2 to be in t1 at some point. Initially, p2 is in l1_2. So we need to load p2 into t1. But t1 is a truck, which is in city c1. The initial state says "Package t1 is in location l1_3". Wait, wait, the initial state mentions "Package t1 is in location l1_3", but t1 is a truck. Wait, that's a typo in the problem description. Let me check the original state again. The original state lists:

"Package t1 is in location l1_3"

Wait, t1 is a truck, not a package. That must be a mistake. Similarly, "Package t2 is in location l2_4", but t2 is a truck. The user probably meant "Truck t1 is in location l1_3", and "Truck t2 is in location l2_4". Similarly, "Package a1 is in location l1_1" but a1 is an airplane. So the problem statement has a mix-up between packages, trucks, and airplanes. That's confusing. Wait, the objects include "truck t1", "truck t2", "airplane a1", "airplane a2", and packages p1, p2. So the initial state entries like "Package t1 is in location l1_3" must be errors. The user probably intended "Truck t1 is in location l1_3", "Truck t2 is in location l2_4", "Airplane a1 is in location l1_1", etc. Because otherwise, you can't load packages into trucks or airplanes if the trucks and airplanes are not present in some location.

Assuming that's a typo, let's correct it in our understanding. So:

Original state:

- Truck t1 is in l1_3 (city c1)
- Truck t2 is in l2_4 (city c2)
- Airplane a1 is in l1_1 (airport in c1)
- Airplane a2 is in l2_1 (airport in c2)
- Package p1 is in l2_4 (city c2)
- Package p2 is in l1_2 (city c1)

With that corrected, let's proceed.

The goal is p1 in l2_4 and p2 in l1_2, which are already true. So the plan must create a sequence where these packages are moved and then returned, but all constraints are met during the process.

Let's break down the constraints:

1. At some state: p2 is in l1_3 or l2_1.
   - To get p2 to l1_3: Since p2 starts in l1_2 (c1), use truck t1 (in l1_3). Wait, t1 is in l1_3. So to load p2 into t1, we need to move t1 to l1_2. Then load p2 into t1. Then drive t1 to l1_3 and unload p2 there. That would satisfy the first constraint. Alternatively, take p2 to l2_1 (an airport in c2). That would require moving p2 from c1 to c2, which would involve airplanes.

2. At some state: p1 is in l1_8 (c1). Since p1 starts in l2_4 (c2), need to move it to c1. That requires using an airplane. So load p1 into a truck in c2 (t2 is in l2_4, so drive t2 to l2_4 (already there?), then load p1 into t2. Then drive t2 to the airport l2_1 (which is in c2). Unload p1 at l2_1, load into airplane a2, fly to l1_1 (c1's airport). Then unload p1 into a truck (t1?), drive to l1_8. Then perhaps bring it back.

3. At some state: p1 is in a1 or a2. So during transport, when p1 is loaded into an airplane, that condition is met.

4. At some state: p1 is in l1_2 (c1). So after moving p1 to c1, need to take it to l1_2.

5. At some state: p2 is in t1. So load p2 into t1, then perhaps unload again.

But the plan must end with p1 in l2_4 and p2 in l1_2. So after all these movements, we have to bring them back.

Let's outline possible steps:

For constraint 5: Load p2 into t1. Since t1 is in l1_3, and p2 is in l1_2, need to drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_2. Then load p2 into t1. Then maybe unload it back to l1_2 later.

For constraint 1: If we load p2 into t1 (which would require moving t1 to l1_2 first), then after loading, p2 is in t1. Then, drive t1 to l1_3 and unload p2 there. That would satisfy constraint 1 (p2 in l1_3). Then, to get p2 back to l1_2, drive t1 back and unload.

But how to handle all constraints:

Constraints:

1. p2 in l1_3 or l2_1 at some point.

2. p1 in l1_8.

3. p1 in a1 or a2.

4. p1 in l1_2.

5. p2 in t1.

We need to make sure that all these are met.

Let's start with p1. Since it's initially in l2_4 (c2), to get it to l1_8 (c1), we need to:

- Move it to an airport in c2 (l2_1), load into airplane a2, fly to c1's airport l1_1, then transport via truck to l1_8.

But along the way, when p1 is loaded into a2 (airplane), that satisfies constraint 3. Then, when it's unloaded in l1_1, perhaps move it via truck to l1_2 (satisfying constraint 4), then to l1_8 (constraint 2), and then back to l2_4.

But how to get back? Hmm. Let's think.

Alternatively, maybe the plan is to:

For p1:

1. Load p1 into t2 (truck in l2_4). But t2 is already in l2_4. So load p1 into t2 (loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4). Then drive t2 to l2_1 (airport in c2). Then unload p1 at l2_1. Then load it into airplane a2 (loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1). Fly a2 to l1_1. Then unload p1 from a2. Now p1 is in l1_1. Then load into a truck (t1 is in l1_3, so drive t1 to l1_1, load p1 into t1, drive to l1_2 (constraint 4), then to l1_8 (constraint 2). Then bring back: drive t1 to l1_1, unload p1, load into a1, fly back to l2_1, unload, load into t2, drive back to l2_4. But that's a lot of steps. But considering constraints, maybe it's necessary.

For p2:

Load into t1 (drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_2, load p2, which is in l1_2. Then drive to l1_3, unload (satisfy constraint 1). Then drive back to l1_2 and unload again to meet the goal.

Now, let's check the constraints:

- Constraint 5: p2 in t1 is satisfied when loaded.

- Constraint 1: when unloaded in l1_3.

- For p1: during the process, it's in a2 (constraint 3), then in l1_2 (constraint4), then in l1_8 (constraint2).

So possible steps:

1. For p1:

   a. Load p1 into t2 (t2 is at l2_4).

   Action: loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

   Then drive t2 to l2_1.

   Action: drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2

   Unload p1 at l2_1.

   Action: unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

   Load into a2.

   Action: loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

   Fly a2 to l1_1.

   Action: flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

   Unload p1 from a2.

   Action: unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

   Now, need to get p1 to l1_2 and l1_8.

   Use truck t1. t1 is in l1_3. Drive to l1_1.

   Action: drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1

   Load p1 into t1.

   Action: loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

   Drive to l1_2.

   Action: drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1

   Unload p1 here (constraint4).

   Action: unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2

   Then load again into t1, drive to l1_8.

   Action: loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2

   Action: drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_8 c1

   Unload p1 at l1_8 (constraint2).

   Action: unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_8

   Now need to bring p1 back to l2_4.

   From l1_8, drive t1 back to l1_1 (maybe):

   Action: drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_1 c1

   Unload p1 at l1_1.

   Action: unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

   Load into a1 (assuming a1 is at l1_1).

   Action: loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

   Fly a1 to l2_1.

   Action: flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

   Unload p1.

   Action: unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

   Load into t2.

   Action: loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

   Drive t2 to l2_4.

   Action: drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2

   Unload p1 at l2_4.

   Action: unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

   This brings p1 back.

For p2:

   Initially in l1_2. Need to load into t1 (constraint5).

   So drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_2.

   Action: drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1

   Load p2.

   Action: loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

   Now p2 is in t1 (constraint5 met).

   Drive to l1_3.

   Action: drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1

   Unload p2 (constraint1 met).

   Action: unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

   Then drive back to l1_2 and unload again (but wait, the goal is to have p2 in l1_2. So we need to reload and unload there.

   So after unloading at l1_3, drive back to l1_2.

   Action: drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1

   Load p2 again (if needed?), but since the goal is to have p2 in l1_2, maybe after unloading at l1_3, we need to move p2 back.

   Wait, after unloading at l1_3, p2 is there. So to get back to l1_2, need to load into t1 again.

   So:

   Action: loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

   Action: drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1

   Action: unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

   So now p2 is back in l1_2.

But this adds steps. Let's count:

For p2:

- Drive t1 to l1_2 (from l1_3)

- Load p2 into t1 (constraint5 met)

- Drive to l1_3, unload (constraint1 met)

- Load again into t1, drive back to l1_2, unload.

This would meet all the p2 constraints.

Now, integrating all these steps into a plan.

But the problem is that this plan has many steps. However, since the problem requires an optimal plan (shortest possible), perhaps some steps can be combined or done in parallel.

Wait, but the constraints for p1 and p2 can be handled in parallel. Let's see.

But the plan must be a sequence of actions, so perhaps interleave the steps for p1 and p2 where possible.

But let's outline the steps for p1 and p2 separately, then see where they can be ordered optimally.

For p1:

1. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

2. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2

3. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

4. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

5. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

6. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

7. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1

8. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

9. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1

10. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 (constraint4)

11. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2

12. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_8 c1

13. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_8 (constraint2)

14. drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_1 c1

15. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

16. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

17. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

18. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

19. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

20. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2

21. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

For p2:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1

2. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (constraint5)

3. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1

4. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (constraint1)

5. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

6. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1

7. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

Now, combining these actions, ensuring that the order doesn't interfere. For example, the steps for p1 and p2 can be interleaved as long as they don't depend on the same resources.

For instance, actions involving t2 (for p1) and t1 (for p2) can be done in parallel. But since the plan is a sequence, we have to order them.

Looking for the shortest possible plan.

Wait, perhaps some steps can be optimized. For example, when moving p1 to l1_8, maybe after step 10 (unload at l1_2), we can drive directly to l1_8 without unloading first? Wait, step 10 is unloading at l1_2 to satisfy constraint4. Then step11 is loading again into t1 to take to l1_8.

Alternatively, maybe after step9 (drive t1 to l1_2), unload p1 (step10), then load again (step11) to drive to l1_8.

Alternatively, after unloading at l1_2, p1 is in l1_2 (constraint4 met). Then to get it to l1_8, we need to load into a truck again. But t1 is already in l1_2 after step9, so can load p1 again.

But this requires two steps (unload and load again). But maybe there's a way to do it more efficiently.

But perhaps that's unavoidable.

Now, considering the constraints, all must be met in at least one state. Let's verify:

- Constraint3: p1 in a1 or a2. This occurs when p1 is loaded into a2 (step4) or a1 (step16).

- Constraint4: p1 in l1_2. This occurs after step10.

- Constraint2: p1 in l1_8 after step13.

- Constraint1: p2 in l1_3 after step4 of p2's plan.

- Constraint5: p2 in t1 during step2 of p2's plan.

Now, the total steps for p1's plan are 21 steps, and for p2's plan 7 steps, but they can be interleaved. Let's see:

But some steps must be ordered. For example, p1's step7 (drive t1 to l1_1) would interfere with p2's steps if t1 is being used for both. So we need to sequence the steps where t1 is used for p2 before using it for p1.

Wait, in the p1 plan, t1 is used starting from step7 (drive to l1_1), but in p2's plan, t1 is used in steps1-7. So perhaps we need to handle p2's steps first, then use t1 for p1's steps.

Alternatively, maybe after moving p2, we can use t1 for p1.

Let me try to outline a possible sequence:

First, handle p2's steps:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1

2. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (constraint5)

3. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1

4. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (constraint1)

5. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

6. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1

7. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

Now, p2 is back to original location.

Then handle p1's steps:

But after step7 for p2, t1 is in l1_2. So when p1's step7 requires driving t1 from l1_3 to l1_1, but after p2's steps, t1 is in l1_2. So need to adjust:

Wait, in the p1 steps, step7 is drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1. But after p2's steps, t1 is in l1_2. So that won't work. Therefore, we need to adjust the order.

Alternatively, handle p1's steps first up to a point where t1 is not needed, then handle p2's steps. But that might not be possible.

This suggests that the initial approach may have ordering issues. Let's rethink.

Alternative approach:

Since the goal requires p1 and p2 to end up in their original locations, but during the plan, they must visit certain locations.

Perhaps the optimal plan is to have p2 loaded into t1 (meets constraint5), driven to l1_3 (meets constraint1), then unloaded, then loaded back and driven to l1_2.

For p1, we need to move it to l1_8 (constraint2), which requires moving it to c1. To do that, we can use a2 to fly it to l1_1, then use t1 to drive to l1_8. But during this process, p1 will be in a2 (constraint3) and in l1_2 (if we pass through there), but constraint4 requires p1 to be in l1_2 at some point. So perhaps after flying to l1_1, use t1 to drive through l1_2 to l1_8.

Let's outline this:

For p1:

1. Load p1 into t2 (l2_4)

   loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

2. Drive t2 to l2_1 (airport)

   drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2

3. Unload p1 at l2_1

   unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

4. Load into a2

   loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

5. Fly a2 to l1_1

   flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

6. Unload p1 at l1_1

   unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

7. Now, need to move p1 to l1_2 and l1_8.

   Use t1. Initially, t1 is in l1_3. So drive t1 to l1_1.

   drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1

8. Load p1 into t1

   loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

9. Drive to l1_2

   drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1

10. Unload p1 here (constraint4)

   unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2

11. Load p1 back into t1

   loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2

12. Drive to l1_8

   drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_8 c1

13. Unload (constraint2)

   unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_8

14. Now, bring p1 back to l2_4.

   Drive t1 back to l1_1.

   drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_1 c1

15. Unload p1

   unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

16. Load into a1 (assuming a1 is at l1_1)

   loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

17. Fly to l2_1

   flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

18. Unload p1

   unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

19. Load into t2

   loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

20. Drive to l2_4

   drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2

21. Unload p1

   unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

For p2:

1. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_2

   drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1

2. Load p2 into t1

   loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (constraint5)

3. Drive to l1_3

   drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1

4. Unload p2 (constraint1)

   unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

5. Load p2 back into t1

   loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

6. Drive back to l1_2

   drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1

7. Unload p2

   unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

Now, the problem is that steps for p1 and p2 both use t1, so they must be ordered. For example, steps for p1's plan involving t1 (steps7-15) must happen either before or after p2's steps (1-7). But since after p2's steps, t1 is in l1_2, but p1's steps7 requires t1 to be in l1_3 initially.

So perhaps the correct order is to first handle p2's steps (using t1), then handle p1's steps (using t1 again).

But in that case, after p2's steps, t1 is in l1_2. So when p1's steps7 requires driving from l1_3, which is not possible because t1 is in l1_2. Therefore, this approach won't work.

Alternative idea: Use different trucks for p1 and p2. But the only trucks available are t1 in c1 and t2 in c2. So for p1 in c2, we use t2; for p2 in c1, we use t1.

But when moving p1 to c1, after flying to l1_1, we need to use a truck in c1, which is t1. But if t1 is being used for p2, there's a conflict.

Therefore, perhaps we need to first handle p2's steps with t1, then use t1 for p1's steps.

So the sequence would be:

1. Handle p2's steps first (steps1-7), then p1's steps (steps1-21).

But after p2's step7, t1 is in l1_2. Then p1's step7 (drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1) can't be done. So that's a problem.

Therefore, the initial plan is not feasible. We need to adjust.

Alternative approach:

After handling p2's steps, t1 is in l1_2. So perhaps for p1's steps, use t1 from l1_2.

But to get p1 from l1_1 to l1_2, we can drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1, load p1, then drive to l1_2.

Wait, after p2's steps, t1 is in l1_2. So:

For p1's steps after flying to l1_1:

7. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1.

   drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1

8. Load p1 into t1.

   loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

9. Drive to l1_2.

   drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1

10. Unload p1 here (constraint4)

11. Then proceed to l1_8.

So adjusting p1's steps:

After step6 (p1 is in l1_1):

7. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 (after p2's step7)

8. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

9. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1

10. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 (constraint4)

11. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2

12. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_8 c1

13. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_8 (constraint2)

14. drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_1 c1

15. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

16. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

17. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

18. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

19. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

20. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2

21. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

But this requires that after handling p2's steps, we move t1 from l1_2 to l1_1 to load p1.

So integrating all steps:

Plan sequence:

For p2:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1

2. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (constraint5)

3. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1

4. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (constraint1)

5. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

6. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1

7. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

For p1:

8. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

9. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2

10. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

11. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

12. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

13. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

14. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 (t1 is in l1_2 after step7)

15. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

16. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1

17. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 (constraint4)

18. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2

19. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_8 c1

20. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_8 (constraint2)

21. drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_1 c1

22. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

23. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

24. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

25. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

26. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

27. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2

28. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

But this plan has 28 actions. However, some steps may be redundant. For example, after step17, p1 is unloaded at l1_2 (constraint4 met), then loaded back into t1 (step18) to be taken to l1_8. If we instead drive from l1_2 to l1_8 without unloading, but then we wouldn't satisfy constraint4. Because constraint4 requires that at some state, p1 is in l1_2. If we unload it there, that's satisfied. So steps17 and 18 are necessary.

But perhaps there's a shorter path. For example, after flying to l1_1, use t1 to drive directly to l1_8 via l1_2. But we need to unload at l1_2 to meet constraint4.

Alternatively, drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_2, unload (constraint4), then load and drive to l1_8. That's what's done.

Now, checking constraints:

- Constraint1: p2 is in l1_3 (step4)

- Constraint2: p1 is in l1_8 (step20)

- Constraint3: p1 is in a2 (step11) and a1 (step23)

- Constraint4: p1 is in l1_2 (step17)

- Constraint5: p2 is in t1 (step2)

All constraints are met.

But is this plan optimal? Are there redundant steps?

For example, after step7, p2 is back in l1_2. So the goal is already satisfied for p2. But during the plan, the constraints are met.

For p1, the plan brings it back to l2_4. So the final state is as required.

But the plan includes a lot of steps. Can we find a shorter plan?

Alternative idea: When moving p1 to l1_8, perhaps instead of using a1 to fly back, use a2 again. Or perhaps find a way to combine some steps.

Wait, after step12 (fly a2 to l1_1), a2 is at l1_1. Then, after unloading p1 (step13), can we load p1 back into a2 and fly back to l2_1? But then, when we load p1 into a2 at l1_1, which is allowed if a2 is there. But step12 flies a2 to l1_1, so it is there. So after unloading p1 from a2 at l1_1 (step13), a2 is still in l1_1. So step23 could be loading p1 into a2 again and flying back.

But in step23, the plan uses a1. Maybe using a2 is shorter.

Let's see:

After step13, p1 is in l1_1. To fly back, use a2:

23. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

24. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1

25. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

26. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

27. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2

28. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

This saves steps compared to using a1. Because steps23-25 replace steps23-25 in the previous plan.

This would reduce the total steps from 28 to 28 (same number), but perhaps uses fewer actions.

But no, it's the same number. Hmm.

Another optimization: When moving p1 from l1_8 back to l1_1, maybe combine steps21 and22.

After step20 (unload at l1_8), drive t1 back to l1_1 (step21), unload (step22). But if p1 is already in l1_8, perhaps we can load it into a truck and drive directly, but that's what's already done.

Another idea: Maybe after step17 (unload at l1_2), instead of loading back into t1 and driving to l1_8, can we use a different truck? But there's only t1 in c1. So no.

Alternatively, maybe after step17, drive t1 to l1_8 without loading p1 again. But p1 is in l1_2, so you can't drive it unless it's loaded. So step18 is necessary.

Thus, this seems to be the minimal steps required.

But the problem states that the plan must be optimal, i.e., the shortest possible. Let's count the steps:

For p2: 7 steps.

For p1: 21 steps.

Combined and ordered: 28 steps. But perhaps some steps can be interleaved to reduce the total.

For example, steps for p1 and p2 that don't involve the same resources can be done in parallel, but since the plan is a sequence, some steps can be ordered optimally.

For example:

After p2's step7 (unload p2 in l1_2), then start p1's steps.

But during p1's steps, can we perform some actions while p2's steps are being done?

Alternatively, perhaps we can interleave some steps.

For example, after p2's step7 (which leaves t1 in l1_2), p1's steps can start using t1 for moving to l1_1. But during the time when p1 is being moved via airplane, p2's steps can be done.

But this requires careful ordering.

Alternatively, here's a possible shorter plan:

1. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

2. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2

3. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

4. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

5. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

6. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

7. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1 (p2's step1)

8. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (p2's step2)

9. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1 (p2's step3)

10. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (p2's step4)

11. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (p2's step5)

12. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1 (p2's step6)

13. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (p2's step7)

14. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 (p1's step7)

15. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (p1's step8)

16. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1 (p1's step9)

17. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 (p1's step10)

18. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 (p1's step11)

19. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_8 c1 (p1's step12)

20. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_8 (p1's step13)

21. drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_1 c1 (p1's step14)

22. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (p1's step15)

23. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (p1's step16 using a2 instead of a1)

24. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1 (p1's step17)

25. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (p1's step18)

26. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (p1's step19)

27. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2 (p1's step20)

28. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (p1's step21)

This plan has 28 actions. But is there a way to reduce it?

For example, after step13 (p2 is back in l1_2), can we use t1 for p1's steps immediately.

But in step14, t1 is driven to l1_1, which is allowed.

Another optimization: Maybe after step5 (fly a2 to l1_1), unload p1, then a2 is at l1_1. Later, when we need to fly p1 back, use a2 again instead of a1. That saves using a1. Which is done in steps23-25.

Another thing to check: When we load p1 into a2 at l1_1 (step23), we need to ensure a2 is there. After step5, a2 is at l1_1. After step24, it's at l2_1.

But in step23, after step22 (unload p1 at l1_1), a2 is at l1_1 (from step5, fly to l1_1 and then stays there unless moved. Wait, after step5, a2 flies to l1_1. Then step6 unloads p1 from a2 at l1_1. So a2 is still at l1_1. Then, when we load p1 into a2 in step23, a2 is there. So step24 flies it back to l2_1.

This is possible.

So steps23-25:

23. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

24. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1

25. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

This works.

Thus, the plan is valid.

But is there a way to combine steps or reduce the number of actions?

For example, after step17 (unload p1 at l1_2), can we drive directly to l1_8 without loading again?

No, because p1 is unloaded at l1_2 and must be loaded into t1 to be moved.

Another idea: When moving p1 back from l1_8 to l1_1, could we fly it directly from l1_8? But l1_8 is not an airport. So no. Must use truck to get to an airport.

Thus, the plan seems to be the shortest possible. 28 steps.

But perhaps there's a shorter way. Let's think again.

Another approach: Since the goal is to have p1 and p2 in their original locations, maybe some constraints can be met by moving p1 and p2 to the required locations and then immediately bringing them back, thus minimizing steps.

For example, for p2:

- Load into t1 (constraint5), drive to l1_3 (constraint1), unload, then immediately load and drive back.

This takes 5 steps for p2:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1

2. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

3. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1

4. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

5. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

6. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1

7. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

But this is 7 steps. Is there a shorter way?

Alternatively, after unloading at l1_3, maybe not reloading and just leaving p2 there, but then the goal requires p2 to be back in l1_2. So that's not acceptable. Must return p2 to l1_2.

Thus, the 7 steps are necessary.

For p1:

The main steps are moving it to l1_8 and back. Let's see:

- Load into t2, drive to l2_1, fly to l1_1, then truck to l1_8 and back.

But maybe the steps can be optimized.

For example, after flying to l1_1, use t1 to drive directly to l1_8, passing through l1_2. But must unload in l1_2 to meet constraint4.

Alternatively:

- Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_2, unload (constraint4), then load and drive to l1_8.

Yes, that's what's done.

But perhaps after driving to l1_8 and unloading, we can fly p1 back from l1_8. But l1_8 is not an airport. So must drive back to l1_1.

Thus, steps are necessary.

Another idea: After unloading at l1_8, can we load into a different truck? No, only t1 is available in c1.

Thus, the plan seems to be as short as possible.

So the final plan would be the sequence of 28 steps as outlined earlier.

But wait, the problem requires that the initial state has "Package a1 is in location l1_1" and "Package a2 is in location l2_1". Wait, again, these are airplanes, not packages. So the user probably meant "Airplane a1 is in l1_1" and "Airplane a2 is in l2_1". So that's correct.

Thus, the plan is valid.
