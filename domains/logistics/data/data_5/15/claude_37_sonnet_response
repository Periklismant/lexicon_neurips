Alright, let me analyze this problem carefully.

We have two cities, c1 and c2, with 5 locations each. In each city, the location l1_1 (for c1) and l2_1 (for c2) are airports. We have two packages, p1 and p2, which need to be moved to specific locations. We have two trucks, t1 and t2, and two airplanes, a1 and a2, to help us with this task.

Let's first identify the initial state:
- Location l1_1 is in city c1 (this is the airport of c1)
- Location l1_2 is in city c1
- Location l1_3 is in city c1
- Location l1_4 is in city c1
- Location l1_5 is in city c1
- Location l2_1 is in city c2 (this is the airport of c2)
- Location l2_2 is in city c2
- Location l2_3 is in city c2
- Location l2_4 is in city c2
- Location l2_5 is in city c2
- Package t1 is in location l1_2 (I think there's a mistake here, t1 is a truck, not a package. I assume that Truck t1 is in location l1_2)
- Package t2 is in location l2_2 (I think there's a mistake here, t2 is a truck, not a package. I assume that Truck t2 is in location l2_2)
- Package p1 is in location l2_2 (This means that package p1 is in city c2 at location l2_2)
- Package p2 is in location l1_2 (This means that package p2 is in city c1 at location l1_2)
- Package a1 is in location l1_1 (I think there's a mistake here, a1 is an airplane, not a package. I assume that Airplane a1 is in location l1_1)
- Package a2 is in location l2_1 (I think there's a mistake here, a2 is an airplane, not a package. I assume that Airplane a2 is in location l2_1)

So the actual initial state is:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_2 (city c1)
- Truck t2 is in location l2_2 (city c2)
- Package p1 is in location l2_2 (city c2)
- Package p2 is in location l1_2 (city c1)
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (airport of city c1)
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1 (airport of city c2)

The goal is to have:
- Package p1 is in location l2_5 (city c2)
- Package p2 is in location l2_4 (city c2)

Additionally, there are several constraints that must be satisfied:

1. At least one of the following conditions must be true at some state:
   - Package p2 is in location l1_4 (city c1)
   - Package p1 is in location l2_1 (airport of city c2)

2. Package p2 must be in location l1_1 (airport of city c1) at some state.

3. If package p2 is in location l1_1, then at that state or at some state after it, at least one of the following must be true:
   - Package p1 is in location l1_5 (city c1)
   - Package p2 is in location l2_3 (city c2)

4. Package p2 must be in location l2_1 (airport of city c2) at some state.

5. If package p2 is in location l2_1, then there must be an earlier state where at least one of the following is true:
   - Package p2 is in location l1_3 (city c1)
   - Package p2 is in location l2_2 (city c2)

6. Package p2 must be in location l1_5 (city c1) at some state.

7. Package p1 must be in truck t1 at some state.

Let me think about a plan that satisfies all these constraints and achieves the goal:

First, let's consider the locations of the packages in the initial state:
- Package p1 is in location l2_2 (city c2)
- Package p2 is in location l1_2 (city c1)

For package p1, we need to move it to location l2_5 in city c2. Since it's already in city c2, we just need to use truck t2 to transport it within the city.

For package p2, we need to move it to location l2_4 in city c2. Since it's currently in city c1, we need to use a combination of trucks and airplanes to transport it to city c2 and then to its final destination.

Now, let's consider the constraints:

Constraint 5 states that before package p2 is in location l2_1 (airport of city c2), it must be in either location l1_3 or l2_2. Since p2 starts in l1_2, we can move it to l1_3 to satisfy this constraint.

Constraint 6 states that package p2 must be in location l1_5 at some state. This means we need to take p2 to l1_5 before its final destination.

Constraint 2 states that package p2 must be in location l1_1 (airport of city c1) at some state. This fits naturally with our plan to transport p2 from city c1 to city c2.

Constraint 3 states that after p2 is in location l1_1, either p1 should be in l1_5 or p2 should be in l2_3. Since p2 needs to be in l1_5 at some point (Constraint 6), we can ensure that p1 is in l1_5 after p2 is in l1_1.

Constraint 4 states that package p2 must be in location l2_1 (airport of city c2) at some state. This fits naturally with our plan to transport p2 from city c1 to city c2.

Constraint 7 states that package p1 must be in truck t1 at some state. For this, we need to bring truck t1 to package p1 (or vice versa) at some point.

Constraint 1 states that at some state, either p2 should be in l1_4 or p1 should be in l2_1. We can make sure p2 passes through l1_4 during its journey to satisfy this.

Now, let's outline a rough plan step by step:

Step 1: Move truck t2 to pick up package p1 from location l2_2 in city c2.
Step 2: Move truck t1 to pick up package p2 from location l1_2 in city c1.
Step 3: Transport package p2 to location l1_3 (to satisfy constraint 5).
Step 4: Transport package p2 to location l1_4 (to satisfy constraint 1).
Step 5: Transport package p2 to location l1_5 (to satisfy constraint 6).
Step 6: Transport package p2 to location l1_1 (the airport of city c1) (to satisfy constraint 2).
Step 7: Transport package p1 to somewhere (not sure yet, based on constraints).
Step 8: Load package p2 onto airplane a1 or a2 at location l1_1.
Step 9: Fly the airplane to location l2_1 (the airport of city c2) (to satisfy constraint 4).
Step 10: Unload package p2 from the airplane at location l2_1.
Step 11: Move truck t2 to pick up package p2 from location l2_1.
Step 12: Transport package p2 to location l2_3 (to satisfy constraint 3, if needed).
Step 13: Transport package p2 to its final destination l2_4.
Step 14: Transport package p1 to its final destination l2_5.

At some point, we also need to satisfy constraint 7 by having package p1 in truck t1.

Let me refine this plan to make it more concrete.

First, I notice that the location of the packages and vehicles in the initial state seems wrong. It says "Package t1", "Package t2", "Package a1", "Package a2", which is inconsistent with the domain description where t1 and t2 are trucks, and a1 and a2 are airplanes.

Let me restate the initial state using my best understanding:

- Truck t1 is in location l1_2 (city c1)
- Truck t2 is in location l2_2 (city c2)
- Package p1 is in location l2_2 (city c2)
- Package p2 is in location l1_2 (city c1)
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (airport of city c1)
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1 (airport of city c2)

I'll proceed with this understanding.

Now, let's start constructing a detailed plan:

1. Truck t1 picks up package p2 from location l1_2 in city c1:
   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

2. Truck t1 drives to location l1_3 in city c1 (to satisfy the first part of constraint 5):
   - drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1

3. Truck t1 drives to location l1_4 in city c1 (to satisfy the first part of constraint 1):
   - drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1

4. Truck t1 drives to location l1_5 in city c1 (to satisfy constraint 6):
   - drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1

5. Truck t1 drives to location l1_1 (the airport of city c1) (to satisfy constraint 2):
   - drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1

6. Unload package p2 from truck t1 at location l1_1:
   - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

7. Truck t2 picks up package p1 from location l2_2 in city c2:
   - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

8. Truck t2 drives to location l1_1 in city c1:
   Wait, that's not possible. Truck t2 is in city c2 and can't drive directly to city c1.
   Actually, trucks can only move within a city, so we need a different approach.

Let me rethink this plan...

Given the constraints, here's a more feasible approach:

1. Truck t2 picks up package p1 from location l2_2 in city c2:
   - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

2. Truck t2 drives to location l2_1 (the airport of city c2):
   - drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2

3. Unload package p1 from truck t2 at location l2_1:
   - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

4. Airplane a2 picks up package p1 from location l2_1:
   - loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

5. Airplane a2 flies to location l1_1 (the airport of city c1):
   - flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

6. Unload package p1 from airplane a2 at location l1_1:
   - unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

7. Truck t1 drives to location l1_1 (the airport of city c1):
   - drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1

8. Truck t1 picks up package p1 from location l1_1 (to satisfy constraint 7):
   - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

9. Truck t1 drives to location l1_5 in city c1 (to satisfy the first part of constraint 3):
   - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1

10. Unload package p1 from truck t1 at location l1_5:
    - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5

11. Truck t1 drives to location l1_2 in city c1:
    - drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_2 c1

12. Truck t1 picks up package p2 from location l1_2 in city c1:
    - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

13. Truck t1 drives to location l1_3 in city c1 (to satisfy the first part of constraint 5):
    - drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1

14. Truck t1 drives to location l1_4 in city c1 (to satisfy the first part of constraint 1):
    - drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1

15. Truck t1 drives to location l1_5 in city c1 (to satisfy constraint 6):
    - drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1

16. Truck t1 drives to location l1_1 (the airport of city c1) (to satisfy constraint 2):
    - drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1

17. Unload package p2 from truck t1 at location l1_1:
    - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

18. Airplane a2 picks up package p2 from location l1_1:
    - loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

19. Airplane a2 flies to location l2_1 (the airport of city c2) (to satisfy constraint 4):
    - flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1

20. Unload package p2 from airplane a2 at location l2_1:
    - unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

21. Truck t2 drives to location l2_1 (the airport of city c2):
    - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_1 c2

22. Truck t2 picks up package p2 from location l2_1:
    - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

23. Truck t2 drives to location l2_3 in city c2 (to satisfy the second part of constraint 3):
    - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2

24. Truck t2 drives to location l2_4 in city c2 (the final destination for package p2):
    - drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2

25. Unload package p2 from truck t2 at location l2_4:
    - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

26. Truck t2 drives to location l1_1 in city c1:
    Wait, that's not possible. Truck t2 is in city c2 and can't drive directly to city c1. I need to reconsider.

27. Airplane a2 flies back to location l1_1:
    - flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

28. Airplane a2 picks up package p1 from location l1_5:
    Wait, this doesn't make sense. Package p1 is in l1_5 but airplane a2 is in l1_1. We need to bring them together.

Let me rethink this plan again, making sure that all the constraints are satisfied and the goal is achieved.

Actually, let's first revisit the constraints and organize them in a way that helps us plan better:

1. At some state, either package p2 should be in location l1_4 or package p1 should be in location l2_1.
2. Package p2 must be in location l1_1 at some state (the airport of city c1).
3. After package p2 is in location l1_1, either package p1 should be in location l1_5 or package p2 should be in location l2_3.
4. Package p2 must be in location l2_1 at some state (the airport of city c2).
5. Before package p2 is in location l2_1, it must be in either location l1_3 or l2_2.
6. Package p2 must be in location l1_5 at some state.
7. Package p1 must be in truck t1 at some state.

Given these constraints, here's a plan that should work:

1. Truck t1 picks up package p2 from location l1_2 in city c1:
   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

2. Truck t1 drives to location l1_3 in city c1 (to satisfy the first part of constraint 5):
   - drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1

3. Truck t1 drives to location l1_4 in city c1 (to satisfy the first part of constraint 1):
   - drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1

4. Truck t1 drives to location l1_5 in city c1 (to satisfy constraint 6):
   - drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1

   - drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1

6. Unload package p2 from truck t1 at location l1_1:
   - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

9. Truck t1 drives to location l1_4:
   - drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1

10. Truck t1 drives to location l1_5:
    - drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1

11. Truck t2 picks up package p1 from location l2_2 in city c2:
    - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

12. Truck t2 drives to location l2_1 (the airport of city c2) (to satisfy the second part of constraint 1):
    - drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2

13. Unload package p1 from truck t2 at location l2_1:
    - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

14. Airplane a2 picks up package p1 from location l2_1:
    - loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

15. Airplane a2 flies to location l1_1 (the airport of city c1):
    - flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

16. Unload package p1 from airplane a2 at location l1_1:
    - unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

17. Truck t1 drives to location l1_1:
    - drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1

18. Load package p1 into truck t1 at location l1_1 (to satisfy constraint 7):
    - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

19. Truck t1 drives to location l1_5 (to satisfy the first part of constraint 3):
    - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1

20. Unload package p1 from truck t1 at location l1_5:
    - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5

21. Truck t1 drives to location l1_1:
    - drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1

22. Airplane a1 picks up package p2 from location l1_1:
    - loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

23. Airplane a1 flies to location l2_1 (the airport of city c2) (to satisfy constraint 4):
    - flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

24. Unload package p2 from airplane a1 at location l2_1:
    - unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

25. Truck t2 drives to location l2_1:
    - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_1 c2

26. Truck t2 picks up package p2 from location l2_1:
    - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

27. Truck t2 drives to location l2_3 (to satisfy the second part of constraint 3):
    - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2

28. Truck t2 drives to location l2_4 (the final destination for package p2):
    - drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2

29. Unload package p2 from truck t2 at location l2_4:
    - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

30. Airplane a2 flies to location l2_1:
    - flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1

31. Airplane a2 picks up package p1 from location l1_5:
    Wait, this doesn't work. Package p1 is in location l1_5 (city c1), but airplane a2 is in location l2_1 (city c2). 

Let me rethink this part of the plan. 

Wait, I need to transport package p1 from location l1_5 to its final destination l2_5. Since package p1 is in city c1, I need to use an airplane to transport it to city c2.

Let me continue the plan:

31. Truck t1 picks up package p1 from location l1_5:
    - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5

32. Truck t1 drives to location l1_1 (the airport of city c1):
    - drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1

33. Unload package p1 from truck t1 at location l1_1:
    - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

34. Airplane a1 flies back to location l1_1:
    - flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1

35. Airplane a1 picks up package p1 from location l1_1:
    - loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

36. Airplane a1 flies to location l2_1 (the airport of city c2):
    - flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

37. Unload package p1 from airplane a1 at location l2_1:
    - unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

38. Truck t2 drives to location l2_1:
    - drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2

39. Truck t2 picks up package p1 from location l2_1:
    - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

40. Truck t2 drives to location l2_5 (the final destination for package p1):
    - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2

41. Unload package p1 from truck t2 at location l2_5:
    - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

This plan should satisfy all the constraints and achieve the goal:
- Constraint 1: Package p2 is in location l1_4 at some state (step 3) and package p1 is in location l2_1 at some state (step 13).
- Constraint 2: Package p2 is in location l1_1 at some state (step 6).
- Constraint 3: After package p2 is in location l1_1 (step 6), package p1 is in location l1_5 (step 20) and package p2 is in location l2_3 (step 27).
- Constraint 4: Package p2 is in location l2_1 at some state (step 24).
- Constraint 5: Before package p2 is in location l2_1 (step 24), it is in location l1_3 (step 2).
- Constraint 6: Package p2 is in location l1_5 at some state (step 4).
- Constraint 7: Package p1 is in truck t1 at some state (step 18).

Oh, wait, I notice there's a bit of a loop in the plan where I'm moving truck t1 back and forth to location l1_1. Let me optimize this.

Also, I notice that step 25 has truck t2 driving from location l2_1 to location l2_1, which is unnecessary.

Let me provide an updated, optimized plan:

1. Truck t1 picks up package p2 from location l1_2 in city c1:
   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

2. Truck t1 drives to location l1_3 in city c1 (to satisfy the first part of constraint 5):
   - drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1

   - drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1

   - drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1

   - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

10. Airplane a2 picks up package p1 from location l2_1:
    - loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

11. Airplane a2 flies to location l1_1 (the airport of city c1):
    - flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

12. Unload package p1 from airplane a2 at location l1_1:
    - unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

13. Truck t1 picks up package p1 from location l1_1 (to satisfy constraint 7):
    - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

14. Truck t1 drives to location l1_5 (to satisfy the first part of constraint 3):
    - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1

15. Unload package p1 from truck t1 at location l1_5:
    - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5

16. Truck t1 drives back to location l1_1:
    - drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1

17. Airplane a1 picks up package p2 from location l1_1:
    - loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

18. Airplane a1 flies to location l2_1 (the airport of city c2) (to satisfy constraint 4):
    - flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

19. Unload package p2 from airplane a1 at location l2_1:
    - unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

20. Truck t2 picks up package p2 from location l2_1:
    - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

21. Truck t2 drives to location l2_3 (to satisfy the second part of constraint 3):
    - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2

22. Truck t2 drives to location l2_4 (the final destination for package p2):
    - drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2

23. Unload package p2 from truck t2 at location l2_4:
    - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

24. Truck t1 picks up package p1 from location l1_5:
    - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5

25. Truck t1 drives to location l1_1 (the airport of city c1):
    - drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1

26. Unload package p1 from truck t1 at location l1_1:
    - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

27. Airplane a1 flies back to location l1_1:
    - flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1

28. Airplane a1 picks up package p1 from location l1_1:
    - loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

29. Airplane a1 flies to location l2_1 (the airport of city c2):
    - flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

30. Unload package p1 from airplane a1 at location l2_1:
    - unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

31. Truck t2 drives back to location l2_1:
    - drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2

32. Truck t2 picks up package p1 from location l2_1:
    - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

33. Truck t2 drives to location l2_5 (the final destination for package p1):
    - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2

34. Unload package p1 from truck t2 at location l2_5:
    - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

Alright, I think this plan satisfies all the constraints and achieves the goal. Let's check once more:

At the end of this plan, package p1 is in location l2_5 and package p2 is in location l2_4, which is the goal.

- Constraint 1: Package p2 is in location l1_4 at step 3 and package p1 is in location l2_1 at step 9.
- Constraint 2: Package p2 is in location l1_1 at step 6.
- Constraint 3: After package p2 is in location l1_1 (step 6), package p1 is in location l1_5 (step 15) and package p2 is in location l2_3 (step 21).
- Constraint 4: Package p2 is in location l2_1 at step 19.
- Constraint 5: Before package p2 is in location l2_1 (step 19), it is in location l1_3 (step 2).
- Constraint 6: Package p2 is in location l1_5 at step 4.
- Constraint 7: Package p1 is in truck t1 at step 13 and step 24.

Wait, I see a possible optimization. Instead of steps 24-34, we could have airplane a2 just pick up package p1 from location l1_5, fly it to l2_1, and then use truck t2 to transport it to l2_5. Let me try to simplify the plan:

1. Truck t1 picks up package p2 from location l1_2 in city c1:
   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

2. Truck t1 drives to location l1_3 in city c1 (to satisfy the first part of constraint 5):
   - drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1

3. Truck t1 drives to location l1_4 in city c1 (to satisfy the first part of constraint 1):
   - drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1

4. Truck t1 drives to location l1_5 in city c1 (to satisfy constraint 6):
   - drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1

5. Truck t1 drives to location l1_1 (the airport of city c1) (to satisfy constraint 2):
   - drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1

6. Unload package p2 from truck t1 at location l1_1:
   - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

7. Truck t2 picks up package p1 from location l2_2 in city c2:
   - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

8. Truck t2 drives to location l2_1 (the airport of city c2) (to satisfy the second part of constraint 1):
   - drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2

9. Unload package p1 from truck t2 at location l2_1:
   - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

10. Airplane a2 picks up package p1 from location l2_1:
    - loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

11. Airplane a2 flies to location l1_1 (the airport of city c1):
    - flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

12. Unload package p1 from airplane a2 at location l1_1:
    - unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

13. Truck t1 picks up package p1 from location l1_1 (to satisfy constraint 7):
    - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

14. Truck t1 drives to location l1_5 (to satisfy the first part of constraint 3):
    - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1

15. Unload package p1 from truck t1 at location l1_5:
    - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5

16. Airplane a1 picks up package p2 from location l1_1:
    - loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

17. Airplane a1 flies to location l2_1 (the airport of city c2) (to satisfy constraint 4):
    - flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

18. Unload package p2 from airplane a1 at location l2_1:
    - unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

19. Truck t2 picks up package p2 from location l2_1:
    - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

20. Truck t2 drives to location l2_3 (to satisfy the second part of constraint 3):
    - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2

21. Truck t2 drives to location l2_4 (the final destination for package p2):
    - drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2

22. Unload package p2 from truck t2 at location l2_4:
    - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

23. Airplane a2 flies back to location l1_5:
    Wait, airplanes can only land at airports. So airplane a2 can only fly to l1_1, not l1_5. It's confusing because I'm forgetting of the preconditions of the "flyairplane" action.

Actually, p1 needs to be transported to l2_5. Let me try again for the last part of the plan:

23. Airplane a2 flies back to location l1_1:
    - flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

24. Truck t1 picks up package p1 from location l1_5:
    - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5

25. Truck t1 drives to location l1_1:
    - drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1

26. Unload package p1 from truck t1 at location l1_1:
    - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

27. Airplane a2 picks up package p1 from location l1_1:
    - loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

28. Airplane a2 flies to location l2_1:
    - flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1

29. Unload package p1 from airplane a2 at location l2_1:
    - unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

30. Truck t2 drives from location l2_4 to location l2_1:
    - drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2

31. Truck t2 picks up package p1 from location l2_1:
    - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

32. Truck t2 drives to location l2_5:
    - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2

33. Unload package p1 from truck t2 at location l2_5:
    - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

Okay, this plan should be optimal and satisfy all the constraints:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
2. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1
3. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1
4. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1
5. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
6. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
7. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
8. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
9. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
10. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
11. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
12. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
13. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
14. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
15. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
16. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
17. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
18. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
19. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
20. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
21. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
22. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
23. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
24. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
25. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
26. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
27. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
28. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
29. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
30. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
31. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
32. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
33. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

Wait, there's a problem with this plan. I'm trying to have airplane a2 fly back to location l2_1 in step 23, but I've already flown it to location l1_1 in step 11. I need to update the plan to account for the current location of airplane a2.

Actually, there's another issue with the plan. In step 16, I'm having airplane a1 pick up package p2 from location l1_1, but I need to ensure that airplane a1 is at location l1_1. Let me fix these issues:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
2. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1
3. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1
4. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1
5. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
6. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
7. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
8. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
9. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
10. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
11. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
12. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
13. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
14. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
15. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
16. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
17. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
18. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
19. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
20. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
21. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
22. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
23. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
24. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
25. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
26. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
27. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
28. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
29. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
30. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
31. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
32. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
33. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
34. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
35. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
36. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

Actually, I notice I got confused the the "steps" in my plan when I wrote it out. Let me rewrite the plan again to be sure:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
2. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1
3. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1
4. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1
5. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
6. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
7. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
8. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
9. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
10. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
11. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
12. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
13. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
14. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
15. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
16. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
17. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
18. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
19. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
20. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
21. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
22. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
23. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
24. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
25. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
26. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
27. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
MISTAKE: Airplane a2 is in l2_1, but package p1 is in l1_1, so I can't load package p1 into airplane a2.

Let me redo this part:
27. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
28. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
29. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
30. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
31. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
32. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
33. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

Wait, now I realize I mistake I made: I'm trying to load p1 into truck t1 at l1_5 (step 24), but truck t1 is at l1_1 after step 17. Let me carefully trace the locations of all objects through the plan to make sure it's consistent.

Starting state:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_2 (city c1)
- Truck t2 is in location l2_2 (city c2)
- Package p1 is in location l2_2 (city c2)
- Package p2 is in location l1_2 (city c1)
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (airport of city c1)

    - p1 is now in t1
    - t1 is in l1_1

    - t1 (with p1) is now in l1_5

15. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
    - p1 is now in l1_5
    - t1 is in l1_5

    - t1 is now in l1_1

17. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
    - p2 is now in a1
    - a1 is in l1_1

18. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
    - a1 (with p2) is now in l2_1

19. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
    - p2 is now in l2_1
    - a1 is in l2_1

20. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
    - p2 is now in t2
    - t2 is in l2_1

21. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
    - t2 (with p2) is now in l2_3

22. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
    - t2 (with p2) is now in l2_4

23. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
    - p2 is now in l2_4
    - t2 is in l2_4

24. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
    - a2 is now in l2_1

25. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
    - t2 is now in l2_1

26. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
    - a1 is now in l1_1

27. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
    - t1 is now in l1_5

28. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
    - p1 is now in t1
    - t1 is in l1_5

29. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
    - t1 (with p1) is now in l1_1

30. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
    - p1 is now in l1_1
    - t1 is in l1_1

31. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
    - p1 is now in a1
    - a1 is in l1_1

32. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
    - a1 (with p1) is now in l2_1

33. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
    - p1 is now in l2_1
    - a1 is in l2_1

34. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
    - p1 is now in t2
    - t2 is in l2_1

35. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
    - t2 (with p1) is now in l2_5

36. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
    - p1 is now in l2_5
    - t2 is in l2_5

Final state:
- Package p1 is in location l2_5
- Package p2 is in location l2_4

This plan does have a lot of intermediate states, but I've verified that at each step, the preconditions of the actions are satisfied. It also satisfies all the constraints in the problem.

However, let me see if I can optimize the plan further.

Actually, I notice that in the late half of the plan, after step 23, I'm just moving package p1 from l1_5 to l2_5. I'm not sure if all the intermediate steps (like flying a1 to l1_1, etc.) are necessary. Let me try to simplify that part:

23. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
    - a2 is now in l2_1

24. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
    - t1 is now in l1_5

25. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
    - p1 is now in t1
    - t1 is in l1_5

26. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
    - t1 (with p1) is now in l1_1

27. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
    - p1 is now in l1_1
    - t1 is in l1_1

28. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
MISTAKE: Airplane a2 is in l2_1, but package p1 is in l1_1, so I can't load package p1 into airplane a2.

Let me try a different approach:

23. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
    - t1 is now in l1_5

24. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
    - p1 is now in t1
    - t1 is in l1_5

25. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
    - t1 (with p1) is now in l1_1

26. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
    - p1 is now in l1_1
    - t1 is in l1_1

27. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
    - a1 is now in l1_1

28. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
    - p1 is now in a1
    - a1 is in l1_1

29. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
    - a1 (with p1) is now in l2_1

30. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
    - p1 is now in l2_1
    - a1 is in l2_1

31. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
    - p1 is now in t2
    - t2 is in l2_1

32. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
    - t2 (with p1) is now in l2_5

33. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
    - p1 is now in l2_5
    - t2 is in l2_5

I think this is cleaner. Now let's integrate this into the full plan:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
2. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1
3. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1
4. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1
5. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
6. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
7. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
8. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
9. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
10. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
11. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
12. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
13. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
14. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
15. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
16. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
17. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
18. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
19. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
20. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
21. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
22. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
23. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
24. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
25. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
26. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
27. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
28. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
29. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
30. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
31. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
32. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
33. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
34. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
35. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

Wait, I notice there is still a bit of a problem with step 25. After step 16, t1 is already at l1_1, so there's no need to move it to l1_5 and then back to l1_1.

Let's clean up the plan again:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
2. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1
3. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1
4. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1
5. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
6. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
7. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
8. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
9. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
10. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
11. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
12. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
13. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
14. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
15. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
16. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
17. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
18. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
19. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
20. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
21. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
22. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
23. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
24. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
25. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
26. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
27. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
28. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
29. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
30. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
31. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
32. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
33. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
34. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
35. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
