Okay, let's try to figure out how to solve this planning problem. So, the goal is to get package p1 to l1_2 and p2 to l1_4, right? But there are a bunch of constraints we have to satisfy along the way. Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's look at the initial state. p1 is at l1_1, which is an airport in city c1. p2 is at l2_5 in city c2. The trucks and airplanes are also at various locations. We need to move these packages to their destinations, but the constraints complicate things.

Looking at the constraints:

1. p2 must be in l2_5 at some state. But initially, p2 is already in l2_5. Wait, the original state says "Package p2 is in location l2_5". So that's already satisfied in the initial state. So the first constraint is already met. But maybe we need to ensure that after any actions, this condition holds at least once. But since it's already true, maybe that's okay. However, the second constraint says if p2 is in l2_5 in some state s, then p2 must be in l2_4 at s or after. But since the initial state has p2 in l2_5, we need to make sure that either in the initial state (which it's already there), or in some state after, p2 is in l2_4. Wait, the constraint is that if p2 is in l2_5 in a state, then p2 must be in l2_4 either at s or after. Since the initial state has p2 in l2_5, we need to have p2 in l2_4 at some point after that. So p2 has to be moved from l2_5 to l2_4 at some point. But the goal requires p2 to end up in l1_4. So maybe we need to move p2 from l2_5 to l2_4, then transport it to c1's l1_4.

Another constraint is that p2 must be in l1_4 at least once (which is the goal), but before that, p1 must be in l1_3. Also, p1 must be in a2 (the airplane) at some point, and in l2_2 (which is in city c2) at some point. Additionally, p1 must be in l1_3 at least once.

So for p1: it starts at l1_1. It needs to go to l1_2 as the goal, but along the way, it has to be in a2 (which is an airplane starting at l2_1 in city c2), and in l2_2 (which is in c2). Wait, how can p1 get into a2 and then to l2_2? That would require moving p1 from c1 to c2. Because a2 is in c2's airport l2_1. So maybe we need to fly p1 from c1 to c2, then drive it to l2_2, then bring it back to c1.

But wait, how to get p1 into a2. Let's think. The airplanes can only move between airports. So a1 is in l1_1 (c1's airport), a2 is in l2_1 (c2's airport). To load p1 into a2, p1 would have to be at l2_1. But p1 starts in l1_1. So maybe we need to use a1 to fly p1 to l2_1, load it into a2, then fly a2 somewhere else? Wait, but the airplanes can carry packages. Let's see.

First, let's handle p1's path. The constraints require p1 to be in a2, which is in c2. So p1 needs to be transported to c2. Let's outline the steps:

1. Load p1 into a1 at l1_1 (since a1 is already there).
2. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1 (c2's airport). Now p1 is in a1 at l2_1.
3. Unload p1 from a1 into l2_1.
4. Then load p1 into a2 (which is at l2_1) so that p1 is in a2.
5. Then fly a2 to l2_1's airport? Wait, maybe fly a2 to another airport. Wait, but l2_1 is already in c2. If we need to get p1 to l2_2, which is in c2, perhaps we can drive it with truck t2. But t2 is in l2_4 according to the initial state? Wait, original state says "Package t1 is in location l1_5", "Package t2 is in location l2_4". Wait, no, wait the original state says:

Wait the original state says:

"Package t1 is in location l1_5"

Wait, that must be a typo. Because t1 is a truck, not a package. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:

The world includes the following objects:

"truck t1"

"truck t2"

So the original state says:

"Package t1 is in location l1_5" — that must be a mistake. Because t1 is a truck. So perhaps it's a typo, and it should be "Truck t1 is in location l1_5". Similarly for t2. Otherwise, the problem is inconsistent because you can't load a package into a truck that's a package. So assuming that's a typo, let's proceed with the assumption that t1 is a truck in l1_5, t2 is a truck in l2_4.

Similarly, "Package a1 is in location l1_1", but a1 is an airplane. So that's probably a typo too; the correct initial state should be that a1 is in l1_1, and a2 is in l2_1.

Assuming that, the initial positions are:

- t1 (truck) is in l1_5 (c1)
- t2 (truck) is in l2_4 (c2)
- a1 (airplane) is in l1_1 (c1's airport)
- a2 (airplane) is in l2_1 (c2's airport)
- p1 is in l1_1 (c1's airport)
- p2 is in l2_5 (c2)

So for p1: need to get to l1_2 in c1. But the constraints require p1 to be in a2 (which is in c2), in l2_2 (c2), and in l1_3 (c1). Also, when p2 is in l1_4 (goal), there must be an earlier state where p1 is in l1_3.

Let's plan for p1 first.

To get p1 into a2, which is in l2_1 (c2's airport), we need to transport p1 from c1 to c2. Since airplanes can move between airports, perhaps we can use a1 to carry p1 to l2_1.

Steps for p1:

1. Load p1 into a1 at l1_1. Preconditions: p1 and a1 are at l1_1. So that's possible.
2. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1. Now a1 is at l2_1, p1 is inside a1.
3. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1. Now p1 is at l2_1.
4. Load p1 into a2 (since a2 is at l2_1). Now p1 is in a2, satisfying the constraint that p1 is in a2 at some state.
5. Then, fly a2 to l2_1's airport? Wait, no. Maybe fly a2 to another airport, but l2_1 is already in c2. Alternatively, perhaps we need to drive p1 to l2_2 using truck t2.

But t2 is initially in l2_4. So first, drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1 (if possible). Wait, cities have locations. Each city has locations. For c2, locations l2_1 (airport), l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5. So drivetruck t2 from l2_4 to l2_1, but is l2_1 in c2? Yes. So that's allowed.

So steps:

After unloading p1 at l2_1:

5. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1 (c2). Then load p1 into t2 at l2_1.
6. Drive t2 to l2_2. Then unload p1 there. Now p1 is in l2_2, satisfying that constraint.
7. Now, to get p1 back to c1. So need to fly it again. So load p1 into a2 (which is at l2_1?), wait, no, t2 is at l2_2. So perhaps drive t2 back to l2_1, then load p1 into a2 again, fly a2 to l1_1, unload, then transport to l1_3 and then to l1_2.

But this seems complicated. Let's think step by step.

Alternatively, after p1 is in l2_2 (via truck t2), we need to get it back to c1. So load p1 into a2 (if a2 is at l2_1, but how do we get p1 from l2_2 to l2_1? Maybe use truck t2 again. So drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1, then load p1 into a2, fly a2 to l1_1. Then unload p1 into l1_1, then use truck t1 (which is in l1_5) to drive to l1_1, load p1, drive to l1_3, unload (satisfying the constraint that p1 is in l1_3), then drive to l1_2 and unload.

But let's outline:

For p1's journey:

1. Load p1 into a1 at l1_1.
2. Fly a1 to l2_1.
3. Unload p1 at l2_1.
4. Load p1 into a2 at l2_1. (Now p1 is in a2, satisfying that constraint.)
5. Fly a2 to l1_1? Wait, but a2 is in c2's airport. Can airplanes fly between any airports? Yes. So fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1. Then unload p1 at l1_1. But that brings p1 back to where it started. Hmm. But then we need to get p1 to l1_2 via l1_3.

Alternatively, maybe fly a2 to l2_1's airport, but that's where it already is. Wait, maybe after p1 is in l2_2, we can fly it back.

Wait, perhaps after step 4 (p1 is in a2), fly a2 to l1_1. Then unload p1 there. But then p1 is back in l1_1. Then use truck t1 (which is in l1_5) to drive to l1_1, load p1, drive to l1_3 (unload there, satisfying the constraint), then drive to l1_2.

But that would work. Let's see:

Steps for p1:

1. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 → Wait, no. Because initially, t1 is in l1_5. So can't load p1 into t1 unless t1 is at l1_1. So first, need to drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_1.

Wait, initial state: t1 is in l1_5. So:

- Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_1 (c1). Then load p1 into t1.

Wait, but p1 is in l1_1. So:

Action: drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1.

Then, loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1.

Then drive t1 to l1_3, unload p1 there (satisfying the constraint that p1 is in l1_3). Then drive to l1_2 and unload.

But wait, the goal is to have p1 in l1_2. So that's straightforward. But why involve the airplane? Because the constraints require p1 to be in a2 (the airplane) and in l2_2 (c2). So the previous approach of using a1 to fly p1 to c2 is necessary.

So combining both:

For p1:

- Get p1 to c2 via a1.
- Then move p1 to l2_2 via truck t2.
- Then get p1 back to c1 via a2.
- Then move to l1_3 and then l1_2.

Let's outline:

1. Load p1 into a1 at l1_1: loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1. (Wait, no, loadairplane is for loading into airplanes. Wait, the action is "loadairplane p ap l": load package p into airplane ap at location l. So yes, since a1 is at l1_1, and p1 is there, we can load p1 into a1.

Action: loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1.

2. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1: flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1.

3. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1: unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1. Now p1 is at l2_1.

4. Now, need to load p1 into a2. But a2 is at l2_1, so loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1. Now p1 is in a2, satisfying the constraint.

5. Now, to get p1 to l2_2, which is in c2. So we can use truck t2. But t2 is in l2_4 initially. So first, drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.

Action: drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2.

6. Load p1 into t2 at l2_1: loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1. (But wait, p1 is in a2. So we need to unload p1 from a2 first. Wait, step 4 leaves p1 in a2. So to load into t2, we need to unload p1 from a2 into l2_1 first.

Wait, correction:

After step 4, p1 is in a2. So before loading into t2, we need to unload p1 from a2.

So step 5: unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1.

Then step 6: loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (assuming t2 is now at l2_1).

But t2 is in l2_4 initially. So step 5 (drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2) must happen before loading.

So revised steps:

4. After loading p1 into a2, we need to get t2 to l2_1.

So:

4. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2.

5. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1. (But wait, p1 was loaded into a2 in step 4? Wait, step 3 is unload from a1 to l2_1. Then step 4 is load into a2.

Wait, let's re-express:

1. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1.

2. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1.

3. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1. Now p1 is at l2_1.

4. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1. Now p1 is in a2.

5. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1. (To bring p1 back to c1. But why? Because we need to get p1 to l1_3 and then l1_2. Alternatively, maybe we can fly a2 to another airport, but the goal is in c1.)

Alternatively, after p1 is in a2, fly a2 to l2_1's airport (but it's already there). Hmm. Maybe we need to get p1 out of a2 into l2_1 again, then use truck t2 to move it to l2_2.

So:

4. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1. Now p1 is in a2.

5. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1. Now p1 is back in l2_1.

6. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2.

7. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1.

8. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2.

9. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2. Now p1 is in l2_2, satisfying that constraint.

Now, to get p1 back to c1. Since the goal is in c1, we need to transport p1 back. So:

10. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2.

11. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2.

12. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1.

13. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1.

14. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

15. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1.

Now, p1 is back at l1_1. Now, to get it to l1_2 via l1_3.

So:

16. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1.

17. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1.

18. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1.

19. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3. Now p1 is in l1_3, satisfying that constraint.

20. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1.

21. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2. Done.

But this seems very long. Let's see if there's a shorter path. But maybe this is necessary to meet all constraints.

Now, for p2. The goal is to have p2 in l1_4. The constraints for p2 are:

- Must be in l2_5 at least once (already true initially).

- If in l2_5, then must be in l2_4 at s or after. So since initial state is l2_5, we need to move p2 to l2_4 at some point.

Then, eventually to l1_4.

So p2 starts in l2_5. We need to move it to l2_4 (satisfying the constraint), then transport it to c1's l1_4.

How to move p2 from l2_5 to l2_4:

Use truck t2 (since t2 is in l2_4 initially). Wait, no, t2 starts in l2_4. So to move p2 from l2_5 to l2_4, perhaps use a truck. But in city c2, locations are l2_1 (airport), l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5. So l2_5 is in c2, so a truck can drive between them.

But t2 is in l2_4. So:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2.

2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5.

3. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2.

4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4. Now p2 is in l2_4, satisfying the constraint.

Then, to move p2 to c1. To do that, need to use an airplane. So:

5. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2 (since the airport in c2 is l2_1).

6. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1. (a2 is at l2_1.)

7. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

8. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1.

Now, p2 is in l1_1 (c1's airport). Then use truck t1 to drive to l1_4.

But t1 is in l1_5 initially. So:

9. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1.

10. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

11. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1.

12. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4. Done.

But wait, the goal is to have p2 in l1_4. So that's step 12.

But we need to check all constraints. Also, the constraint that when p2 is in l1_4, there must be an earlier state where p1 is in l1_3. So in the plan, after p1 is in l1_3 (step 19), then p2 can be moved to l1_4.

So the order of actions must be such that p1 is in l1_3 before p2 is in l1_4.

Now, combining both p1 and p2's steps, we need to interleave their actions.

But since the problem requires an optimal (shortest) plan, we need to see if we can parallelize or find a shorter path.

But given the dependencies, let's outline the combined plan:

First, handle p2's initial movement to l2_4:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2 (t2 drives to l2_5)
2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
3. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2 (now p2 is in l2_4)
4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

Now, for p2 to get to c1, we need to fly it. But we also need to handle p1's movement.

But let's see:

After step 4, p2 is in l2_4. Then, we can drive t2 to l2_1 (c2's airport) to load p2 into a2.

5. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
6. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (Wait, no. To load into airplane, we need to unload p2 from the truck and load into airplane. So after driving t2 to l2_1:

5. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2 (t2 is now at l2_1)
6. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (since p2 was loaded into t2 earlier)
7. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
8. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
9. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

Now p2 is at l1_1 in c1. Then, use truck t1 to drive to l1_4.

But t1 is in l1_5. So:

10. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
11. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
12. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
13. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (goal for p2 achieved)

But we have to ensure that this happens after p1 is in l1_3.

But according to p1's steps, p1 reaches l1_3 at step 19 (assuming we interleave the steps).

But this would require the steps for p1 to be interleaved such that p1 is in l1_3 before p2 is in l1_4.

So let's integrate the steps.

But this is getting complex. Let's try to create a timeline.

Alternative approach: Since the constraints require that when p2 is in l1_4, there's an earlier state where p1 is in l1_3. So the unloading of p2 to l1_4 (step 13) must come after p1's step of being unloaded at l1_3 (step 19).

But how can we arrange that?

Perhaps:

- First handle p1's journey to c2 and back, then handle p2's movement.

But that might not be optimal.

Alternatively, we can interleave actions for p1 and p2 to minimize steps.

But this requires careful planning.

Let's attempt to outline the entire plan step by step, considering both packages:

1. For p1: Load into a1 at l1_1.
   Action: loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

2. Fly a1 to l2_1.
   Action: flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

3. Unload p1 from a1 to l2_1.
   Action: unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

4. Load p1 into a2 at l2_1.
   Action: loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

5. Fly a2 to l1_1 to bring p1 back? Or use another approach. Wait, need to get p1 into l2_2.

But for p1 to get to l2_2:

5. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_5 to load p2 (as part of p2's steps). Wait, no, let's handle p2 first.

But maybe we need to handle both packages' steps in parallel.

Alternative plan:

Handling p2 first:

1. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_5 (to load p2).
   Action: drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2

2. Load p2 into t2.
   Action: loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5

3. Drive t2 back to l2_4.
   Action: drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2

4. Unload p2 at l2_4.
   Action: unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

Now, p2 is in l2_4, satisfying the constraint that after being in l2_5, it's in l2_4.

Then, to transport p2 to c1:

5. Drive t2 to l2_1.
   Action: drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2

6. Load p2 into a2.
   Action: loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

7. Fly a2 to l1_1.
   Action: flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

8. Unload p2 from a2.
   Action: unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

Now, p2 is in l1_1. Then use truck t1 to drive to l1_4.

But t1 is in l1_5.

9. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_1.
   Action: drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1

10. Load p2 into t1.
    Action: loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

11. Drive t1 to l1_4.
    Action: drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

12. Unload p2 at l1_4 (goal).
    Action: unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

But during this time, p1's steps need to be handled.

For p1:

We need to have p1 in a2, l2_2, l1_3, and l2_2.

So after step 4 (p2 is in l2_4), let's handle p1.

But wait, step 4 is part of p2's steps, but p1's steps can be interleaved.

For example:

After step 1 (t2 is in l2_5), but before step 2 (loading p2), perhaps do some actions for p1.

But this might complicate the plan.

Alternatively, handle p1's steps while transporting p2.

But this requires careful sequencing.

Let's try integrating p1's steps.

After step 3 (p2 is loaded into t2 and driven to l2_4), let's handle p1.

But p1 is still in l1_1.

Wait, no. Let's go back.

Original initial state: p1 is in l1_1.

So for p1:

Steps:

1. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

2. fly a1 to l2_1.

3. unload p1 at l2_1.

4. load p1 into a2.

5. fly a2 to l2_1? No. To move p1 to l2_2, we need to use truck t2.

But t2 is being used for p2's steps.

So maybe after step 5 of p2's plan (drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2), which is step 5 in p2's plan, t2 is at l2_1. Then, we can use t2 to transport p1.

So after step 5 of p2's plan (t2 is at l2_1), unload p2 from t2 (if it's loaded). Wait, in p2's steps, after step 3 (drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2), p2 is unloaded at l2_4. Then step 5 is driving t2 to l2_1. So t2 is empty at l2_1.

At that point, we can load p1 into t2, but p1 is still in l1_1. So that's not possible unless p1 has been moved.

Alternatively, after p1 is unloaded at l2_1 (step 3 of p1's plan), we can load p1 into t2.

But when is t2 available?

Let's try to merge the steps:

For p2:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2

2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5

3. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2

4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

For p1:

1. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

2. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

3. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

Now, after p1 is unloaded at l2_1 (step 3 of p1's plan), and after p2's step 4 (t2 is in l2_4), we can drive t2 to l2_1 to pick up p1.

But this requires:

5. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2 (part of p2's plan to move to l2_1 for flying)

But in p2's plan, step 5 is drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2, which brings t2 to l2_1. Then, p2 is loaded into a2.

But after that, t2 is at l2_1. So during p2's step 5 (drive to l2_1), t2 arrives there. Then, p1 is at l2_1 (from step 3 of p1's plan). So after p2's step 5:

6. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (assuming p1 is at l2_1)

7. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2

8. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (now p1 is in l2_2, satisfying that constraint)

Then, drive t2 back to l2_1:

9. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2

10. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (if necessary)

Then load p1 into a2:

11. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

12. fly a2 to l1_1.

13. unload p1 from a2 into l1_1.

Then use t1 to move p1 to l1_3 and l1_2.

But this is getting very involved. Let's try to outline the entire plan with interleaved steps.

Combined plan steps:

1. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (p1 in a1)
2. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (a1 at l2_1)
3. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 (p1 at l2_1)
4. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2 (p2's step 1)
5. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 (p2's step 2)
6. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2 (p2's step 3)
7. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (p2's step 4)
8. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2 (p2's step 5)
9. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (p1 into a2)
10. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (a2 at l1_1)
11. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (p1 at l1_1)
12. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1 (move t1 to l1_1)
13. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (p1 in t1)
14. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1 (move to l1_3)
15. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (p1 in l1_3, satisfies constraint)
16. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1 (move to l1_2)
17. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 (goal for p1 achieved)
18. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (but a2 is at l1_1 now. Wait, no. After step 10, a2 is at l1_1. So step 9 loads p1 into a2 at l2_1, then step 10 flies a2 to l1_1. So a2 is now at l1_1. To load p2 into a2, we need to fly a2 back to l2_1. But p2 is in l2_4. Hmm, this is getting tangled.

This approach might not work. Let's rethink.

Alternative plan for p2:

After p2 is unloaded at l2_4 (step 7), we need to drive t2 to l2_1 (step 8). Then, load p2 into a2 (assuming a2 is at l2_1). But a2 is initially at l2_1. So:

8. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
9. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (p2 in a2)
10. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
11. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (p2 in l1_1)
12. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
13. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
14. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
15. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (goal for p2)

But during this time, p1's steps need to be handled.

For p1:

After step 3 (p1 at l2_1), we need to get p1 into a2. So:

4. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (but a2 is at l2_1)
5. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l2_1 (no, need to fly to another airport. Maybe fly to l1_1)
But if we fly a2 to l1_1 with p1, then later fly it back to l2_1 to load p2. This is getting complicated.

Perhaps the correct approach is to use a1 and a2 for different purposes.

Alternatively, use a2 to carry both p1 and p2 at different times.

But let's try to outline the entire plan with all steps:

1. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
2. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
3. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 (p1 at l2_1)
4. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (p1 in a2)
5. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (a2 at l1_1)
6. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (p1 back at l1_1)
7. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1 (move t1 to l1_1)
8. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
9. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
10. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (p1 in l1_3)
11. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1
12. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 (p1 goal achieved)

Now, for p2:

13. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2
14. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
15. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2
16. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
17. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
18. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (but a2 is at l1_1 after step 5. So this is impossible.)

Ah, here's the problem. After step 5, a2 is at l1_1. So we can't load p2 into a2 at l2_1 unless we fly a2 back.

So steps for p2:

17. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1 (after step 5)
18. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
19. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
20. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
21. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 (assuming t1 is at l1_2 after step 11)
22. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
23. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
24. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

But this is adding more steps, and the plan becomes longer.

This is getting too complicated. Let's try to find a more optimal way.

Alternative approach for p1:

Use a1 to carry p1 to l2_1, then use truck t2 to move p1 to l2_2, then back to l2_1, load into a2, fly to l1_1, then drive to l1_3 and l1_2.

For p2: move to l2_4, then use t2 to move to l2_1, load into a2, fly to l1_1, then drive to l1_4.

But we need to sequence these steps so that p1 is in l1_3 before p2 is in l1_4.

Let's outline the plan step by step, ensuring all constraints:

1. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
2. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
3. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 (p1 at l2_1)
4. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2 (move t2 to l2_1)
5. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
6. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
7. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (p1 in l2_2)
8. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 (return t2 to l2_1)
9. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (p1 back at l2_1)
10. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (p1 in a2)
11. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (a2 at l1_1)
12. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (p1 back at l1_1)
13. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1 (move t1 to l1_1)
14. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
15. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
16. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (p1 in l1_3, satisfies constraint)
17. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1
18. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 (p1 goal achieved)

For p2:

19. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2 (step 4 was for p1, but t2 is now at l2_1 after step 8. So need to adjust.)

Wait, after step 8, t2 is at l2_1. To move p2 from l2_5 to l2_4, we need to use t2. But t2 is at l2_1. So:

19. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2 (drive to l2_5)
20. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
21. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2
22. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (now p2 in l2_4)
23. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2 (move to airport)
24. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (but a2 is at l1_1 after step 11)
25. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1 (return a2 to l2_1)
26. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
27. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
28. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
29. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 (t1 is at l1_2 after step 17)
30. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
31. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
32. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (p2 goal achieved)

But this plan is very long and probably not optimal.

But given the constraints, perhaps this is necessary. However, the user demands an optimal (shortest) plan.

Alternative idea: Use a2 to carry both p1 and p2. Let's see.

For p1:

- Load into a1, fly to l2_1, unload.
- Load into a2, fly to l1_1, unload.
- Drive to l1_3, then l1_2.

For p2:

- Use t2 to move to l2_5, load, drive to l2_4, unload.
- Drive t2 to l2_1, load into a2, fly to l1_1, drive to l1_4.

But a2 needs to be used for both p1 and p2.

Steps:

1. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
2. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
3. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 (p1 at l2_1)
4. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (p1 in a2)
5. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (a2 at l1_1 with p1)
6. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (p1 back at l1_1)
7. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1 (move t1)
8. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
9. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
10. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (p1 in l1_3)
11. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1
12. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 (p1 done)

For p2:

13. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2
14. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
15. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2
16. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
17. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
18. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1 (move a2 back to l2_1)
19. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
20. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
21. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
22. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 (t1 is at l1_2)
23. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
24. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
25. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

This plan has 25 steps, which is quite long. Is there a shorter way?

Maybe we can combine steps. For example, after step 5 (a2 at l1_1 with p1), unload p1 (step 6), then immediately load p2 into a2 when it arrives at l1_1. But p2 isn't there yet.

Alternatively, use different airplanes. But there's only a1 and a2. a1 is at l2_1 after step 2.

Wait, after step 2, a1 is at l2_1. Can we use a1 to transport p2?

For example:

For p2:

13. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l2_1 (no, not useful). Or, if a1 is at l2_1, can it fly to l2_1? No. So a1 is stuck there unless used to transport something else.

Alternative idea: Use a1 to transport p2 from l2_1 to l1_1 after a2 has brought p1 back.

But p2 needs to be moved from l2_4 to l2_1 first.

This is getting too time-consuming. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed to draft a plan that meets all the constraints and goals, even if it's lengthy.
