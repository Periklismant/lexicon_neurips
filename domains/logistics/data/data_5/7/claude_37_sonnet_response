Let me first understand and break down this logistics planning problem. 

We have:
- Two cities (c1 and c2)
- Each city has multiple locations including one airport per city (l1_1 is an airport in c1, l2_1 is an airport in c2)
- Two trucks (t1 and t2)
- Two airplanes (a1 and a2)
- Two packages (p1 and p2)

The initial state is:
- Location l1_1 through l1_5 are in city c1
- Location l2_1 through l2_5 are in city c2
- Truck t1 is in location l1_5 (city c1)
- Truck t2 is in location l2_4 (city c2)
- Package p1 is in location l1_1 (airport in city c1)
- Package p2 is in location l2_5 (in city c2)
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (airport in city c1)
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1 (airport in city c2)

The goal is to get:
- Package p1 to location l1_2 (in city c1)
- Package p2 to location l1_4 (in city c1)

The constraints are:
1. p2 must be in l2_5 at some point (it already starts there)
2. If p2 is in l2_5, then it must later be in l2_4
3. p2 must be in l1_4 at some point (part of the goal)
4. If p2 is in l1_4, then p1 must have been in l1_3 earlier
5. p1 must be in l1_3 at some point
6. p1 must be in airplane a2 at some point
7. p1 must be in l2_2 at some point

Wait, let me check something in the initial state. It says "Package t1 is in location l1_5" and "Package t2 is in location l2_4", but t1 and t2 are trucks, not packages. I'll assume these are typos and that the correct initial state is:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_5 (city c1)
- Truck t2 is in location l2_4 (city c2)

Similarly, it says "Package a1 is in location l1_1" and "Package a2 is in location l2_1", but a1 and a2 are airplanes, not packages. I'll assume the correct initial state is:
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (airport in city c1)
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1 (airport in city c2)

Let me now think through the plan:

1. p2 is already at l2_5, so constraint 1 is already satisfied.
2. Constraint 2 requires that if p2 is at l2_5, it must later be at l2_4. So we need to move p2 from l2_5 to l2_4.
3. Eventually, p2 needs to be at l1_4 (as per the goal and constraint 3).
4. Constraint 4 states that if p2 is at l1_4, then p1 must have been at l1_3 earlier. So we need to ensure p1 is at l1_3 before moving p2 to l1_4.
5. Constraint 5 reinforces that p1 must be at l1_3 at some point.
6. Constraint 6 requires p1 to be in airplane a2 at some point.
7. Constraint 7 requires p1 to be at l2_2 at some point.

Let's start planning:

For package p1:
- Start: l1_1
- Needs to be in: l1_3, a2, l2_2, and finally l1_2
- Since p1 needs to be in airplane a2, and a2 is initially at l2_1, p1 needs to be flown from l1_1 to l2_1 using airplane a1, then transferred to a2.
- To satisfy constraint 7, p1 needs to be at l2_2, so after being loaded into a2, it should be flown to l1_1, then be moved by truck to l2_2.
- To satisfy constraint 5, p1 needs to be at l1_3, so after visiting l2_2, it should be taken back to l1_1 by a2, then moved to l1_3 by truck.
- Finally, to achieve the goal, p1 should be moved from l1_3 to l1_2 by truck.

For package p2:
- Start: l2_5
- Needs to be in: l2_4 (as per constraint 2) and finally l1_4 (as per the goal and constraint 3)
- Constraint 4 states that if p2 is at l1_4, then p1 must have been at l1_3 earlier. So we need to ensure p1 is at l1_3 before moving p2 to l1_4.
- p2 should be moved from l2_5 to l2_4 by truck, then to l2_1 by truck, then flown to l1_1, and finally moved to l1_4 by truck.

Let me start by creating a detailed, step-by-step plan.

The available actions are:
- loadtruck
- loadairplane
- unloadtruck
- unloadairplane
- drivetruck
- flyairplane

Let's outline a plan that satisfies all the constraints and reaches the goal:

1. The current state has p1 at l1_1 (airport in city c1) and a1 at l1_1. Let's load p1 into a1.
   ```loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1```

2. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1 (airport in city c2).
   ```flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1```

3. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1.
   ```unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1```

4. Load p1 into a2 at l2_1 (satisfying constraint 6).
   ```loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1```

5. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
   ```flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1```

6. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1.
   ```unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1```

7. We need to move truck t1 from l1_5 to l1_1 to pick up p1.
   ```drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1```

8. Load p1 into t1 at l1_1.
   ```loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1```

9. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_3 (satisfying constraint 5).
   ```drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1```

10. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_3.
    ```unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3```

11. Load p1 back into t1 at l1_3.
    ```loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3```

12. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_2 (part of the goal).
    ```drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1```

13. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_2 (achieving part of the goal).
    ```unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2```

Now, let's handle p2:

14. p2 is already at l2_5. We need to move truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_5 to pick up p2.
    ```drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2```

15. Load p2 into t2 at l2_5.
    ```loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5```

16. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_4 (satisfying constraint 2).
    ```drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2```

17. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_4.
    ```unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4```

18. Load p2 back into t2 at l2_4.
    ```loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4```

19. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1 (airport in city c2).
    ```drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2```

20. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1.
    ```unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1```

21. Load p2 into a1 at l2_1 (a1 is already at l2_1 from step 2).
    ```loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1```

22. Fly a1 from l2_1 to l1_1.
    ```flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1```

23. Unload p2 from a1 at l1_1.
    ```unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1```

24. Move truck t1 from l1_2 to l1_1 to pick up p2.
    ```drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1```

25. Load p2 into t1 at l1_1.
    ```loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1```

26. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_4.
    ```drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1```

27. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_4 (achieving the rest of the goal).
    ```unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4```

Wait, actually I realized that constraint 7 requires that p1 must be at l2_2 at some point. But in my plan, p1 is not routed through l2_2. Let me revise my plan:

For package p1:
- Start: l1_1
- Needs to be in: a2, l2_2, l1_3, and finally l1_2

For package p2:
- Start: l2_5
- Needs to be in: l2_4 and finally l1_4
- Constraint 4 states that if p2 is at l1_4, then p1 must have been at l1_3 earlier.

Let me replan:

1. The current state has p1 at l1_1 (airport in city c1) and a1 at l1_1. Let's load p1 into a1.
   ```loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1```

2. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1 (airport in city c2).
   ```flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1```

3. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1.
   ```unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1```

4. Load p1 into a2 at l2_1 (satisfying constraint 6).
   ```loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1```

5. We need to move truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_1 to pick up p1 after we decide to unload it from a2.
   ```drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2```

6. Unload p1 from a2 at l2_1.
   ```unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1```

7. Load p1 into t2 at l2_1.
   ```loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1```

8. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2 (satisfying constraint 7).
   ```drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2```

9. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_2.
   ```unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2```

10. Load p1 back into t2 at l2_2.
    ```loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2```

11. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1.
    ```drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2```

12. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1.
    ```unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1```

13. Load p1 into a2 at l2_1.
    ```loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1```

14. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
    ```flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1```

15. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1.
    ```unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1```

16. We need to move truck t1 from l1_5 to l1_1 to pick up p1.
    ```drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1```

17. Load p1 into t1 at l1_1.
    ```loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1```

18. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_3 (satisfying constraint 5).
    ```drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1```

19. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_3.
    ```unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3```

20. Load p1 back into t1 at l1_3.
    ```loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3```

21. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_2 (part of the goal).
    ```drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1```

22. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_2 (achieving part of the goal).
    ```unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2```

Now, let's handle p2:

23. p2 is already at l2_5. We need to move truck t2 from l2_1 (where it was left after handling p1) to l2_5 to pick up p2.
    ```drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2```

24. Load p2 into t2 at l2_5.
    ```loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5```

25. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_4 (satisfying constraint 2).
    ```drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2```

26. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_4.
    ```unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4```

27. Load p2 back into t2 at l2_4.
    ```loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4```

28. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
    ```drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2```

29. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1.
    ```unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1```

30. Load p2 into a1 at l2_1 (a1 is already at l2_1 from step 2).
    ```loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1```

31. Fly a1 from l2_1 to l1_1.
    ```flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1```

32. Unload p2 from a1 at l1_1.
    ```unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1```

33. Move truck t1 from l1_2 to l1_1 to pick up p2.
    ```drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1```

34. Load p2 into t1 at l1_1.
    ```loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1```

35. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_4.
    ```drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1```

36. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_4 (achieving the rest of the goal).
    ```unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4```

Now, let's double-check that this plan satisfies all constraints:

1. "p2 must be in l2_5 at some point" - Yes, p2 starts at l2_5.
2. "If p2 is in l2_5, then it must later be in l2_4" - Yes, p2 moves from l2_5 to l2_4 in steps 24-26.
3. "p2 must be in l1_4 at some point" - Yes, p2 ends up at l1_4 in step 36.
4. "If p2 is in l1_4, then p1 must have been in l1_3 earlier" - Yes, p1 is at l1_3 in step 19, which is before p2 is at l1_4 in step 36.
5. "p1 must be in l1_3 at some point" - Yes, p1 is at l1_3 in step 19.
6. "p1 must be in a2 at some point" - Yes, p1 is in a2 in steps 4-6 and 13-15.
7. "p1 must be in l2_2 at some point" - Yes, p1 is at l2_2 in step 9.

The goal is achieved since p1 is at l1_2 in step 22 and p2 is at l1_4 in step 36.

However, I feel like this plan is inefficient. Let's see if we can optimize it a bit.

Let's revisit and make sure we're correctly interpreting the constraints:

1. "p2 must be in l2_5 at some point" - p2 starts at l2_5, so this is already satisfied in the initial state.
2. "If p2 is in l2_5, then it must later be in l2_4" - Since p2 starts at l2_5, it must later visit l2_4.
3. "p2 must be in l1_4 at some point" - This is part of the goal.
4. "If p2 is in l1_4, then there must be an earlier state in which p1 is in l1_3" - Before p2 reaches l1_4, p1 must have visited l1_3.
5. "p1 must be in l1_3 at some point" - This reinforces constraint 4.
6. "p1 must be in a2 at some point" - At some point, p1 must be loaded into airplane a2.
7. "p1 must be in l2_2 at some point" - At some point, p1 must visit location l2_2.

I'll now try to streamline the plan, removing unnecessary steps and making sure all constraints are met.

Let's start with p1's journey:
1. p1 starts at l1_1 (airport in city c1).
2. p1 needs to be loaded onto a2 at some point (constraint 6), and a2 is at l2_1 (airport in city c2).
3. p1 also needs to visit l2_2 in city c2 (constraint 7).
4. p1 must visit l1_3 before p2 reaches l1_4 (constraints 4 and 5).
5. Finally, p1 needs to end up at l1_2 (goal).

And for p2's journey:
1. p2 starts at l2_5 in city c2.
2. p2 must visit l2_4 (constraint 2) since it starts at l2_5.
3. p2 must end up at l1_4 in city c1 (goal and constraint 3), but only after p1 has visited l1_3 (constraint 4).

Let's outline an optimized plan:

1. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1 to retrieve p1 from city c1 to city c2.
   ```flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1```

2. Load p1 into a1 at l1_1.
   ```loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1```

3. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
   ```flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1```

4. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1.
   ```unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1```

5. Load p1 into a2 at l2_1 (satisfying constraint 6).
   ```loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1```

6. Move truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_1 to pick up p1.
   ```drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2```

7. Unload p1 from a2 at l2_1.
   ```unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1```

8. Load p1 into t2 at l2_1.
   ```loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1```

9. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2 (satisfying constraint 7).
   ```drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2```

10. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_2.
    ```unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2```

11. Load p1 back into t2 at l2_2.
    ```loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2```

12. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1.
    ```drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2```

13. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1.
    ```unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1```

14. Load p1 into a2 at l2_1.
    ```loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1```

15. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
    ```flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1```

16. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1.
    ```unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1```

17. Move truck t1 from l1_5 to l1_1 to pick up p1.
    ```drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1```

18. Load p1 into t1 at l1_1.
    ```loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1```

19. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_3 (satisfying constraints 4 and 5).
    ```drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1```

20. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_3.
    ```unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3```

21. Load p1 back into t1 at l1_3.
    ```loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3```

22. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_2 (part of the goal).
    ```drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1```

23. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_2 (achieving part of the goal).
    ```unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2```

Now, for p2:

24. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_5 to pick up p2.
    ```drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2```

25. Load p2 into t2 at l2_5.
    ```loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5```

26. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_4 (satisfying constraint 2).
    ```drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2```

27. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_4.
    ```unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4```

28. Load p2 back into t2 at l2_4.
    ```loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4```

29. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
    ```drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2```

30. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1.
    ```unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1```

31. Load p2 into a1 at l2_1.
    ```loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1```

32. Fly a1 from l2_1 to l1_1.
    ```flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1```

33. Unload p2 from a1 at l1_1.
    ```unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1```

34. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1 to pick up p2.
    ```drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1```

35. Load p2 into t1 at l1_1.
    ```loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1```

36. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_4.
    ```drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1```

37. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_4 (achieving the rest of the goal).
    ```unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4```

Wait, I just realized that there's a mistake in steps 1-3. Let me correct this:

1. Load p1 into a1 at l1_1.
   ```loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1```

2. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
   ```flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1```

3. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1.
   ```unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1```

OK I think the plan is correct now. Let's double-check that this plan satisfies all constraints:

1. "p2 must be in l2_5 at some point" - Yes, p2 starts at l2_5.
2. "If p2 is in l2_5, then it must later be in l2_4" - Yes, p2 moves from l2_5 to l2_4 in steps 25-27.
3. "p2 must be in l1_4 at some point" - Yes, p2 ends up at l1_4 in step 37.
4. "If p2 is in l1_4, then p1 must have been in l1_3 earlier" - Yes, p1 is at l1_3 in step 20, which is before p2 is at l1_4 in step 37.
5. "p1 must be in l1_3 at some point" - Yes, p1 is at l1_3 in step 20.
6. "p1 must be in a2 at some point" - Yes, p1 is in a2 in steps 5-7 and 14-16.
7. "p1 must be in l2_2 at some point" - Yes, p1 is at l2_2 in step 10.

The goal is achieved since p1 is at l1_2 in step 23 and p2 is at l1_4 in step 37.

Wait, I think we can further optimize this plan. Steps 10-14 involve unloading p1, loading it back, driving, unloading, and loading again. We can simplify this.

Also, I unnecessarily duplicated some steps and had a mistake in the earlier part. Let me rewrite the entire plan correctly:

1. Load p1 into a1 at l1_1.
   ```loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1```

2. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
   ```flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1```

3. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1.
   ```unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1```

4. Load p1 into a2 at l2_1 (satisfying constraint 6).
   ```loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1```

5. Move truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_1 to pick up p1 after we decide to unload it from a2.
   ```drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2```

6. Unload p1 from a2 at l2_1.
   ```unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1```

7. Load p1 into t2 at l2_1.
   ```loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1```

8. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2 (satisfying constraint 7).
   ```drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2```

9. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1. (We don't need to unload p1 at l2_2 since constraint 7 only requires p1 to be "in" l2_2, not "at" l2_2).
   ```drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2```

10. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1.
    ```unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1```

11. Load p1 into a2 at l2_1.
    ```loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1```

12. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
    ```flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1```

13. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1.
    ```unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1```

14. Move truck t1 from l1_5 to l1_1 to pick up p1.
    ```drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1```

15. Load p1 into t1 at l1_1.
    ```loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1```

16. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_3 (satisfying constraints 4 and 5).
    ```drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1```

17. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_2 (part of the goal). (Similarly, we don't need to unload p1 at l1_3 since constraint 5 only requires p1 to be "in" l1_3).
    ```drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1```

18. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_2 (achieving part of the goal).
    ```unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2```

Now, for p2:

19. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_5 to pick up p2.
    ```drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2```

20. Load p2 into t2 at l2_5.
    ```loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5```

21. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_4 (satisfying constraint 2).
    ```drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2```

22. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1. (Again, we don't need to unload p2 at l2_4 since constraint 2 only requires p2 to be "in" l2_4).
    ```drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2```

23. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1.
    ```unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1```

24. Load p2 into a1 at l2_1.
    ```loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1```

25. Fly a1 from l2_1 to l1_1.
    ```flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1```

26. Unload p2 from a1 at l1_1.
    ```unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1```

27. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1 to pick up p2.
    ```drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1```

28. Load p2 into t1 at l1_1.
    ```loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1```

29. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_4.
    ```drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1```

30. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_4 (achieving the rest of the goal).
    ```unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4```

Hmm, I'm a bit confused about whether the constraints "p1 must be in l1_3 at some point" and "p1 must be in l2_2 at some point" require p1 to be physically at those locations or if being in a truck at those locations is sufficient. Let's interpret this as requiring p1 to be physically at these locations, not just "in" them via a truck.

In that case, here's a revised plan:

1. Load p1 into a1 at l1_1.
   ```loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1```

2. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
   ```flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1```

3. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1.
   ```unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1```

4. Load p1 into a2 at l2_1 (satisfying constraint 6).
   ```loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1```

5. Move truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_1 to pick up p1 after we decide to unload it from a2.
   ```drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2```

6. Unload p1 from a2 at l2_1.
   ```unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1```

7. Load p1 into t2 at l2_1.
   ```loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1```

8. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2 (satisfying constraint 7).
   ```drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2```

9. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_2.
   ```unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2```

10. Load p1 back into t2 at l2_2.
    ```loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2```

11. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1.
    ```drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2```

12. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1.
    ```unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1```

13. Load p1 into a2 at l2_1.
    ```loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1```

14. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
    ```flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1```

15. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1.
    ```unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1```

16. Move truck t1 from l1_5 to l1_1 to pick up p1.
    ```drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1```

17. Load p1 into t1 at l1_1.
    ```loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1```

18. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_3 (satisfying constraints 4 and 5).
    ```drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1```

19. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_3.
    ```unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3```

20. Load p1 back into t1 at l1_3.
    ```loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3```

21. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_2 (part of the goal).
    ```drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1```

22. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_2 (achieving part of the goal).
    ```unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2```

Now, for p2:

23. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_5 to pick up p2.
    ```drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2```

24. Load p2 into t2 at l2_5.
    ```loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5```

25. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_4 (satisfying constraint 2).
    ```drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2```

26. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_4.
    ```unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4```

27. Load p2 back into t2 at l2_4.
    ```loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4```

28. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
    ```drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2```

29. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1.
    ```unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1```

30. Load p2 into a1 at l2_1.
    ```loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1```

31. Fly a1 from l2_1 to l1_1.
    ```flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1```

32. Unload p2 from a1 at l1_1.
    ```unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1```

33. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1 to pick up p2.
    ```drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1```

34. Load p2 into t1 at l1_1.
    ```loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1```

35. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_4.
    ```drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1```

36. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_4 (achieving the rest of the goal).
    ```unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4```

Let's double-check that this plan satisfies all constraints:

1. "p2 must be in l2_5 at some point" - Yes, p2 starts at l2_5.
2. "If p2 is in l2_5, then it must later be in l2_4" - Yes, p2 moves from l2_5 to l2_4 in steps 24-26.
3. "p2 must be in l1_4 at some point" - Yes, p2 ends up at l1_4 in step 36.
4. "If p2 is in l1_4, then p1 must have been in l1_3 earlier" - Yes, p1 is at l1_3 in steps 18-19, which is before p2 is at l1_4 in step 36.
5. "p1 must be in l1_3 at some point" - Yes, p1 is at l1_3 in steps 18-19.
6. "p1 must be in a2 at some point" - Yes, p1 is in a2 in steps 4-6 and 13-15.
7. "p1 must be in l2_2 at some point" - Yes, p1 is at l2_2 in steps 8-9.

The goal is achieved since p1 is at l1_2 in step 22 and p2 is at l1_4 in step 36.

Let me actually read the constraints one more time:

"The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'Package p2 is in location l2_5'" - So at some point, p2 must be at l2_5. p2 starts at l2_5, so this is satisfied.

"If expression 'Package p2 is in location l2_5' holds in some state s, then expression 'Package p2 is in location l2_4' must hold at s or at some state after s" - So after p2 is at l2_5, it must later be at l2_4. In our plan, p2 is at l2_5 in the initial state and is moved to l2_4 in steps 24-26, so this is satisfied.

"The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'Package p2 is in location l1_4'" - So at some point, p2 must be at l1_4. This is part of the goal, and in our plan, p2 is at l1_4 in step 36, so this is satisfied.

"If expression 'Package p2 is in location l1_4' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'Package p1 is in location l1_3'" - So before p2 is at l1_4, p1 must have been at l1_3. In our plan, p1 is at l1_3 in steps 18-19, and p2 is at l1_4 in step 36, so this is satisfied.

"The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'Package p1 is in location l1_3'" - So at some point, p1 must be at l1_3. In our plan, p1 is at l1_3 in steps 18-19, so this is satisfied.

"The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'Package p1 is in a2'" - So at some point, p1 must be in airplane a2. In our plan, p1 is in a2 in steps 4-6 and 13-15, so this is satisfied.

"The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'Package p1 is in location l2_2'" - So at some point, p1 must be at l2_2. In our plan, p1 is at l2_2 in steps 8-9, so this is satisfied.

OK, the plan satisfies all constraints and achieves the goal. Let me summarize the plan for clarity:

1. Load p1 into a1 at l1_1.
2. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
3. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1.
4. Load p1 into a2 at l2_1.
5. Move truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
6. Unload p1 from a2 at l2_1.
7. Load p1 into t2 at l2_1.
8. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2.
9. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_2.
10. Load p1 into t2 at l2_2.
11. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1.
12. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1.
13. Load p1 into a2 at l2_1.
14. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
15. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1.
16. Move truck t1 from l1_5 to l1_1.
17. Load p1 into t1 at l1_1.
18. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_3.
19. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_3.
20. Load p1 into t1 at l1_3.
21. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_2.
22. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_2.
23. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_5.
24. Load p2 into t2 at l2_5.
25. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_4.
26. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_4.
27. Load p2 into t2 at l2_4.
28. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
29. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1.
30. Load p2 into a1 at l2_1.
31. Fly a1 from l2_1 to l1_1.
32. Unload p2 from a1 at l1_1.
33. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1.
34. Load p2 into t1 at l1_1.
35. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_4.
36. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_4.

This plan brings package p1 to location l1_2 and package p2 to location l1_4, satisfying the goal. It also satisfies all the constraints mentioned.

Ok, on second thought, I think the problem statement might have had a typo. Let me double-check:

It says: "Package t1 is in location l1_5" and "Package t2 is in location l2_4", but t1 and t2 are trucks, not packages. I think the correct initial state might be:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_5 (city c1)
- Truck t2 is in location l2_4 (city c2)

And similarly, it says "Package a1 is in location l1_1" and "Package a2 is in location l2_1", but a1 and a2 are airplanes, not packages. I think the correct initial state is:
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (airport in city c1)
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1 (airport in city c2)

I'll keep interpretting the problem using these assumptions.

Oh wait, I think I also need to clarify one more thing. The problem says:

"If expression 'Package p2 is in location l1_4' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'Package p1 is in location l1_3'"

And I interpreted this as:
"Before p2 is at l1_4, p1 must have been at l1_3."

This is a temporal constraint. It doesn't just require both conditions to be true, but it requires one to be true before the other.

Fortunately, our plan already satisfies this: p1 is at l1_3 in steps 18-19, and p2 is at l1_4 in step 36, so p1 is at l1_3 before p2 is at l1_4.

Let me check if there are any other points where we might optimize:

1. We could try to reduce the steps by removing steps where we unload a package and immediately load it back into the same vehicle. But then the temporal constraints would not be satisfied.

2. We could try a different routing, but given the constraints, I think this is a reasonably efficient plan.

Actually, I just realized that my plan has a major error. The problem says "airplane", not "air_plane," and similarly for "loadairplane", "unloadairplane", and "flyairplane" (no underscore). Let me correct this:

I'll just correct the action names without rewriting the entire plan:
- "loadairplane" (not "load_airplane")
- "unloadairplane" (not "unload_airplane")
- "flyairplane" (not "fly_airplane")

Now the plan should be correct.

Now let me to be sure, let me directly paste the fixed plan:

1. ```loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1```
2. ```flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1```
3. ```unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1```
4. ```loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1```
5. ```drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2```
6. ```unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1```
7. ```loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1```
8. ```drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2```
9. ```unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2```
10. ```loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2```
11. ```drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2```
12. ```unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1```
13. ```loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1```
14. ```flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1```
15. ```unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1```
16. ```drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1```
17. ```loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1```
18. ```drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1```
19. ```unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3```
20. ```loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3```
21. ```drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1```
22. ```unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2```
23. ```drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2```
24. ```loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5```
25. ```drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2```
26. ```unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4```
27. ```loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4```
28. ```drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2```
29. ```unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1```
30. ```loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1```
31. ```flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1```
32. ```unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1```
33. ```drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1```
34. ```loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1```
35. ```drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1```
36. ```unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4```

Let me double check the original problem statement. 

"loadairplane p ap l": Load package p in airplane ap. Both p and ap are in location l.
"loadairplane p ap l": Unload package p from airplane ap in location l.

There's a typo in the problem statement. The second "loadairplane" should be "unloadairplane". I'm going to continue with that understanding.

Now all the action names in the plan match those in the problem statement.

Let me now check if the plan can be optimized further:

1. Steps 9-10 involve unloading p1 from t2 at l2_2 and then loading it back into t2 at l2_2. However, this is necessary to satisfy constraint 7, which requires p1 to be in l2_2 at some point.

2. Steps 19-20 involve unloading p1 from t1 at l1_3 and then loading it back into t1 at l1_3. This is necessary to satisfy constraint 5, which requires p1 to be in l1_3 at some point.

3. Steps 26-27 involve unloading p2 from t2 at l2_4 and then loading it back into t2 at l2_4. This is necessary to satisfy constraint 2, which requires p2 to be in l2_4 at some point.

Given the constraints, I don't see a way to further optimize the plan. The plan satisfies all constraints and achieves the goal while being reasonably efficient.

Here's the final plan:

```loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1```
```flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1```
```unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1```
```loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1```

```drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1```
```unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2```
```drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2```

```drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1```
```unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4```
