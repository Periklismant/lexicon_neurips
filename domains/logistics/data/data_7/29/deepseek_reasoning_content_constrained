Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. Hmm, the goal is to get package p1 to l1_3 and p2 to l1_5. But there are a bunch of constraints we have to satisfy along the way. Let me start by understanding the initial state and the constraints.

First, the initial state:
- p1 is in l2_3 (city c2), p2 is in l1_5 (city c1).
- Trucks t1 is in l1_3 (c1), t2 in l2_3 (c2).
- Airplanes a1 is in l1_1 (c1's airport), a2 in l2_1 (c2's airport).

The goal is p1 in l1_3 and p2 in l1_5. Wait, p2 is already in l1_5, so maybe we just need to move p1? But wait, maybe there's something else. Let me check the problem statement again. Oh, the goal says both p1 in l1_3 and p2 in l1_5. Since p2 is already there, maybe the main task is moving p1 from l2_3 to l1_3. But the constraints complicate things.

Looking at the constraints:

1. At some point, p2 must be in l1_2 or t1.
2. At some point, p1 must be in l2_1.
3. If p1 is in l2_1 (in state s), then either p1 is in l2_5 or p2 is in l1_3 must hold in s or later.
4. Both p2 and p1 must be in a1 at some state.
5. p2 must be in l1_4 at some state.
6. Either p2 is in l1_3 or p1 in l1_4 at some point.
7. Either p2 is in a1 or p1 in l2_5 at some point.
8. p1 must be in a1 at some point.

Wow, that's a lot. Let's break it down step by step.

First, p1 starts in l2_3 (city c2). To get it to l1_3 (city c1), we need to move it between cities. That probably requires using an airplane. So the plan might involve moving p1 from l2_3 to an airport in c2 (like l2_1), load it onto a plane, fly to c1's airport (l1_1), then unload and move via truck to l1_3.

But let's consider the constraints:

- Constraint 2: p1 must be in l2_1. That's the airport in c2. So we need to get p1 there. That's part of the natural path, so maybe that's covered.

- Constraint 3: If p1 is in l2_1, then in that state or later, either p1 is in l2_5 or p2 is in l1_3. Since our goal is to have p1 in l1_3, which is in c1, so p1 can't be in l2_5 (which is in c2). Therefore, after p1 is in l2_1, we must have p2 in l1_3 at some point. But the goal requires p1 in l1_3, which is in c1, so p2 is already in l1_5 (also c1). Wait, p2's final location is l1_5, so how do we get p2 to l1_3? Maybe we have to move p2 to l1_3 temporarily to satisfy this constraint. But the goal requires it to be in l1_5, so we have to move it back. But that complicates the plan. Hmm.

Wait, the goal says p2 must be in l1_5, which is already true in the initial state. Wait, wait, let me check the initial state again. The original state says "Package p2 is in location l1_5". So p2 is already at its goal location. That means the main task is to move p1 from l2_3 to l1_3. But why does the problem exist then? Because there are constraints that require intermediate steps involving p2.

So the problem is mostly about moving p1 to l1_3, but also satisfying the constraints that involve moving p2 around, even though p2 is already where it needs to be. So perhaps the plan involves moving p2 to other locations temporarily to satisfy the constraints, then putting it back.

Let's look at the constraints again:

1. p2 in l1_2 or t1 at some point.
2. p1 in l2_1 at some point.
3. If p1 is in l2_1, then after that, either p1 is in l2_5 (which we can't do because the goal is l1_3) or p2 is in l1_3 (so we need to move p2 to l1_3, which is the goal location for p1, but p2's goal is l1_5. Wait, but the goal requires p2 to stay in l1_5. So if we move p2 to l1_3, then we have to move it back. But how? Because p2 is initially in l1_5. Wait, no, initial state says p2 is in l1_5. So moving it to l1_3 would require taking it from l1_5, which is possible via a truck. But then to get it back to l1_5 again.

Wait, but the goal requires p2 to be in l1_5, which is already true. So maybe the constraints are about intermediate states, and the final state must have p2 in l1_5. So we can move p2 around as long as we put it back.

So for constraint 3, when p1 is in l2_1 (airport of c2), then after that, either p1 goes to l2_5 (which is in c2) but we need p1 to go to c1. So that's not possible. So the other option is p2 must be in l1_3. So after p1 is in l2_1, at some point p2 must be in l1_3. But how? Since p2 is in l1_5 (c1), we can use truck t1 (which is in l1_3) to drive to l1_5, load p2 into t1, drive back to l1_3, unload p2 there. Then later, drive back to l1_5 and unload p2 again to get it back. But that's adding steps. But maybe necessary.

But that's a lot. Let's see.

Constraints:

4. p2 and p1 must both be in a1 at some point. So we need to load both into a1. But a1 starts in l1_1 (c1's airport). So how to get p1 into a1? Since p1 starts in c2, we need to fly it to c1's airport, load into a1, but then we have to unload again. But this would be part of the plan.

Constraint 5: p2 must be in l1_4. So we have to move p2 from l1_5 to l1_4 using a truck. Then maybe move it back.

Constraint 6: either p2 in l1_3 or p1 in l1_4. Since p2 might be in l1_3 (due to constraint 3), that would satisfy this. Or p1 in l1_4. But p1's path is from c2 to c1's airport, then via truck to l1_3. Maybe we can take a detour.

Constraint 7: p2 in a1 or p1 in l2_5. But l2_5 is in c2. Since p1 needs to go to c1, this would require p1 to go to l2_5, which is in c2. But that's conflicting. So probably, we need p2 to be in a1 at some point. Which aligns with constraint 4 and 8 (p1 must be in a1). So maybe both packages are loaded into a1.

Constraint 8: p1 must be in a1 at some point. So that's covered when we load p1 into a1 in l1_1 after flying it there.

Putting this all together:

The plan steps must include:

1. Move p1 from l2_3 (c2) to l2_1 (c2's airport) using truck t2. Because t2 is in l2_3. So drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1, load p1 into t2, then unload at l2_1? Wait, initial positions: t2 is in l2_3. p1 is also in l2_3. So load p1 into t2, then drive t2 to l2_1, unload p1 there. Then load p1 into airplane a2 (which is in l2_1), fly a2 to l1_1 (c1's airport), then unload p1. Then load p1 into truck t1 (but t1 is in l1_3, so need to drive t1 to l1_1? Wait, t1 is in l1_3. So drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1, load p1, then drive back to l1_3 and unload. That would get p1 to its goal.

But along the way, we need to satisfy the constraints. Let's check each step.

But let's outline the possible steps for p1:

- Load p1 into t2 at l2_3.
- Drive t2 to l2_1.
- Unload p1 at l2_1 (satisfies constraint 2).
- Now, constraint 3 says that after p1 is in l2_1, we need either p1 in l2_5 or p2 in l1_3. Since p1 will be moved to c1, we can't have it in l2_5, so we must have p2 in l1_3 at some point after this. So after this step, we need to move p2 to l1_3.

But p2 is in l1_5 (c1). So we can use truck t1 (which is in l1_3) to drive to l1_5, load p2, drive to l1_3, unload. Then later, drive back to l1_5 and unload again. But that's extra steps.

But how to coordinate this with the other constraints.

Also, constraint 4 requires both p1 and p2 to be in a1. So maybe after p1 is in l1_1 (after being flown there), we can load it into a1. Then also load p2 into a1. But p2 is in l1_5. So how to get p2 to l1_1? Use truck t1 to drive from l1_3 to l1_5, load p2, drive to l1_1, unload, then load into a1. Then unload from a1 again, and drive back to l1_5.

But this is getting complicated. Let's try to outline a possible plan.

Possible steps for p1:

1. Load p1 into t2 at l2_3.
2. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1 (c2's airport).
3. Unload p1 at l2_1. Now p1 is in l2_1 (satisfies constraint 2).
   - Now, we need to satisfy constraint 3: after p1 is in l2_1, either p1 in l2_5 or p2 in l1_3. Since we can't have p1 in l2_5, we must have p2 in l1_3 at some point after this. So we need to arrange for that.

4. Load p1 into airplane a2 at l2_1.
5. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1 (c1's airport).
6. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1. Now p1 is in l1_1.
7. Load p1 into a1 (which is in l1_1). This satisfies constraint 8 (p1 in a1). Also, if we load p2 into a1 as well, that satisfies constraint 4 (both in a1).

But how to get p2 into a1. So p2 is in l1_5. Use truck t1:

8. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_5.
9. Load p2 into t1 at l1_5.
10. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_1 (since l1_1 is in c1, can the truck move there? Wait, trucks can only move within their city. c1's locations include l1_1 to l1_5. So yes, t1 can drive to l1_1.

Wait, no: the drivetruck action requires that l_from and l_to are in the same city. So l1_5 and l1_1 are both in c1, so yes.

So steps 8-10 would get p2 to l1_1.

11. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1.
12. Load p2 into a1. Now both p1 and p2 are in a1 (satisfies constraint 4 and 7, since p2 is in a1).

Then, to satisfy constraint 5 (p2 in l1_4), we need to move p2 to l1_4.

But after step 12, p2 is in a1. So we need to unload p2 from a1 somewhere. But a1 is in l1_1. If we unload there, then we can use truck t1 to take p2 to l1_4.

Wait, but a1 is an airplane. To move it to another airport, but maybe we need to fly it somewhere else. But l1_1 is the only airport in c1. So perhaps a1 can't fly to other airports in c1 because they're not airports. So maybe we need to drive p2 from l1_1 to l1_4 via truck.

Wait, after unloading p2 from a1 in l1_1, then load it into t1, drive to l1_4, unload. Then drive back to l1_5 to get p2 back to its original location.

But p2's final location is l1_5, so after moving it to l1_4, we need to move it back.

So steps after 12:

13. Unload p2 from a1 at l1_1.
14. Load p2 into t1 at l1_1.
15. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_4.
16. Unload p2 at l1_4 (satisfies constraint 5).
17. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_5.
18. Unload p2 at l1_5 (since p2's goal is to be here, which it already is, but we moved it to l1_4, so we need to put it back).

But wait, in step 18, we're putting p2 back to l1_5. That's okay.

But during step 16, p2 is in l1_4, satisfying constraint 5.

Now, for constraint 6: either p2 in l1_3 or p1 in l1_4. If p2 is in l1_3, which is required by constraint 3 (since after p1 is in l2_1, we need p2 in l1_3), then we need to arrange that.

But how? Because after moving p2 to l1_3, we need to get it back to l1_5.

Wait, after step 3 (p1 in l2_1), we need p2 to be in l1_3 at some point after. So steps 8-10 are moving p2 to l1_1, but to get to l1_3, perhaps we need to take a detour.

Wait, perhaps after step 10 (t1 arrives at l1_1 with p2), instead of loading into a1 immediately, we drive t1 to l1_3, unload p2 there (satisfying constraint 3), then drive back to l1_1 to load into a1.

But let's see:

Alternate steps after step 3 (p1 in l2_1):

4. Load p1 into a2, fly to l1_1, unload. So steps 4-6 as before.

But to handle constraint 3 (p2 in l1_3 after p1 is in l2_1), let's arrange for p2 to be moved to l1_3.

So:

After step 3 (p1 is in l2_1):

7. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_5 (since t1 is initially in l1_3).
8. Load p2 into t1 at l1_5.
9. Drive t1 back to l1_3.
10. Unload p2 at l1_3. Now p2 is in l1_3, satisfying constraint 3 and constraint 6 (since either p2 in l1_3 or p1 in l1_4; here, p2 in l1_3).

Then, after that, we need to move p2 back to l1_5. But wait, the goal requires p2 to be in l1_5, which it already is. But if we moved it to l1_3, then we need to move it back. So steps:

11. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_5.
12. Unload p2 at l1_5.

But this would undo the movement, but the constraint only requires that at some state p2 is in l1_3, which step 10 accomplishes. Then p2 is back in l1_5 at step 12, which is its goal.

Now, proceeding with moving p1:

After step 6 (p1 is in l1_1), then:

13. Load p1 into a1 (satisfies constraint 8).
14. Load p2 into a1 as well. But p2 is in l1_5 at this point. Wait, no. After step 12, p2 is back in l1_5. So how to get p2 into a1?

This complicates things. Because if we need to have both p1 and p2 in a1 (constraint 4), but after moving p2 to l1_3 and back, we need to get p2 to l1_1 again to load into a1.

Alternatively, maybe after moving p2 to l1_3 (step 10), before moving it back, we take it to l1_1 and load into a1.

Wait, let's adjust:

After step 10 (p2 in l1_3):

11. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1 (with p2? No, p2 is in l1_3. Wait, t1 is in l1_3 after unloading p2 there. So to move p2 to l1_1, we need to load it into t1 again.

Wait, after step 10: p2 is in l1_3, t1 is in l1_3.

So:

11. Load p2 into t1 at l1_3.
12. Drive t1 to l1_1.
13. Unload p2 at l1_1.
14. Load p2 into a1 (along with p1, which is in l1_1).

This would satisfy constraint 4.

Then, after that, we can fly a1 to some location? Wait, no, a1 is already in l1_1. If we need to unload p2 somewhere else, like l1_4 to satisfy constraint 5.

So after loading both into a1:

15. Unload p2 from a1 into l1_1.
16. Load p2 into t1, drive to l1_4, unload (satisfies constraint 5), then drive back to l1_5.

This is getting really long. But let's try to outline a possible plan.

But we need to make sure all constraints are met. Let's list the constraints again and check which steps cover them:

1. p2 in l1_2 or t1. Hmm, in the steps above, when is p2 in t1? When we load p2 into t1 at l1_5 (step 8), then drive to l1_3 (step 9), unload (step 10). So during steps 8-10, p2 is in t1. So that would satisfy constraint 1 (since p2 is in t1 at that time).

Alternatively, if we drive t1 to l1_2, but that's not necessary. Since constraint 1 requires at least one of the two, and p2 being in t1 satisfies it.

2. p1 in l2_1. Achieved when p1 is unloaded there in step 3.

3. After p1 is in l2_1, p2 in l1_3. Achieved in step 10.

4. Both in a1. Achieved when both are loaded into a1 in steps 13 and 14.

5. p2 in l1_4. Achieved when we drive t1 to l1_4 and unload.

6. Either p2 in l1_3 (step 10) or p1 in l1_4. So step 10 covers this.

7. Either p2 in a1 (step 14) or p1 in l2_5. Since p2 is in a1, this is satisfied.

8. p1 in a1. Achieved in step 13.

So the plan must include all these steps.

Putting it all together:

Steps for p1:

1. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (since p1 and t2 are both in l2_3)
2. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
3. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (now p1 is in l2_1, satisfying constraint 2)
4. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (a2 is in l2_1)
5. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
6. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (p1 now in l1_1)
7. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (p1 into a1, satisfying constraint 8)

Steps for p2:

8. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_5 c1 (t1 is initially in l1_3)
9. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 (p2 is there)
10. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1
11. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (now p2 is in l1_3, satisfying constraint 3 and 6)
12. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (to move it to l1_1)
13. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
14. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
15. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (now both p1 and p2 are in a1, satisfying constraints 4 and 7)
16. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (to move p2 to l1_4)
17. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
18. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
19. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (satisfies constraint 5)
20. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1
21. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 (back to original location)

Finally, move p1 from a1 to l1_3:

22. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (assuming p1 is still in a1)
23. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (t1 is in l1_5 after step 21? Wait, no. After step 21, t1 is in l1_5. So maybe we need to adjust.

Wait, after step 21, t1 is in l1_5. To move p1 from l1_1 to l1_3, we need a truck. But t1 is in l1_5. So maybe use another truck? Wait, there's t1 and t2. t1 is in c1, t2 is in c2. So t1 is the only truck in c1.

So after step 21, t1 is in l1_5. So to get p1 from l1_1 to l1_3:

22. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1 (drive to l1_1)
23. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
24. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
25. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (goal achieved)

But wait, after step 6, p1 is in l1_1. Then in step 7, it's loaded into a1. Then in step 15, p2 is loaded into a1. Then in step 16, p2 is unloaded. Then in step 22, we unload p1 from a1? Or is p1 still in a1?

Wait, after step 7, p1 is in a1 (loaded). Then steps 8-21 handle moving p2. Then step 22 would need to unload p1 from a1 to l1_1, then load into t1, drive to l1_3.

So:

After step 7: p1 is in a1 at l1_1.

Steps for p2 continue until step 21, where p2 is back in l1_5.

Then steps for p1:

22. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
23. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (t1 is in l1_5 at step 21, so we need to drive t1 back to l1_1)

Wait, after step 21, t1 is in l1_5. So:

22. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
23. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
24. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
25. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (goal achieved)

But p1 is in a1 until step 22. So step 22 is unload p1 from a1:

Wait, no. Steps:

After step 7: p1 is in a1.

In step 15: p2 is loaded into a1 (so both are in a1).

Then step 16: unload p2 from a1 into l1_1.

But p1 is still in a1. So after step 16, p1 is still in a1.

So after step 16, we need to unload p1 from a1:

17. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (but this is after step 16?)

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

After step 15 (both p1 and p2 loaded into a1):

16. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (to move p2)
17. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (now p1 is back in l1_1)

Then:

18. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (but t1 is in l1_3 after step 13? Wait, no. Let's track truck movements.

This is getting very complicated. Maybe I need to outline the entire plan step by step, making sure all preconditions are met and constraints are satisfied.

Let me try to draft the plan:

1. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
2. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
3. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (p1 in l2_1, constraint 2 met)
4. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
5. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
6. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (p1 in l1_1)
7. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (p1 in a1, constraint 8 met)
   
Now handle p2:

8. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_5 c1 (t1 moves to p2's location)
9. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 (p2 in t1, constraint 1 met)
10. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1 (back to l1_3)
11. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (p2 in l1_3, constraint 3 and 6 met)
12. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (to move to l1_1)
13. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
14. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (p2 in l1_1)
15. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (p2 in a1, with p1 already there, constraints 4 and 7 met)
   
Now to move p2 to l1_4:

16. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
17. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
18. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
19. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (constraint 5 met)
20. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1
21. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 (p2 back to goal)

Now move p1 from a1 to l1_3:

22. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (p1 back to l1_1)
23. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (t1 is in l1_5 after step 21, need to drive back?)

Wait, after step 21, t1 is in l1_5. So to load p1 into t1, we need t1 to be in l1_1.

22. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
23. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
24. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
25. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (goal achieved)

This plan has 25 steps, but I need to check if all preconditions are met and constraints are satisfied.

Let's verify each action's preconditions:

1. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3: p1 and t2 are in l2_3 initially. Correct.
2. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2: t2 is in l2_3, and l2_3 and l2_1 are in c2. Correct.
3. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1: t2 is in l2_1, p1 is in t2. Correct after step 1 and 2.
4. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1: p1 and a2 are in l2_1. a2 starts in l2_1? Wait, initial state says "Package a2 is in location l2_1". Wait, wait, the original state says "Package a1 is in location l1_1" and "Package a2 is in location l2_1". So airplanes a1 and a2 are initially at their respective airports. So yes, step 4 is valid.
5. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1: a2 is in l2_1. Correct.
6. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1: a2 is in l1_1 after flying. Correct.
7. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1: p1 and a1 are in l1_1. Correct.
8. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_5 c1: t1 starts in l1_3. Correct.
9. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5: p2 and t1 are in l1_5. Correct after step 8.
10. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1: locations in c1. Correct.
11. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3: t1 is in l1_3, p2 in t1. Correct.
12. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3: p2 and t1 in l1_3. Correct.
13. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1: valid.
14. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1: correct.
15. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1: p2 and a1 in l1_1. Correct.
16. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1: a1 in l1_1, p2 in a1. Correct.
17. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1: p2 and t1 in l1_1. Correct.
18. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1: valid.
19. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4: correct.
20. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1: valid.
21. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5: correct.
22. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1: valid.
23. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1: p1 is in l1_1 (unloaded from a1 in step 22?), t1 in l1_1. Wait, after step 21, t1 is in l1_5. Step 22 drives it to l1_1. Then in step 23, load p1 into t1. But after step 7, p1 is in a1. When does p1 get unloaded from a1?

Ah, here's a mistake. After step 7, p1 is in a1. To unload it, we need an unloadairplane action. So after step 15 (loading p2 into a1), we need to unload both p1 and p2.

But in the current plan, after step 15, p1 is in a1. Steps 16-21 handle p2, but p1 remains in a1. So after step 21, p1 is still in a1. So before step 22, we need to unload p1 from a1.

So modifying the plan:

After step 15 (loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1):

16. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (now p1 is in l1_1)
17. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (p2 in l1_1)
18. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (t1 is in l1_1 after step 13? Wait, step 13: drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1 (step 13), then step 14 unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1. So after step 14, t1 is in l1_1. Then step 15 loads p2 into a1. Then step 17 unloads p2 from a1 into l1_1. Then step 18 loads p2 into t1 (which is in l1_1). Then step 19 drivetruck t1 to l1_4.

But this is getting too tangled. Let me reorganize the steps correctly.

Correct sequence for p2 after step 7:

8. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_5 c1
9. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
10. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1
11. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (p2 in l1_3)
12. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (now p2 in t1)
13. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
14. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (p2 in l1_1)
15. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (now both p1 and p2 in a1)
16. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (p1 back to l1_1)
17. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (p2 back to l1_1)
18. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
19. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
20. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (constraint 5)
21. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1
22. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 (p2 back to goal)

Now, moving p1:

23. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (t1 is in l1_5 after step 22. So need to drive t1 back to l1_1)

23. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
24. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
25. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
26. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (goal)

But this makes the plan longer. Also, we need to check if all constraints are met.

But the main issue is ensuring that the constraints are satisfied in the plan. Let's check each:

1. p2 in t1: step 9-10: p2 is in t1 during steps 9-10 (loaded in 9, driven, unloaded in 11). So during step 9-10, p2 is in t1. So constraint 1 is met.

2. p1 in l2_1: step 3.

3. After step 3 (p1 in l2_1), in steps 11, p2 is in l1_3. So constraint 3 is met.

4. Both in a1: step 15, p2 is loaded into a1, which already has p1 (step 7). But wait, step 7 loads p1 into a1. Then step 15 loads p2 into a1. So yes, both are in a1 at step 15. So constraint 4 met.

5. p2 in l1_4: step 20.

6. p2 in l1_3 (step 11) → constraint 6 met.

7. p2 in a1 (step 15) → constraint 7 met.

8. p1 in a1 (step 7) → constraint 8 met.

So all constraints are satisfied.

But the plan is quite long. Is there a way to optimize?

For example, after moving p1 to a1 (step 7), instead of moving p2 to l1_3 via steps 8-11, maybe we can find a shorter path. But the constraints require p2 to be in l1_3 after p1 is in l2_1. So steps 8-11 are necessary.

Another optimization: when moving p2 to l1_1, can we combine steps? Maybe not. 

Alternatively, after loading both into a1 (step 15), can we fly a1 to another location? But the only airports are l1_1 and l2_1. Since we need p1 in l1_3 (c1), which isn't an airport, we have to use a truck. So flying doesn't help here.

Hmm. The plan seems to be necessary as drafted. But maybe there's a shorter way.

Wait, what if after step 11 (p2 in l1_3), we unload p2 into l1_3, then immediately load it back into t1, drive to l1_1, load into a1 with p1. Then proceed to move p2 to l1_4. 

Yes, that's what the current plan does.

Alternatively, after step 11, could we drive t1 to l1_4 and unload p2 there? But that would require moving p2 to l1_4 earlier, but step 11 is in l1_3. So:

After step 11 (p2 in l1_3):

12. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
13. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1
14. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (satisfies constraint 5)
15. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1
16. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 (back to goal)

But then we still need to get p2 into a1 with p1. So after step 11, p2 is in l1_3. To get both into a1, we need to move p2 to l1_1. So steps:

17. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
18. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
19. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
20. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (with p1 already there)
21. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (to move to l1_4)

But this complicates the plan further. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to have p2 in l1_3 and then move it to l1_1 via truck, then into a1. But this seems necessary to satisfy constraint 4.

Overall, the initial plan I drafted seems to cover all constraints. But it's quite long. However, since the problem requires an optimal plan (shortest possible), I need to check if there's a way to reduce steps.

Wait, perhaps after step 11 (p2 in l1_3), we can drive t1 to l1_1, load p2 into a1, then unload p2 into l1_4 directly via airplane. But airplanes can only fly between airports. So a1 is in l1_1. To get p2 to l1_4, we need a truck.

Alternatively, after loading p2 into a1 (step 15), we can fly a1 to another airport, but there's no other airport in c1. So the only option is to drive.

Hmm. So the plan as drafted may be the shortest possible, given all the constraints.

Therefore, the final plan would be:

```
```
1. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
2. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
3. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
4. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
5. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
6. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
7. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
8. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_5 c1
9. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
10. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1
11. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
12. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
13. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
14. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
15. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
16. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
17. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
18. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
19. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
20. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
21. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1
22. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
23. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
24. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
25. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
26. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
```
```

But this has 26 steps. However, perhaps some steps can be merged or reordered.

Wait, after step 7, p1 is in a1. Then step 15 loads p2 into a1. Then steps 16 and 17 unload both. But maybe we can unload p1 earlier.

Alternatively, after step 7, unload p1 from a1, then load both into a1 later. But that might not help.

Alternatively, can we fly a1 somewhere else? No, since a1 is already in l1_1, and other locations are not airports.

Another optimization: After step 13, t1 is in l1_1. So after step 14, p2 is unloaded in l1_1. Then step 15 loads p2 into a1 (which is in l1_1). Then step 16 unloads p1 from a1. But p1 is needed in l1_3. So step 24 loads p1 into t1. But t1 is in l1_1 after step 13.

Wait, after step 13, t1 is in l1_1. After step 14, t1 is still in l1_1. Then step 18 loads p2 into t1 (but t1 is in l1_1). Then steps 19-22 move p2 to l1_5. Then step 23 drives t1 back to l1_1. Then step 24 loads p1 into t1 and drives to l1_3.

But perhaps we can load p1 into t1 earlier. For example, after step 16 (p1 unloaded from a1 into l1_1), then load p1 into t1 (which is in l1_1 at that time). Then drive to l1_3.

So modifying steps:

After step 15 (load p2 into a1):

16. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (p1 in l1_1)
17. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (t1 is in l1_1 after step 13)
18. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
19. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (goal achieved)
Then proceed with p2 steps:

20. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (p2 in l1_1)
21. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (t1 is in l1_3 now. No, after step 18, t1 is in l1_3. So need to drive t1 back to l1_1 to load p2. This complicates again.)

Alternatively, after step 19, p1 is in l1_3. Then handle p2:

20. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
21. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (but t1 is in l1_3)
22. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
23. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
24. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
25. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
26. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1
27. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

This increases steps again. So the initial approach seems unavoidable.

Another angle: Since p2 is already at its goal, maybe some steps can be omitted. But the constraints require moving it around, so no.

Perhaps the optimal plan is 26 steps as above. But I'm not sure if there's a shorter way. Maybe I'm missing something.

Alternative approach: Use airplane a1 to carry both packages and move them in fewer steps. For example:

1. Move p1 to l2_1 via truck t2.
2. Fly p1 to l1_1 via a2.
3. Load p1 into a1.
4. Move p2 to l1_1 via truck t1.
5. Load p2 into a1.
6. Fly a1 to another airport (but no other airports exist), so can't. So unload p2 in l1_1, then move to l1_4 via truck.
7. Unload p2 in l1_4, then move back.

This still requires many steps.

Another idea: Since constraint 5 requires p2 in l1_4, maybe during the process of moving p2 to l1_3 (for constraint 3), we can pass through l1_4. For example:

After loading p2 into t1 in l1_5 (step 9), drive t1 to l1_4 (step 10), then to l1_3 (step 11). This way, p2 is in l1_4 during the drive. But to unload, we need to stop at l1_4.

But this would require:

9. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
10. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1
11. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (satisfies constraint 5)
12. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1
13. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (satisfies constraint 3)

This reduces steps. Let's see:

Steps for p2:

8. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_5 c1
9. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
10. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1
11. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (constraint 5)
12. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
13. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1
14. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (constraint 3 and 6)
15. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
16. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
17. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
18. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (with p1 in a1)
19. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (to move back)
20. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
21. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

This reduces some steps. Now, the steps for p2 are 8-21, but fewer actions.

This way, step 11 handles constraint 5 (p2 in l1_4), and step 14 handles constraint 3 and 6.

Then steps for p1 remain as before.

Let's integrate this:

Overall plan:

1. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
2. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
3. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (constraint 2)
4. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
5. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
6. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
7. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (constraint 8)
   
For p2:

8. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_5 c1
9. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 (constraint 1)
10. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1
11. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (constraint 5)
12. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
13. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1
14. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (constraint 3 and 6)
15. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
16. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
17. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
18. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (constraint 4 and 7)
19. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
20. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
21. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
22. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 (p2 back to goal)
   
For p1:

23. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (t1 is in l1_5 after step 22, so need to drive back)
24. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
25. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
26. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
27. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (goal achieved)

But this still has 27 steps. But perhaps there's a better way.

Wait, after step 22, t1 is in l1_5. To move p1, which is in l1_1 (unloaded from a1 in step 19), we need to get t1 back to l1_1.

23. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
24. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
25. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
26. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3

So steps 23-26 for p1.

Total steps: 26.

But maybe after step 19, p1 is in l1_1. Instead of steps 23-26, can we use another truck? But only t1 is in c1. So no. Must use t1.

This seems to be the most optimized plan, given the constraints. Therefore, the final answer would be this 26-step plan. But I need to check if all constraints are met.

Constraint 7: Either p2 in a1 or p1 in l2_5. Since p2 is in a1 (step 18), this is satisfied.

All other constraints are checked as before.

Thus, the optimal plan is as follows.
