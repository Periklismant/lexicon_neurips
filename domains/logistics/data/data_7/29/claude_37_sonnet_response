Let me carefully analyze this planning problem.

First, let's understand what we have:
- Cities, locations, airports, trucks, airplanes, and packages
- Available actions: loadtruck, loadairplane, unloadtruck, unloadairplane, drivetruck, flyairplane
- The world objects: 10 locations (including 2 airports), 2 cities, 2 packages, 2 trucks, 2 airplanes
- Initial state and goal state

There seems to be an error in the initial state. It says "Package t1 is in location l1_3", "Package t2 is in location l2_3", etc., but t1 and t2 are trucks, not packages. a1 and a2 are airplanes, not packages. Let me correct these and restate the initial state:

Initial state:
- "Location l1_1 is in city c1" (l1_1 is an airport in city c1)
- "Location l1_2 is in city c1"
- "Location l1_3 is in city c1"
- "Location l1_4 is in city c1"
- "Location l1_5 is in city c1"
- "Location l2_1 is in city c2" (l2_1 is an airport in city c2)
- "Location l2_2 is in city c2"
- "Location l2_3 is in city c2"
- "Location l2_4 is in city c2"
- "Location l2_5 is in city c2"
- "Truck t1 is in location l1_3"
- "Truck t2 is in location l2_3"
- "Package p1 is in location l2_3"
- "Package p2 is in location l1_5"
- "Airplane a1 is in location l1_1"
- "Airplane a2 is in location l2_1"

Goal state:
- "Package p1 is in location l1_3"
- "Package p2 is in location l1_5"

In the initial state, p1 is in l2_3 (city c2) and needs to get to l1_3 (city c1), and p2 is already in l1_5 (city c1).

Now, let's understand the constraints:

1. At some point, p2 must be in l1_2 or in t1.
2. At some point, p1 must be in l2_1 (airport in city c2).
3. If p1 is in l2_1, then at that state or later, either p1 must be in l2_5 or p2 must be in l1_3.
4. At some point, both p2 and p1 must be in airplane a1.
5. At some point, p2 must be in l1_4.
6. At some point, either p2 must be in l1_3 or p1 must be in l1_4.
7. At some point, either p2 must be in a1 or p1 must be in l2_5.
8. At some point, p1 must be in a1.

Let's start planning:

First, let's think about p1. It's in l2_3 (city c2) and needs to get to l1_3 (city c1). This will require a trip via truck to the airport in c2 (l2_1), then via airplane to the airport in c1 (l1_1), and finally via truck to l1_3. 

For p2, it starts in l1_5 (city c1) and already has the goal location l1_5. But there are several constraints involving p2, so it will need to move around and then return to l1_5.

Let's sketch a high-level plan:

1. Move p1 from l2_3 to l2_1 using truck t2. This satisfies constraint 2 (p1 in l2_1).
2. While p1 is in l2_1, we need to ensure constraint 3. At that point or later, p1 should be in l2_5 or p2 should be in l1_3. If p1 doesn't visit l2_5, we'll need to move p2 to l1_3.
3. Move p1 from l2_1 to l1_1 using airplane a1. This satisfies constraint 8 (p1 in a1).
4. Move p2 to a1 (at l1_1). This, combined with step 3, satisfies constraint 4 (both p1 and p2 in a1).
5. Move p2 to l1_3 and then to l1_4. This satisfies constraint 5 (p2 in l1_4) and potentially constraint 6 (p2 in l1_3).
6. Move p2 to l1_2 and then back to l1_5. This satisfies constraint 1 (p2 in l1_2).
7. Move p1 from l1_1 to l1_3. This completes the goal for p1.

This is a sketchy plan. Let's refine it further:

First, we need to handle constraint 7 (either p2 in a1 or p1 in l2_5). Since we're planning to put both p1 and p2 in a1, that should take care of it.

For constraint 3, we need to think about the timing. The constraint says that if p1 is in l2_1, then at that point or later, p1 should be in l2_5 or p2 should be in l1_3. Since p1 will be in l2_1 at some point (on its way from l2_3 to l1_1), we need to ensure one of those two conditions is met.

For constraint 6, either p2 must be in l1_3 or p1 must be in l1_4. We're planning to move p2 to l1_3, so that covers it.

Now, let's detail the plan more explicitly:

1. Move truck t2 from l2_3 to l2_1 (drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2)
2. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_3 before moving (loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3)
3. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1 (unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1) - This satisfies constraint 2
4. To satisfy constraint 3, we need either p1 in l2_5 or p2 in l1_3 after p1 is in l2_1. Let's choose to move p2 to l1_3 later, as it seems more efficient.
5. Load p1 onto a1 at l2_1 (loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1) - This satisfies constraint 8
6. Fly a1 from l2_1 to l1_1 (flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1)
7. Move truck t1 from l1_3 to l1_5 (drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_5 c1)
8. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_5 (loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5)
9. Move t1 from l1_5 to l1_1 (drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1)
10. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1 (unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1)
11. Load p2 onto a1 at l1_1 (loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1) - This, combined with p1 already in a1, satisfies constraint 4
12. Unload p2 from a1 at l1_1 (unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1)
13. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_1 (loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1)
14. Move t1 from l1_1 to l1_3 (drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1)
15. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_3 (unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3) - This, combined with p1 in l2_1 earlier, satisfies constraint 3 and part of constraint 6
16. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_3 (loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3)
17. Move t1 from l1_3 to l1_4 (drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1)
18. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_4 (unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4) - This satisfies constraint 5
19. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_4 (loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4)
20. Move t1 from l1_4 to l1_2 (drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1)
21. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_2 (unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2) - This satisfies constraint 1
22. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_2 (loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2)
23. Move t1 from l1_2 to l1_5 (drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_5 c1)
24. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_5 (unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5) - This completes the goal for p2
25. Unload p1 from a1 at l1_1 (unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1)
26. Move t1 from l1_5 to l1_1 (drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1)
27. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_1 (loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1)
28. Move t1 from l1_1 to l1_3 (drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1)
29. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_3 (unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3) - This completes the goal for p1

Wait, there's a problem with this plan. I realized p1 needs to be loaded onto truck t2 before the truck can move from l2_3 to l2_1. Let me revise the steps. Also, airplane a1 is in l1_1, not l2_1, so p1 can't be loaded directly onto a1 at l2_1. Let me adjust the plan:

Revised plan:
1. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_3 (loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3)
2. Move truck t2 from l2_3 to l2_1 (drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2)
3. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1 (unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1) - This satisfies constraint 2
4. To satisfy constraint 3, we need either p1 in l2_5 or p2 in l1_3 after p1 is in l2_1.

Actually, I need to think about the most efficient way to move p1 from city c2 to city c1. We have two airplanes: a1 at l1_1 and a2 at l2_1. It seems more efficient to use a2 which is already at l2_1 (where p1 will be). Let's revise the plan:

1. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_3 (loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3)
2. Move truck t2 from l2_3 to l2_1 (drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2)
3. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1 (unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1) - This satisfies constraint 2, but now we need to address constraint 3.

For constraint 3, we need either p1 in l2_5 or p2 in l1_3 after p1 is in l2_1. Let's go with p1 in l2_5 as it's more direct from where p1 currently is:

4. Move truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_5 (drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2)
5. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_5 (loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5)
6. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_5 (unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5) - This satisfies part of constraint 3 and part of constraint 7

Now, we need to get p1 to l1_3 (the goal). Let's use a2 to fly from l2_1 to l1_1:

7. Move truck t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2)
8. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_5 (loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5)
9. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1 (unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1)
10. Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1 (loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1)
11. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1 (flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1)
12. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1 (unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1)

Wait, constraints 4 and 8 require p1 to be in a1 at some point, and constraint 4 requires both p1 and p2 to be in a1. So, we should use a1 for p1:

10. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1 (flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1)
11. Load p1 onto a1 at l2_1 (loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1) - This satisfies constraint 8
12. Fly a1 from l2_1 to l1_1 (flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1)

Now, we need to handle p2. It needs to be in a1 with p1 (constraint 4), visit l1_4 (constraint 5), and end up in l1_5 (the goal).

13. Move truck t1 from l1_3 to l1_5 (drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_5 c1)
14. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_5 (loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5)
15. Move t1 from l1_5 to l1_1 (drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1)
16. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1 (unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1)
17. Load p2 onto a1 at l1_1 (loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1) - This, combined with p1 already in a1, satisfies constraint 4
18. Unload p2 from a1 at l1_1 (unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1)
19. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_1 (loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1)

Now, to handle constraints 1, 5, and 6:

20. Move t1 from l1_1 to l1_3 (drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1)
21. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_3 (unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3) - This satisfies constraint 6 (p2 in l1_3)
22. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_3 (loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3)
23. Move t1 from l1_3 to l1_4 (drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1)
24. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_4 (unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4) - This satisfies constraint 5
25. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_4 (loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4)
26. Move t1 from l1_4 to l1_2 (drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1)
27. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_2 (unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2) - This satisfies constraint 1
28. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_2 (loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2)
29. Move t1 from l1_2 to l1_5 (drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_5 c1)
30. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_5 (unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5) - This completes the goal for p2

Finally, we need to get p1 from l1_1 to l1_3 (the goal):

31. Unload p1 from a1 at l1_1 (unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1)
32. Move t1 from l1_5 to l1_1 (drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1)
33. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_1 (loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1)
34. Move t1 from l1_1 to l1_3 (drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1)
35. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_3 (unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3) - This completes the goal for p1

Wait, I realized there are some redundancies and errors in this plan. Let me revise it one more time, focusing on making the plan as efficient as possible.

Here's my attempt at a more efficient plan:

1. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_3 (loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3)
2. Move truck t2 from l2_3 to l2_1 (drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2)
3. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1 (unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1) - This satisfies constraint 2

Now, for constraint 3, we need either p1 in l2_5 or p2 in l1_3 after p1 is in l2_1. Let's go with p1 in l2_5:

4. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_1 (loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1)
5. Move truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_5 (drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2)
6. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_5 (unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5) - This satisfies part of constraint 3 and part of constraint 7
7. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_5 (loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5)
8. Move truck t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2)
9. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1 (unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1)
10. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1 (flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1)
11. Load p1 onto a1 at l2_1 (loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1) - This satisfies constraint 8
12. Fly a1 from l2_1 to l1_1 (flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1)

Now for p2:

13. Move truck t1 from l1_3 to l1_5 (drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_5 c1)
14. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_5 (loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5)
15. Move t1 from l1_5 to l1_1 (drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1)
16. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1 (unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1)
17. Load p2 onto a1 at l1_1 (loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1) - This, combined with p1 already in a1, satisfies constraint 4 and part of constraint 7
18. Unload p2 from a1 at l1_1 (unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1)
19. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_1 (loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1)
20. Move t1 from l1_1 to l1_3 (drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1)
21. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_3 (unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3) - This satisfies constraint 6
22. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_3 (loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3)
23. Move t1 from l1_3 to l1_4 (drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1)
24. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_4 (unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4) - This satisfies constraint 5
25. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_4 (loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4)
26. Move t1 from l1_4 to l1_2 (drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1)
27. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_2 (unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2) - This satisfies constraint 1
28. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_2 (loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2)
29. Move t1 from l1_2 to l1_5 (drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_5 c1)
30. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_5 (unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5) - This achieves the goal for p2

Finally, for p1:

31. Unload p1 from a1 at l1_1 (unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1)
32. Move t1 from l1_5 to l1_1 (drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1)
33. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_1 (loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1)
34. Move t1 from l1_1 to l1_3 (drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1)
35. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_3 (unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3) - This achieves the goal for p1

The above plan is fairly efficient but there's a problem - I've specified a few steps where we load and unload the same object at the same location immediately. That's not necessary. Let me fix this:

1. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_3 (loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3)
2. Move truck t2 from l2_3 to l2_1 (drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2)
3. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1 (unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1) - This satisfies constraint 2
4. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_1 (loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1)
5. Move truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_5 (drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2)
6. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_5 (unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5) - This satisfies part of constraint 3 and part of constraint 7
7. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_5 (loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5)
8. Move truck t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2)
9. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1 (unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1)
10. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1 (flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1)
11. Load p1 onto a1 at l2_1 (loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1) - This satisfies constraint 8
12. Fly a1 from l2_1 to l1_1 (flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1)
13. Move truck t1 from l1_3 to l1_5 (drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_5 c1)
14. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_5 (loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5)
15. Move t1 from l1_5 to l1_1 (drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1)
16. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1 (unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1)
17. Load p2 onto a1 at l1_1 (loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1) - This, combined with p1 already in a1, satisfies constraint 4 and part of constraint 7
18. Unload p2 from a1 at l1_1 (unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1)
19. Unload p1 from a1 at l1_1 (unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1)
20. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_1 (loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1)
21. Move t1 from l1_1 to l1_3 (drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1)
22. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_3 (unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3) - This satisfies constraint 6
23. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_3 (loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3)
24. Move t1 from l1_3 to l1_4 (drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1)
25. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_4 (unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4) - This satisfies constraint 5
26. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_4 (loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4)
27. Move t1 from l1_4 to l1_2 (drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1)
28. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_2 (unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2) - This satisfies constraint 1
29. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_2 (loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2)
30. Move t1 from l1_2 to l1_5 (drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_5 c1)
31. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_5 (unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5) - This achieves the goal for p2
32. Move t1 from l1_5 to l1_1 (drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1)
33. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_1 (loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1)
34. Move t1 from l1_1 to l1_3 (drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1)
35. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_3 (unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3) - This achieves the goal for p1

Wait, I've now realized there's also a problem with the loadairplane and unloadairplane actions. In the action descriptions, the loadairplane action was described twice, and the second time it actually matched the description of unloadairplane. I'll ensure that I use the correct actions:

- loadairplane p ap l: Load package p in airplane ap. Both p and ap are in location l.
- unloadairplane p ap l: Unload package p from airplane ap in location l.

Also, let me think about constraint 1, which requires p2 to be in l1_2 or in t1. Since our plan has p2 visiting l1_2, this constraint is satisfied. Let me double-check all the constraints:

1. p2 in l1_2 or in t1 - Satisfied by steps 28 and 29.
2. p1 in l2_1 - Satisfied by step 3.
3. If p1 is in l2_1, then at that state or later, p1 should be in l2_5 or p2 should be in l1_3 - Satisfied by steps 3 and 6 (p1 in l2_5 after being in l2_1).
4. Both p2 and p1 in a1 - Satisfied by steps 11, 12, and 17 (both p1 and p2 are in a1 at l1_1).
5. p2 in l1_4 - Satisfied by step 25.
6. p2 in l1_3 or p1 in l1_4 - Satisfied by step 22 (p2 in l1_3).
7. p2 in a1 or p1 in l2_5 - Satisfied by steps 6 and 17 (both p1 in l2_5 and p2 in a1).
8. p1 in a1 - Satisfied by step 11.

So all constraints are satisfied. Let's refine the plan once more to make it as efficient as possible:

1. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_3 (loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3)
2. Move truck t2 from l2_3 to l2_1 (drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2)
3. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1 (unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1) - This satisfies constraint 2
4. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_1 (loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1)
5. Move truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_5 (drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2)
6. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_5 (unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5) - This satisfies part of constraint 3 and part of constraint 7
7. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_5 (loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5)
8. Move truck t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2)
9. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1 (unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1)
10. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1 (flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1)
11. Load p1 onto a1 at l2_1 (loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1) - This satisfies constraint 8
12. Fly a1 from l2_1 to l1_1 (flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1)
13. Move truck t1 from l1_3 to l1_5 (drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_5 c1)
14. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_5 (loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5)
15. Move t1 from l1_5 to l1_1 (drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1)
16. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1 (unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1)
17. Load p2 onto a1 at l1_1 (loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1) - This, combined with p1 already in a1, satisfies constraint 4 and part of constraint 7
18. Unload p2 from a1 at l1_1 (unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1)
19. Unload p1 from a1 at l1_1 (unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1)
20. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_1 (loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1)
21. Move t1 from l1_1 to l1_3 (drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1)
22. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_3 (unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3) - This satisfies constraint 6
23. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_3 (loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3)
24. Move t1 from l1_3 to l1_4 (drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1)
25. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_4 (unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4) - This satisfies constraint 5
26. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_4 (loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4)
27. Move t1 from l1_4 to l1_2 (drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1)
28. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_2 (unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2) - This satisfies constraint 1
29. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_2 (loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2)
30. Move t1 from l1_2 to l1_5 (drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_5 c1)
31. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_5 (unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5) - This achieves the goal for p2
32. Move t1 from l1_5 to l1_1 (drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1)
33. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_1 (loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1)
34. Move t1 from l1_1 to l1_3 (drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1)
35. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_3 (unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3) - This achieves the goal for p1

This plan does satisfy all the constraints and achieve the goal. But I just realized there might be even more efficient plans. For example, is it necessary for p1 to visit l2_5? Let's reconsider the constraints.

Constraint 3 says that if p1 is in l2_1, then at that state or later, p1 should be in l2_5 or p2 should be in l1_3. We can satisfy this by ensuring p2 visits l1_3 after p1 is in l2_1, which is what our plan does.

Constraint 7 says that at some point, either p2 must be in a1 or p1 must be in l2_5. We can satisfy this by having p2 in a1, which our plan also does.

So, p1 doesn't need to visit l2_5. Let's simplify the plan:

1. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_3 (loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3)
2. Move truck t2 from l2_3 to l2_1 (drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2)
3. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1 (unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1) - This satisfies constraint 2
4. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1 (flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1)
5. Load p1 onto a1 at l2_1 (loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1) - This satisfies constraint 8
6. Fly a1 from l2_1 to l1_1 (flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1)
7. Move truck t1 from l1_3 to l1_5 (drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_5 c1)
8. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_5 (loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5)
9. Move t1 from l1_5 to l1_1 (drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1)
10. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1 (unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1)
11. Load p2 onto a1 at l1_1 (loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1) - This, combined with p1 already in a1, satisfies constraint 4 and constraint 7
12. Unload p2 from a1 at l1_1 (unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1)
13. Unload p1 from a1 at l1_1 (unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1)
14. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_1 (loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1)
15. Move t1 from l1_1 to l1_3 (drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1)
16. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_3 (unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3) - This satisfies constraint 3 and constraint 6
17. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_3 (loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3)
18. Move t1 from l1_3 to l1_4 (drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1)
19. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_4 (unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4) - This satisfies constraint 5
20. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_4 (loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4)
21. Move t1 from l1_4 to l1_2 (drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1)
22. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_2 (unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2) - This satisfies constraint 1
23. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_2 (loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2)
24. Move t1 from l1_2 to l1_5 (drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_5 c1)
25. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_5 (unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5) - This achieves the goal for p2
26. Move t1 from l1_5 to l1_1 (drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1)
27. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_1 (loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1)
28. Move t1 from l1_1 to l1_3 (drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1)
29. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_3 (unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3) - This achieves the goal for p1

This plan is more efficient and satisfies all the constraints. Let me double-check it one last time:

1. p2 in l1_2 or in t1 - Satisfied by steps 22 and 23.
2. p1 in l2_1 - Satisfied by step 3.
3. If p1 is in l2_1, then at that state or later, p1 should be in l2_5 or p2 should be in l1_3 - Satisfied by steps 3 and 16 (p2 in l1_3 after p1 is in l2_1).
4. Both p2 and p1 in a1 - Satisfied by steps 5, 6, and 11 (both p1 and p2 are in a1 at l1_1).
5. p2 in l1_4 - Satisfied by step 19.
6. p2 in l1_3 or p1 in l1_4 - Satisfied by step 16 (p2 in l1_3).
7. p2 in a1 or p1 in l2_5 - Satisfied by step 11 (p2 in a1).
8. p1 in a1 - Satisfied by step 5.

All constraints are satisfied, and the goal is achieved with p1 in l1_3 and p2 in l1_5. This is the plan I'll go with.

Let me fix a couple of errors in the step descriptions. For step 3, I mentioned it as a satisfaction of constraint 2, but constraint 2 requires p1 to be in l2_1, which is what this step achieves. For step 16, I mentioned it satisfies constraint 3, which is correct, but I need to be more precise: it satisfies the second part of constraint 3, which says that after p1 is in l2_1, p2 should be in l1_3 at some state.

Let me rewrite the plan one last time, focusing on the actions and omitting the constraint satisfaction explanations:

1. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
2. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
3. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
4. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
5. loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
6. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
7. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_5 c1
8. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
9. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
10. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
11. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
12. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
13. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
14. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
15. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
16. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
17. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
18. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1
19. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
20. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
21. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1
22. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
23. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
24. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_5 c1
25. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
26. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
27. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
28. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
29. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3

This is the optimal plan that satisfies all constraints and achieves the goal.
