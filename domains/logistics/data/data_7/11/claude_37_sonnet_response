Alright, I'm given a logistics planning problem. Let me analyze the initial state and the goal first, and then find a valid plan that meets all the constraints.

Initial State:
- Locations l1_1, l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5 are in city c1.
- Locations l2_1, l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5 are in city c2.
- Package t1 is in location l1_4.
- Package t2 is in location l2_2.
- Package p1 is in location l2_2.
- Package p2 is in location l2_3.
- Package a1 is in location l1_1.
- Package a2 is in location l2_1.

Wait, I notice something unusual here. The state says "Package t1 is in location l1_4", but t1 is defined as a truck, not a package. Similarly, "Package t2 is in location l2_2", but t2 is a truck. Also, "Package a1 is in location l1_1" and "Package a2 is in location l2_1", but a1 and a2 are airplanes. 

I think this is an error, and it should be:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_4.
- Truck t2 is in location l2_2.
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1.
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1.

Let's proceeed with this assumption.

Goal:
The task is to bring about: "Package p1 is in location l1_4" and "Package p2 is in location l2_4".

Constraints:
1. "Package p2 is in location l2_4" must hold in at least one state.
2. Before "Package p2 is in location l2_4", "Package p2 is in location l2_2" or "Package p2 is in location l1_5" must hold.
3. "Package p2 is in location l2_3" must hold in at least one state.
4. After "Package p2 is in location l2_3", "Package p2 is in location l1_3" or "Package p1 is in location l2_1" must hold.
5. "Package p2 is in a2" or "Package p1 is in location l2_5" must hold in at least one state.
6. "Package p1 is in location l2_1" must hold in at least one state.
7. After "Package p1 is in location l2_1", "Package p1 is in location l1_3" or "Package p2 is in location l2_2" must hold.
8. "Package p1 is in location l2_3" must hold in at least one state.
9. "Package p2 is in location l2_2" and "Package p1 is in location l1_3" must hold in at least one state.
10. "Package p2 is in t1" must hold in at least one state.

Alright, we need to plan a sequence of actions that satisfies all the constraints and achieves the goal.

Let's start by figuring out where the packages need to go and how. First p1 needs to go to l1_4, and p2 needs to go to l2_4.

We'll need a truck to move each package locally (within a city), and probably airplanes to move packages between cities.

Let's start with p1. It's initially at l2_2 (city c2) and needs to be at l1_4 (city c1). We'll need to use an airplane to move between cities.

Similarly, p2 is initially at l2_3 (city c2) and needs to be at l2_4 (city c2). Since both are in the same city, we only need a truck for this.

Now, let's consider the constraints and build a plan step by step:

Constraint 1: "Package p2 is in location l2_4" - This is our goal for p2, so it will be satisfied.

Constraint 2: Before "Package p2 is in location l2_4", "Package p2 is in location l2_2" or "Package p2 is in location l1_5" must hold. Since p2 is initially at l2_3, we need to move it to l2_2 or l1_5 before it goes to l2_4.

Constraint 3: "Package p2 is in location l2_3" - This is the initial state for p2, so it's already satisfied.

Constraint 4: After "Package p2 is in location l2_3", "Package p2 is in location l1_3" or "Package p1 is in location l2_1" must hold. So after moving p2 from its initial position, we need to either move p2 to l1_3 or move p1 to l2_1.

Constraint 5: "Package p2 is in a2" or "Package p1 is in location l2_5" must hold at some point.

Constraint 6: "Package p1 is in location l2_1" must hold at some point. This means p1 must be at l2_1, which is an airport in city c2.

Constraint 7: After "Package p1 is in location l2_1", "Package p1 is in location l1_3" or "Package p2 is in location l2_2" must hold. After moving p1 to l2_1, we need to move p1 to l1_3 or ensure p2 is at l2_2.

Constraint 8: "Package p1 is in location l2_3" must hold at some point.

Constraint 9: "Package p2 is in location l2_2" and "Package p1 is in location l1_3" must hold at the same time.

Constraint 10: "Package p2 is in t1" must hold at some point. This means we need to load p2 into truck t1 at some point.

This is a complex problem with many constraints. I'll try to satisfy them step by step.

First, let's determine how to satisfy constraint 10: "Package p2 is in t1" must hold at some point.
Initially, p2 is at l2_3 and t1 is at l1_4. To load p2 into t1, they must be at the same location. This means we need to either:
- Move p2 to l1_4 and load it into t1, or
- Move t1 to l2_3 and load p2 into t1.

Since we need to move packages between cities, the airplanes will come into play. Let's work with the second option.

Plan part 1:
1. Move the airplane a1 from l1_1 to l2_1: flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
2. Move the truck t1 from l1_4 to l1_1: drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
3. Load the truck t1 into the airplane a1: loadairplane t1 a1 l1_1
4. Fly the airplane a1 from l2_1 to l2_1: flyairplane a1 l2_1 l2_1
5. Unload the truck t1 from the airplane a1: unloadairplane t1 a1 l2_1

Wait, I've made a mistake here. We can't load a truck into an airplane. Trucks and airplanes can only carry packages. I need to rethink this.

Let's go back to the constraints and try to plan a sequence of actions that satisfies them.

Constraint 9 states: "Package p2 is in location l2_2" and "Package p1 is in location l1_3" must hold at the same time. This suggests that at some point:
- p1 should be at l1_3 (city c1)
- p2 should be at l2_2 (city c2)

Given the initial positions:
- p1 is at l2_2 (city c2)
- p2 is at l2_3 (city c2)

We need to move p1 from city c2 to city c1, specifically to l1_3. And we need to move p2 from l2_3 to l2_2 (both within city c2).

Let's try planning again:

Plan (version 2):
1. Move the truck t2 from l2_2 to l2_3: drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
2. Load package p2 into truck t2: loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
3. Move the truck t2 from l2_3 to l2_2: drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2
4. Unload package p2 from truck t2: unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
5. Load package p1 into truck t2: loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
6. Move the truck t2 from l2_2 to l2_1: drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
7. Unload package p1 from truck t2: unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
8. Load package p1 into airplane a1: loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
9. Fly the airplane a1 from l2_1 to l1_1: flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
10. Unload package p1 from airplane a1: unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
11. Move the truck t1 from l1_4 to l1_1: drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
12. Load package p1 into truck t1: loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
13. Move the truck t1 from l1_1 to l1_3: drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
14. Unload package p1 from truck t1: unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3

At this point, p1 is at l1_3 and p2 is at l2_2, satisfying constraint 9.

Now, I think I've been confused about the state. Let's clarify again:

Initial State:
- Locations l1_1, l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5 are in city c1.
- Locations l2_1, l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5 are in city c2.
- Truck t1 is in location l1_4.
- Truck t2 is in location l2_2.
- Package p1 is in location l2_2.
- Package p2 is in location l2_3.
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1.
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1.

Goal:
- Package p1 is in location l1_4.
- Package p2 is in location l2_4.

Let's revise the plan to ensure we satisfy all the constraints.

First, let me check constraints 1-10 again to see if there's a particular order or sequence required:

Constraint 1: "Package p2 is in location l2_4" - This is the goal for p2.
Constraint 2: Before p2 is in l2_4, it must be at l2_2 or l1_5. We already have a sequence moving p2 to l2_2.
Constraint 3: "Package p2 is in location l2_3" - This is the initial state.
Constraint 4: After p2 is in l2_3, p2 must be in l1_3 or p1 must be in l2_1. We've planned to move p1 to l2_1.
Constraint 5: "Package p2 is in a2" or "Package p1 is in location l2_5" must hold at some point.
Constraint 6: "Package p1 is in location l2_1" must hold. We've planned to move p1 to l2_1.
Constraint 7: After p1 is in l2_1, p1 must be in l1_3 or p2 must be in l2_2. We've planned to move p1 to l1_3 and p2 to l2_2.
Constraint 8: "Package p1 is in location l2_3" must hold.
Constraint 9: "Package p2 is in location l2_2" and "Package p1 is in location l1_3" must hold. We've planned for this.
Constraint 10: "Package p2 is in t1" must hold. This means we need to move p2 to where t1 is.

Let's revisit constraint 5: "Package p2 is in a2" or "Package p1 is in location l2_5" must hold. We'll need to either load p2 into airplane a2 or move p1 to l2_5.

And constraint 8: "Package p1 is in location l2_3" must hold. We need to move p1 to l2_3.

Let's decide on the complete sequence of actions:

1. p1 is at l2_2, t2 is at l2_2. Load p1 into t2.
2. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_3. This satisfies constraint 8.
3. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_3.
4. Load p2 into t2 at l2_3.
5. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_2.
6. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_2. Now p2 is at l2_2.
7. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1.
8. Load p1 into t2 at l2_3.
9. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1.
10. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1. This satisfies constraint 6.
11. Load p1 into a1 at l2_1.
12. Fly a1 from l2_1 to l1_1.
13. Unload p1 from a1 at l1_1.
14. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1.
15. Load p1 into t1 at l1_1.
16. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_3.
17. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_3. Now p1 is at l1_3 and p2 is at l2_2, satisfying constraint 9. Also p1 is in l1_3 after p1 was in l2_1, satisfying part of constraint 7.

At this point, constraint 10 "Package p2 is in t1" hasn't been satisfied. We need to load p2 into t1. This means p2 and t1 must be at the same location.

Wait, I think I've got confused again. Let's trace the steps more carefully and ensure I'm accounting for the locations of all objects throughout the plan. I'll be more explicit:

Initial State:
- p1 is at l2_2, p2 is at l2_3
- t1 is at l1_4, t2 is at l2_2
- a1 is at l1_1, a2 is at l2_1

1. Load p1 into t2 at l2_2.
Now: p1 is in t2, p2 is at l2_3, t1 is at l1_4, t2 is at l2_2, a1 is at l1_1, a2 is at l2_1.

2. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_3.
Now: p1 is in t2, p2 is at l2_3, t1 is at l1_4, t2 is at l2_3, a1 is at l1_1, a2 is at l2_1.

3. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_3.
Now: p1 is at l2_3, p2 is at l2_3, t1 is at l1_4, t2 is at l2_3, a1 is at l1_1, a2 is at l2_1.
This satisfies constraint 8: "Package p1 is in location l2_3".

4. Load p2 into t2 at l2_3.
Now: p1 is at l2_3, p2 is in t2, t1 is at l1_4, t2 is at l2_3, a1 is at l1_1, a2 is at l2_1.

5. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_2.
Now: p1 is at l2_3, p2 is in t2, t1 is at l1_4, t2 is at l2_2, a1 is at l1_1, a2 is at l2_1.

6. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_2.
Now: p1 is at l2_3, p2 is at l2_2, t1 is at l1_4, t2 is at l2_2, a1 is at l1_1, a2 is at l2_1.
This satisfies constraint 2: Before p2 is in l2_4, it must be at l2_2 or l1_5.

7. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_3.
Now: p1 is at l2_3, p2 is at l2_2, t1 is at l1_4, t2 is at l2_3, a1 is at l1_1, a2 is at l2_1.

8. Load p1 into t2 at l2_3.
Now: p1 is in t2, p2 is at l2_2, t1 is at l1_4, t2 is at l2_3, a1 is at l1_1, a2 is at l2_1.

9. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1.
Now: p1 is in t2, p2 is at l2_2, t1 is at l1_4, t2 is at l2_1, a1 is at l1_1, a2 is at l2_1.

10. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1.
Now: p1 is at l2_1, p2 is at l2_2, t1 is at l1_4, t2 is at l2_1, a1 is at l1_1, a2 is at l2_1.
This satisfies constraint 6: "Package p1 is in location l2_1".
Also, p2 is at l2_2 after p1 is at l2_1, satisfying part of constraint 7.
Also, the condition "Package p2 is at l2_2" holds after "Package p2 is at l2_3", satisfying constraint 4.

I don't think I'm missing anything here. Both p1 and a1 are at l1_1. Let's continue:

11. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_5.
Now: p1 is at l2_1, p2 is at l2_2, t1 is at l1_4, t2 is at l2_5, a1 is at l1_1, a2 is at l2_1.

12. Load p1 into a1 at l2_1.
Hold on, this is incorrect. Airplane a1 is at l1_1, not l2_1. Let's backtrack.

11. Load p1 into a2 at l2_1.
Now: p1 is in a2, p2 is at l2_2, t1 is at l1_4, t2 is at l2_1, a1 is at l1_1, a2 is at l2_1.

12. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
Now: p1 is in a2, p2 is at l2_2, t1 is at l1_4, t2 is at l2_1, a1 is at l1_1, a2 is at l1_1.

13. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1.
Now: p1 is at l1_1, p2 is at l2_2, t1 is at l1_4, t2 is at l2_1, a1 is at l1_1, a2 is at l1_1.

14. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1.
Now: p1 is at l1_1, p2 is at l2_2, t1 is at l1_1, t2 is at l2_1, a1 is at l1_1, a2 is at l1_1.

15. Load p1 into t1 at l1_1.
Now: p1 is in t1, p2 is at l2_2, t1 is at l1_1, t2 is at l2_1, a1 is at l1_1, a2 is at l1_1.

16. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_3.
Now: p1 is in t1, p2 is at l2_2, t1 is at l1_3, t2 is at l2_1, a1 is at l1_1, a2 is at l1_1.

17. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_3.
Now: p1 is at l1_3, p2 is at l2_2, t1 is at l1_3, t2 is at l2_1, a1 is at l1_1, a2 is at l1_1.
This partially satisfies constraint 9: "Package p2 is in location l2_2" and "Package p1 is in location l1_3".
Also, This satisfies part of constraint 7: p1 is at l1_3 after p1 is at l2_1.

I still need to satisfy constraint 5: "Package p2 is in a2" or "Package p1 is in location l2_5" must hold. I'll move p1 to l2_5.

18. Load p1 into t1 at l1_3.
Now: p1 is in t1, p2 is at l2_2, t1 is at l1_3, t2 is at l2_1, a1 is at l1_1, a2 is at l1_1.

19. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1.
Now: p1 is in t1, p2 is at l2_2, t1 is at l1_1, t2 is at l2_1, a1 is at l1_1, a2 is at l1_1.

20. Load p1 into a1 at l1_1.
No, this is incorrect. p1 is already in t1, it's not at l1_1.

Hmm, I think I'm confusing myself. Let's start over and be even more explicit about the states.

Initial State:
- p1 is at l2_2, p2 is at l2_3
- t1 is at l1_4, t2 is at l2_2
- a1 is at l1_1, a2 is at l2_1
- Locations l1_1, l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5 are in city c1.
- Locations l2_1, l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5 are in city c2.

Let's think of a plan where:
1. p1 is at l2_2, move to l2_3 (constraint 8)
2. p1 is at l2_3, move to l2_1 (for constraint 6)
3. p1 is at l2_1, move to l1_3 (for part of constraint 7 and part of constraint 9)
4. p1 is at l1_3, move to l1_4 (goal)
5. p2 is at l2_3, move to l2_2 (for part of constraint 9 and for constraint 2)
6. p2 is at l2_2, move to l2_4 (goal)
7. Also, p2 needs to be loaded into t1 at some point (for constraint 10)
8. Also, p2 needs to be loaded into a2 OR p1 needs to be at l2_5 (for constraint 5)

This will involve moving the trucks and airplanes as needed. Let's draft the plan:

1. Load p1 into t2 at l2_2: loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
   - After: p1 is in t2, t2 is at l2_2
2. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_3: drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
   - After: p1 is in t2, t2 is at l2_3
3. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_3: unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
   - After: p1 is at l2_3, p2 is at l2_3, t2 is at l2_3
   - This satisfies constraint 8: "Package p1 is in location l2_3"
4. Load p2 into t2 at l2_3: loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
   - After: p1 is at l2_3, p2 is in t2, t2 is at l2_3
5. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_2: drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2
   - After: p1 is at l2_3, p2 is in t2, t2 is at l2_2
6. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_2: unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
   - After: p1 is at l2_3, p2 is at l2_2, t2 is at l2_2
   - This satisfies constraint 2 (Before p2 is in l2_4, it must be at l2_2 or l1_5).
7. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_3: drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
   - After: p1 is at l2_3, p2 is at l2_2, t2 is at l2_3
8. Load p1 into t2 at l2_3: loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
   - After: p1 is in t2, p2 is at l2_2, t2 is at l2_3
9. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1: drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
   - After: p1 is in t2, p2 is at l2_2, t2 is at l2_1
10. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1: unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
    - After: p1 is at l2_1, p2 is at l2_2, t2 is at l2_1
    - This satisfies constraint 6: "Package p1 is in location l2_1"
    - Also, p2 is at l2_2 after p1 is at l2_1, which is part of constraint 7.
11. Load p1 into a2 at l2_1: loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
    - After: p1 is in a2, p2 is at l2_2, t2 is at l2_1, a2 is at l2_1
12. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1: flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
    - After: p1 is in a2, p2 is at l2_2, t2 is at l2_1, a2 is at l1_1
13. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1: unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
    - After: p1 is at l1_1, p2 is at l2_2, t2 is at l2_1, a2 is at l1_1
14. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1: drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
    - After: p1 is at l1_1, p2 is at l2_2, t1 is at l1_1, t2 is at l2_1, a2 is at l1_1
15. Load p1 into t1 at l1_1: loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
    - After: p1 is in t1, p2 is at l2_2, t1 is at l1_1, t2 is at l2_1, a2 is at l1_1
16. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_3: drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
    - After: p1 is in t1, p2 is at l2_2, t1 is at l1_3, t2 is at l2_1, a2 is at l1_1
17. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_3: unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
    - After: p1 is at l1_3, p2 is at l2_2, t1 is at l1_3, t2 is at l2_1, a2 is at l1_1
    - This satisfies constraint 9: "Package p2 is in location l2_2" and "Package p1 is in location l1_3"
    - Also, p1 is at l1_3 after being at l2_1, which satisfies part of constraint 7.

At this point, I've satisfied constraints 2, 6, 7, 8, and 9. I still need to address constraints 1, 3, 4, 5, and 10. And I also need to get p1 to l1_4 and p2 to l2_4 (the goals).

Let's continue.

18. Fly a2 from l1_1 to l2_1: flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
    - After: p1 is at l1_3, p2 is at l2_2, t1 is at l1_3, t2 is at l2_1, a2 is at l2_1
19. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2: drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
    - After: p1 is at l1_3, p2 is at l2_2, t1 is at l1_3, t2 is at l2_2, a2 is at l2_1
20. Load p2 into t2 at l2_2: loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
    - After: p1 is at l1_3, p2 is in t2, t1 is at l1_3, t2 is at l2_2, a2 is at l2_1
21. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1: drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
    - After: p1 is at l1_3, p2 is in t2, t1 is at l1_3, t2 is at l2_1, a2 is at l2_1
22. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1: unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
    - After: p1 is at l1_3, p2 is at l2_1, t1 is at l1_3, t2 is at l2_1, a2 is at l2_1
23. Load p2 into a2 at l2_1: loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
    - After: p1 is at l1_3, p2 is in a2, t1 is at l1_3, t2 is at l2_1, a2 is at l2_1
    - This satisfies constraint 5: "Package p2 is in a2" or "Package p1 is in location l2_5"
24. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1: flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
    - After: p1 is at l1_3, p2 is in a2, t1 is at l1_3, t2 is at l2_1, a2 is at l1_1
25. Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1: unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
    - After: p1 is at l1_3, p2 is at l1_1, t1 is at l1_3, t2 is at l2_1, a2 is at l1_1
26. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1: drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
    - After: p1 is at l1_3, p2 is at l1_1, t1 is at l1_1, t2 is at l2_1, a2 is at l1_1
27. Load p2 into t1 at l1_1: loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
    - After: p1 is at l1_3, p2 is in t1, t1 is at l1_1, t2 is at l2_1, a2 is at l1_1
    - This satisfies constraint 10: "Package p2 is in t1"
28. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_3: drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
    - After: p1 is at l1_3, p2 is in t1, t1 is at l1_3, t2 is at l2_1, a2 is at l1_1
29. Load p1 into t1 at l1_3: loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
    - After: p1 is in t1, p2 is in t1, t1 is at l1_3, t2 is at l2_1, a2 is at l1_1
30. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_4: drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1
    - After: p1 is in t1, p2 is in t1, t1 is at l1_4, t2 is at l2_1, a2 is at l1_1
31. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_4: unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
    - After: p1 is at l1_4, p2 is in t1, t1 is at l1_4, t2 is at l2_1, a2 is at l1_1
    - This satisfies part of the goal: "Package p1 is in location l1_4"
32. Fly a2 from l1_1 to l2_1: flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
    - After: p1 is at l1_4, p2 is in t1, t1 is at l1_4, t2 is at l2_1, a2 is at l2_1
33. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1: drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
    - After: p1 is at l1_4, p2 is in t1, t1 is at l1_1, t2 is at l2_1, a2 is at l2_1
34. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1: unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
    - After: p1 is at l1_4, p2 is at l1_1, t1 is at l1_1, t2 is at l2_1, a2 is at l2_1
35. Load p2 into a2 at l1_1: loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
    Wait, a2 is at l2_1, not l1_1. Let me backtrack.

    Actually, I miscalculated in the previous step. Let's start from step 32 again:

32. Load p2 into a1 at l1_1: loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
    - After: p1 is at l1_4, p2 is in a1, t1 is at l1_1, t2 is at l2_1, a1 is at l1_1, a2 is at l1_1
33. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1: flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
    - After: p1 is at l1_4, p2 is in a1, t1 is at l1_1, t2 is at l2_1, a1 is at l2_1, a2 is at l1_1
34. Unload p2 from a1 at l2_1: unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
    - After: p1 is at l1_4, p2 is at l2_1, t1 is at l1_1, t2 is at l2_1, a1 is at l2_1, a2 is at l1_1
35. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4: drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
    - After: p1 is at l1_4, p2 is at l2_1, t1 is at l1_1, t2 is at l2_4, a1 is at l2_1, a2 is at l1_1
36. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1: drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
    - After: p1 is at l1_4, p2 is at l2_1, t1 is at l1_1, t2 is at l2_1, a1 is at l2_1, a2 is at l1_1
37. Load p2 into t2 at l2_1: loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
    - After: p1 is at l1_4, p2 is in t2, t1 is at l1_1, t2 is at l2_1, a1 is at l2_1, a2 is at l1_1
38. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4: drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
    - After: p1 is at l1_4, p2 is in t2, t1 is at l1_1, t2 is at l2_4, a1 is at l2_1, a2 is at l1_1
39. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_4: unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
    - After: p1 is at l1_4, p2 is at l2_4, t1 is at l1_1, t2 is at l2_4, a1 is at l2_1, a2 is at l1_1
    - This satisfies the remaining part of the goal: "Package p2 is in location l2_4"
    - This also satisfies constraint 1: "Package p2 is in location l2_4"

I'm not sure about my calculations in steps 30 to 32:
30. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_4: drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1
    - After: p1 is in t1, p2 is in t1, t1 is at l1_4, t2 is at l2_1, a2 is at l1_1
31. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_4: unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
    - After: p1 is at l1_4, p2 is in t1, t1 is at l1_4, t2 is at l2_1, a2 is at l1_1
    - This satisfies part of the goal: "Package p1 is in location l1_4"

I believe I need to revisit step 32 (re-adding "a1 is at l1_1" to the state):
32. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1: drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
    - After: p1 is at l1_4, p2 is in t1, t1 is at l1_1, t2 is at l2_1, a1 is at l1_1, a2 is at l1_1

I'm still confused about constraint 5: "At least one of the following conditions is true: "Package p2 is in a2", "Package p1 is in location l2_5"." I've been planning to have p2 in a2, but actually I think the aircraft that I'm using is a1:

33. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1: unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
    - After: p1 is at l1_4, p2 is at l1_1, t1 is at l1_1, t2 is at l2_1, a1 is at l1_1, a2 is at l1_1
34. Load p2 into a2 at l1_1: loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
    - After: p1 is at l1_4, p2 is in a2, t1 is at l1_1, t2 is at l2_1, a1 is at l1_1, a2 is at l1_1
    - This satisfies constraint 5: "Package p2 is in a2"

Actually, I see I've been neglecting constraint 3 ("Package p2 is in location l2_3" must hold). p2 is initially at l2_3, so that's already satisfied.

I've been neglecting constraint 4: After p2 is in l2_3, p2 must be in l1_3 or p1 must be in l2_1. The second condition is satisfied, since in our plan, after p2 is at l2_3, p1 is at l2_1 in step 10.

I think I need to validate all the constraints to ensure I'm not missing anything:

- Constraint 1: "Package p2 is in location l2_4" - This is achieved in step 39.
- Constraint 2: Before p2 is in l2_4, it must be at l2_2 or l1_5. p2 is at l2_2 in step 6, before it's at l2_4 in step 39.
- Constraint 3: "Package p2 is in location l2_3" - This is the initial state, so it's already satisfied.
- Constraint 4: After p2 is at l2_3, p2 must be at l1_3 or p1 must be at l2_1. After p2 is at l2_3, p1 is at l2_1 in step 10, satisfying this constraint.
- Constraint 5: "Package p2 is in a2" or "Package p1 is in location l2_5". p2 is in a2 in step 34.
- Constraint 6: "Package p1 is in location l2_1" - This is achieved in step 10.
- Constraint 7: After p1 is at l2_1, p1 must be at l1_3 or p2 must be at l2_2. After p1 is at l2_1, p1 is at l1_3 in step 17.
- Constraint 8: "Package p1 is in location l2_3" - This is achieved in step 3.
- Constraint 9: "Package p2 is in location l2_2" and "Package p1 is in location l1_3" - These conditions are met in steps a and b.

I made a mistake when checking constraint 9: "The following conditions are all true: "Package p2 is in location l2_2", "Package p1 is in location l1_3".
From steps 6 to 16:
- p2 is at l2_2 from step 6 to step 20 (when it's loaded into t2).
- p1 is at l1_3 from step 17 to step 29 (when it's loaded into t1).
So, from steps 17 to 20, both p2 is at l2_2 and p1 is at l1_3, satisfying constraint 9.

- Constraint 10: "Package p2 is in t1" - This is achieved in step 27.

I've checked all 10 constraints and they're all satisfied. I also achieved both parts of the goal: p1 is at l1_4 (step 31) and p2 is at l2_4 (step 39).

Let me now provide the complete plan consisting of all the steps I've outlined:

```
1. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
2. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
3. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
4. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
5. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2
6. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
7. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
8. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
9. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
10. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
11. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
12. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
13. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
14. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
15. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
16. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
17. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
18. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
19. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
20. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
21. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
22. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
23. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
24. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
25. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
26. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
27. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
28. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
29. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
30. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1
31. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
32. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
33. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
34. loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
35. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
36. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
37. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
38. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
39. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
```

Hold on, I think I'm making a mistake here by not being systematic enough in tracking where all objects are at the beginning of the plan. Let me make sure I know where everything is:

1. p1 is at l2_2, p2 is at l2_3
2. t1 is at l1_4, t2 is at l2_2
3. a1 is at l1_1, a2 is at l2_1

But wait, the problem states:
"Package t1 is in location l1_4"
"Package t2 is in location l2_2"
"Package p1 is in location l2_2"
"Package p2 is in location l2_3"
"Package a1 is in location l1_1"
"Package a2 is in location l2_1"

So the original state of the world is a bit confusing. I think t1, t2, a1, and a2 should be "Truck t1", "Truck t2", "Airplane a1", and "Airplane a2" instead of packages. I'll proceed with this assumption.

Initial state:
1. p1 is at l2_2, p2 is at l2_3
2. t1 is at l1_4, t2 is at l2_2
3. a1 is at l1_1, a2 is at l2_1

I think my plan is incorrect in steps 26-29. The truck t1 is at l1_4, not l1_3, after we unload p1 there. Let me revise the plan:

```
1. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
2. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
3. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
4. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
5. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2
6. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
7. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
8. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
9. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
10. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
11. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
12. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
13. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
14. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
15. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
16. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
17. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
18. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1
19. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1
20. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
21. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1
22. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
23. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
24. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
25. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
26. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
27. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
28. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
29. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
30. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
31. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
32. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
33. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
34. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
35. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_3
36. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
37. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
38. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
39. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
40. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
```

Actually, I think I'm overcomplicating things. Let's take a step back and make sure I've understood the initial state and the goal correctly.

Initial State:
- p1 is at l2_2, p2 is at l2_3
- t1 is at l1_4, t2 is at l2_2
- a1 is at l1_1, a2 is at l2_1

Goal:
- p1 is at l1_4, p2 is at l2_4

I'm going to strive for simplicity and make a plan that satisfies all constraints.

1. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
2. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
3. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
   - This satisfies constraint 8: "Package p1 is in location l2_3"
4. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
5. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2
6. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
   - This satisfies constraint 2: Before p2 is in l2_4, it must be at l2_2 or l1_5
7. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
8. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
9. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
   - This satisfies constraint 6: "Package p1 is in location l2_1"
   - Also, p2 is at l2_2 after p1 is at l2_1, which is part of constraint 7
10. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
11. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
12. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
13. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
14. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
    - This satisfies constraint 4: After p2 is at l2_3, p2 must be at l1_3 or p1 must be at l2_1
15. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
16. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
17. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
18. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
19. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
20. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
    - p1 is at l1_3 after being at l2_1, which satisfies part of constraint 7
21. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
22. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
23. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
24. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
25. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
26. loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
    - This satisfies constraint 5: "Package p2 is in a2" or "Package p1 is in location l2_5"
27. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
28. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
    - This satisfies constraint 10: "Package p2 is in t1"
29. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
30. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
    - This satisfies part of the goal: "Package p1 is in location l1_4"
31. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
32. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
33. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
34. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
35. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
    - This satisfies constraint 1: "Package p2 is in location l2_4" and the second part of the goal.

Hmm, I don't think this is right. I'm getting confused with the sequence.

Let's examine constraint 9 more carefully: "The following conditions are all true: "Package p2 is in location l2_2", "Package p1 is in location l1_3"." This means that at some point, p2 should be at l2_2 and p1 should be at l1_3 simultaneously.

Let's plan with a clearer strategy:

1. p1 starts at l2_2. First, move it to l2_3 (constraint 8).
2. p2 starts at l2_3. Move it to l2_2 (part of constraint 9).
   Now p1 is at l2_3, p2 is at l2_2.
3. Move p1 to l2_1 (constraint 6).
   Now p1 is at l2_1, p2 is at l2_2. This also satisfies part of constraint 7: After p1 is at l2_1, p2 is at l2_2.
4. Fly p1 to l1_1 and then drive it to l1_3.
   Now p1 is at l1_3, p2 is at l2_2. This satisfies constraint 9.
5. Load p2 into a2 (part of constraint 5).
6. Load p2 into t1 at some point (constraint 10).
7. Finally, move p1 to l1_4 and p2 to l2_4 (goal).

Let's work this out step by step:

1. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
2. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
3. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
   - Satisfies constraint 8: "Package p1 is in location l2_3"
4. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
5. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2
6. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
   - p2 is at l2_2, which is part of constraint 9
7. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
8. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
9. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
10. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
   - Satisfies constraint 6: "Package p1 is in location l2_1"
   - At this point, p1 is at l2_1 and p2 is at l2_2, which satisfies part of constraint 7: After p1 is at l2_1, p2 is at l2_2
11. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
12. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
13. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
14. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
15. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
16. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
17. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
   - At this point, p1 is at l1_3 and p2 is at l2_2, which satisfies constraint 9
   - This also satisfies the other part of constraint 7: After p1 is at l2_1, p1 is at l1_3
18. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
19. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
20. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
21. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
22. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
   - Satisfies constraint 5: "Package p2 is in a2"
23. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
   Wait, a2 is already at l2_1, we don't need this step.
23. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
24. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
25. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
26. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
   - Satisfies constraint 10: "Package p2 is in t1"
27. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
28. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
   Wait, p1 is not in t1 at this point. Let me backtrack.
27. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
28. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
   Hmm, t1 is not at l1_1 at this point. I'm getting confused again. Let's start over and be very methodical.

I've been overthinking this. Let's approach it more systematically. For each package, we need to determine the shortest path to its goal location, while satisfying all the constraints. Start with the initial state.

Initial state:
- p1 is at l2_2, p2 is at l2_3
- t1 is at l1_4, t2 is at l2_2
- a1 is at l1_1, a2 is at l2_1

1. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
2. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
3. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (constraint 8)
4. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
5. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2
6. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (part of constraint 9)
7. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
8. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
9. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
10. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (constraint 6)
11. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
12. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
13. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
14. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
15. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
16. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
17. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (part of constraint 9 and part of constraint 7)
18. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1 (p1 to goal)
19. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
20. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
21. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
22. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
23. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (constraint 5)
24. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l1_3 c1

Clearly, my approach is flawed. I'll try once more with a clearer head.

Initial state:
- p1 is at l2_2, p2 is at l2_3
- t1 is at l1_4, t2 is at l2_2
- a1 is at l1_1, a2 is at l2_1

Constraints:
- Constraint 1: "Package p2 is in location l2_4" - Goal for p2.
- Constraint 2: Before p2 is in l2_4, it must be at l2_2 or l1_5.
- Constraint 3: "Package p2 is in location l2_3" - Initial state.
- Constraint 4: After p2 is at l2_3, p2 must be at l1_3 or p1 must be at l2_1.
- Constraint 5: "Package p2 is in a2" or "Package p1 is in location l2_5" must hold.
- Constraint 6: "Package p1 is in location l2_1" must hold.
- Constraint 7: After p1 is at l2_1, p1 must be at l1_3 or p2 must be at l2_2.
- Constraint 8: "Package p1 is in location l2_3" must hold.
- Constraint 9: "Package p2 is in location l2_2" and "Package p1 is in location l1_3" must hold at the same time.
- Constraint 10: "Package p2 is in t1" must hold.
