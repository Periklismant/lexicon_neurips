Okay, let's try to figure out this planning problem. Hmm, the goal is to get p1 to l2_3 and p2 to l1_3. There are a bunch of constraints that need to be satisfied along the way. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the initial state. P1 is in l2_1, which is in city c2 and is an airport. P2 is in l1_4 in city c1. The trucks and airplanes: t1 is in l1_2 (city c1), t2 is in l2_5 (city c2). Airplanes a1 is in l1_1 (c1's airport), a2 is in l2_1 (c2's airport). 

So for p1 to get to l2_3, which is in c2. Since l2_1 is an airport, maybe using airplane a2? But wait, p1 starts at l2_1. Wait, l2_1 is an airport in c2. So maybe p1 can be loaded onto a2 and flown to another airport? But l2_3 is a regular location, not an airport. So maybe use a truck in c2 to move it from the airport to l2_3. But wait, the initial location of p1 is l2_1 (airport), so perhaps load it into a truck in c2. But the trucks in c2 are t2, which is in l2_5. So first, need to move t2 from l2_5 to l2_1. Then load p1 into t2, drive to l2_3, and unload. But wait, the initial position of t2 is l2_5. So steps for p1: drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1, load p1 into t2, drive t2 to l2_3, unload p1 there.

But wait, let's check constraints. One of the constraints is that p1 must be in l2_5 at some state. Also, there's a constraint that in some state, p1 is in l2_2. Hmm. So maybe the plan for p1 needs to pass through l2_5 and l2_2. Wait, but how? Because l2_5 is where t2 starts. If we drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1, then to l2_2, then to l2_3? Let's see. But why would we go through l2_5 again? Wait, maybe the constraint is that p1 must be in l2_5 at some point. So maybe after loading p1 into t2, we need to drive t2 to l2_5 first. But how would that work? Let's see. Let's retrace.

Initial state for p1: l2_1. To get to l2_3, using t2 (truck in c2). So steps:

1. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1. (Since t2 starts at l2_5, drive to l2_1 in c2.)
2. Load p1 into t2 at l2_1.
3. Then drive t2 to l2_3. But wait, the cities have locations connected by trucks. In c2, the locations are l2_1 (airport), l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5. So the truck can drive between these. So from l2_1 to l2_2, then to l2_3. But why go via l2_2? Because the constraint says that p1 must be in l2_2 at some state. So perhaps after loading into t2, drive to l2_2, then to l2_3. That way, when unloading in l2_2, p1 is there. Wait, no. If we unload in l2_2, then p1 would be there, but we need to get it to l2_3. So perhaps after loading into t2, drive to l2_5 (to satisfy the constraint that p1 is in l2_5?), but that's not possible unless we unload there. Wait, the constraint says that in some state, p1 is in l2_5. How can that happen? Maybe after loading p1 into t2, drive t2 to l2_5 (but t2 is already in l2_5 initially). Wait, initial position of t2 is l2_5, and p1 is in l2_1. So to get p1 into l2_5, maybe we need to first drive t2 to l2_1, load p1, then drive back to l2_5, unload p1 there (to satisfy the constraint), then drive again to l2_3. But that would add steps. Hmm.

Let me list all constraints to make sure:

Constraints:

1. At least once: p1 is in l2_2.
2. At least once: p2 is in t2 AND p1 is in l2_5.
3. At least once: p1 is in l2_5.
4. At least once: p2 is in a1 or l2_4.
5. At least once: p2 is in a2.
6. At least once: p1 is in t1 or l1_5.
7. At least once: p2 is in l1_4 (its initial location, but the constraint is that this must hold in some state, but after that, if p2 is in l1_4, then it must be in l2_3 at or after that state. Wait, the last constraint says that if in some state s, p2 is in l1_4, then in s or later, p2 must be in l2_3. Since the goal is p2 in l1_3, that's conflicting. Wait, no. The final goal is p2 in l1_3. But the constraint says that if p2 is ever in l1_4 (which it starts in), then at that state or later, it must be in l2_3. But the goal is to have p2 in l1_3, which is different. So this seems like a problem. Wait, the initial state has p2 in l1_4. So the constraint is that if in any state s, p2 is in l1_4 (which is true in the initial state), then in s or later, p2 must be in l2_3. But the goal is p2 in l1_3. So how can that work? Because the initial state s0 has p2 in l1_4. So according to the constraint, in s0 or after, p2 must be in l2_3. But the goal requires p2 in l1_3. So this seems impossible. Wait, but maybe the constraint is only if p2 is in l1_4 in a state s, then in s or later, it must be in l2_3. So the plan must ensure that after the initial state, p2 is moved to l2_3, but the goal requires it to be in l1_3. That's a contradiction. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me recheck the problem statement.

Wait, the final goal is that p1 is in l2_3 and p2 in l1_3. The constraints include:

7. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "Package p2 is in location l1_4""

8. "If expression "Package p2 is in location l1_4" holds in some state s, then expression "Package p2 is in location l2_3" must hold at s or at some state after s"

So constraint 7 requires that p2 is in l1_4 at some state. But the initial state already has p2 in l1_4, so that's satisfied. However, the implication is that if p2 is ever in l1_4 (which it is in s0), then in s0 or later, it must be in l2_3. So the plan must include that p2 is moved to l2_3 after s0, but the goal requires p2 to end up in l1_3. So how can both be true? Because the implication would require that once p2 is in l1_4 (as in s0), then in some later state, p2 must be in l2_3. But the final goal is to have p2 in l1_3. So this seems conflicting. Unless the plan includes moving p2 to l2_3, then somehow back to l1_3. But how?

Wait, maybe the implication is only if p2 is in l1_4 in some state s (after the initial state), then from that state onward, it must reach l2_3. But in the initial state, p2 is in l1_4, so according to the constraint, in s0 or later, p2 must be in l2_3. So the plan must have p2 reach l2_3 at some point. But the final goal is l1_3. So that's a problem. Wait, perhaps the problem is impossible? But the user is asking for a valid plan, so there must be a way. Maybe the constraint is that if after the initial state, p2 is in l1_4 again, then it must go to l2_3. But the initial state is already in l1_4, so the constraint applies. So the plan must have p2 go to l2_3 at some point, but the final goal is l1_3. So p2 has to be moved to l2_3 first, then to l1_3. But how?

Wait, moving from l2_3 to l1_3 would require moving between cities. Because l2_3 is in c2, and l1_3 is in c1. So how to move p2 from c2 to c1. That requires using airplanes. So perhaps p2 is moved from l1_4 (c1) to l2_3 (c2) via airplane, but then back to c1? But how? Let's think.

Alternatively, maybe the plan for p2 is:

From l1_4 (c1), load into a truck (t1 in c1), drive to the airport l1_1, load into airplane a1, fly to l2_1 (c2's airport), unload into truck t2, drive to l2_3. But then p2 would be in l2_3, satisfying the constraint. Then, to get it back to l1_3, we need to fly it back. But that's adding steps. Let's see.

But the goal is to have p2 in l1_3, so after moving it to l2_3, perhaps load it onto another airplane and fly back to c1's airport l1_1, then use truck t1 to drive to l1_3. But this seems complicated. However, the constraints require that p2 is in a2 at some point. Also, p2 must be in a1 or l2_4 at some point. Also, p2 must be in t2. Let's see.

This is getting quite complex. Let's tackle each constraint one by one.

Constraints for p1:

- Must be in l2_2 at some state.

- Must be in l2_5 at some state.

- Must be in t1 or l1_5 at some state.

Wait, but p1 starts in l2_1 (c2), so how can it be in t1 (which is in c1) or l1_5 (c1)? That requires moving p1 from c2 to c1, which would need an airplane. But why would we need to do that? Because the constraint says that p1 must be in t1 or l1_5 at some point. So perhaps part of the plan involves moving p1 to c1, but then back to c2. But the final goal is l2_3. Hmm.

This seems challenging. Let's approach this step by step.

First, let's handle the constraints for p1.

Constraints for p1:

1. At least once in l2_2.

2. At least once in l2_5.

3. At least once in t1 or l1_5.

So for constraint 3, p1 has to be either in truck t1 (which is in c1) or in l1_5 (c1). So p1 needs to be moved to c1 at some point. But p1 starts in c2. To move between cities, we need to use airplanes. So steps for p1:

- Load p1 into airplane a2 (which is at l2_1), fly to l1_1 (c1's airport), unload, then load into truck t1, drive to l1_5, unload. Then, to get back to c2, load into a1, fly to l2_1, unload into t2, drive to l2_3. But this is getting very long.

But maybe there's a shorter way. Let's see.

But the problem says we need an optimal plan, so the shortest possible. So perhaps we can satisfy multiple constraints with the same steps.

For example, moving p1 to l2_5 (constraint 3) when transporting via t2.

But let's outline possible steps for p1:

Initial: p1 in l2_1 (c2).

Constraints for p1:

- Must be in l2_5 (so maybe unload there once).

- Must be in l2_2.

- Must be in t1 or l1_5 (so need to move to c1).

So for p1:

Option 1: Use airplane a2 to fly p1 to c1, then move via truck t1 to l1_5 (satisfies constraint 3), then fly back to c2, move via t2 to l2_3, passing through l2_5 and l2_2.

But this would involve a lot of steps.

Alternatively, maybe use t2 to move p1 from l2_1 to l2_2 (satisfy constraint 1), then to l2_5 (constraint 3), then to l2_3. But how does that satisfy the constraint about t1 or l1_5?

Ah, because that approach doesn't address constraint 3. So p1 needs to be in t1 (c1) or l1_5 (c1). So perhaps p1 has to be transported to c1. Which requires an airplane.

So steps for p1:

1. Load p1 into a2 at l2_1.

2. Fly a2 to l1_1 (c1's airport).

3. Unload p1 into l1_1.

4. Load p1 into t1 (which is in l1_2, but need to drive t1 to l1_1 first? Because t1 starts at l1_2. So drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1.

Wait, initial positions:

- t1 is in l1_2 (c1).

- a1 is in l1_1 (c1's airport).

- a2 is in l2_1 (c2's airport).

So to get p1 from l2_1 (c2) to c1:

- Load p1 into a2 at l2_1.

- Fly a2 to l1_1.

- Unload p1 into l1_1.

Then, to get p1 into t1 or l1_5:

If we load into t1, need t1 to be in l1_1. So drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1.

Then load p1 into t1. Then drive to l1_5, unload. That would satisfy constraint 3 (p1 in t1 and then in l1_5? Or just in t1 satisfies "in t1 or l1_5". So loading into t1 would satisfy the constraint.

Then, to get p1 back to c2 for the final goal:

- Load into a1 (which is at l1_1), fly to l2_1, unload p1 into l2_1.

Then load into t2 (after moving t2 to l2_1), drive to l2_3 via l2_2 and l2_5.

But this is getting really complicated. Let's see how many steps that would be.

Steps for p1:

1. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1, carrying p1? Wait, no, first we need to load p1 into a2.

Wait, initial steps:

In c2, p1 is at l2_1 (airport). So:

1. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (since both are at l2_1).

2. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

3. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1.

Now p1 is in l1_1 (c1's airport).

Then, to load into t1:

4. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 (drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1).

5. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (now p1 is in t1, satisfying constraint 3).

Then, to drive to l1_5:

6. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1.

7. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 (now p1 is in l1_5, which also satisfies constraint 3).

But now we need to get p1 back to c2.

8. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1.

9. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (a1 is in l1_1).

10. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1.

11. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1.

Now p1 is back in l2_1 (c2's airport).

Now, load into t2:

But t2 starts in l2_5. Need to drive t2 to l2_1.

12. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2.

13. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1.

Then drive to l2_2:

14. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2 (p1 is in t2 at l2_2, satisfying constraint 1).

15. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (now p1 is in l2_2).

Then drive to l2_5:

16. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2.

17. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (now p1 is in t2 at l2_5, satisfying constraint 3).

Then drive to l2_3:

18. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_3 c2.

19. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (goal achieved for p1).

This seems way too long, and perhaps not optimal. But maybe there's a shorter way.

Alternatively, after step 7 (p1 in l1_5), perhaps instead of steps 8-11, use another airplane. But no, that's the same.

Alternatively, perhaps after step 5 (p1 in t1), we don't need to drive to l1_5. Because the constraint is "p1 is in t1 or l1_5". So if p1 is in t1, that already satisfies the constraint. So steps 6-7 may not be needed. So after step 5, p1 is in t1, which satisfies constraint 3. Then, we can proceed to unload p1 back into l1_1 and fly back.

But then, steps would be:

1. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1.

2. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

3. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1.

4. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1.

5. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (now p1 in t1: satisfies constraint 3).

6. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1.

7. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1.

8. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1.

9. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1.

Then proceed to load into t2 and move to l2_3 via l2_2 and l2_5.

But this reduces steps. However, after step 5, p1 is in t1, which satisfies constraint 3. Then unloading it in l1_1 (step 6) would remove it from t1. So the constraint is satisfied at step 5.

Now, moving p1 back to c2:

Steps 7-9: load into a1, fly to l2_1, unload.

Then load into t2, which needs to be driven to l2_1.

So:

10. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2.

11. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1.

Then drive to l2_2 (to satisfy constraint 1):

12. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2.

13. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (now p1 in l2_2).

Then drive to l2_5 (to get p1 into l2_5):

14. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2.

15. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (now p1 in t2 at l2_5: satisfies constraint 3 (p1 in l2_5 is part of the second constraint, but here p1 is in t2 at l2_5, but the constraint is that p1 must be in l2_5 in some state. Wait, no: constraint 3 says "Package p1 is in location l2_5". So if we unload p1 in l2_5, then it's there. So perhaps:

After step 15, unload p1 in l2_5:

15. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (now p1 is in l2_5: satisfies constraint 3).

Then reload into t2 and drive to l2_3:

16. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5.

17. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_3 c2.

18. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3.

This way, p1 reaches l2_3.

But this is still many steps. Is there a way to combine some steps?

Alternatively, after step 13 (p1 in l2_2), drive to l2_5 and unload there.

So:

14. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2.

15. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (satisfies constraint 3).

16. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5.

17. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_3 c2.

18. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3.

This way, steps 14-18.

But this would still require 18 steps for p1, which seems excessive. There must be a better way.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a smarter way to satisfy constraints. For example, maybe some constraints can be satisfied in the same step.

Looking at the constraints for p1:

- Must be in l2_2.

- Must be in l2_5.

- Must be in t1 or l1_5.

For p1's movement in c2, perhaps driving t2 from l2_5 to l2_1, load p1, then drive to l2_2 (unload), then drive to l2_3. That way, p1 would be in l2_2 (satisfies constraint 1), and l2_5 (when t2 is there initially). Wait, but how does p1 get to l2_5?

Alternatively, after loading p1 into t2 at l2_1, drive t2 to l2_2 (unload), then drive to l2_5 (unload), then drive to l2_3.

But that would require:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2.

2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1.

3. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2.

4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (satisfies constraint 1).

5. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2.

6. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (satisfies constraint 3).

7. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_3 c2.

8. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3.

But this way, steps 1-8 for p1's part, which is shorter. But how does p1 get into t2? Because initially, p1 is in l2_1. So steps 1: drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (step 1). Then load p1 into t2 (step 2). Then steps 3-8 as above.

But this requires moving t2 to l2_1 first. Then, after that, drive through l2_2 and l2_5, which satisfies the constraints. Then to l2_3. This would satisfy:

- p1 in l2_2 (step 4).

- p1 in l2_5 (step 6).

- But what about the constraint that p1 must be in t1 or l1_5? That's for p1's movement in c1. So perhaps this approach doesn't address that. Because in this plan, p1 is only in c2. So how to satisfy the constraint that p1 must be in t1 (c1) or l1_5 (c1)?

So this plan doesn't satisfy constraint 3 for p1. So it's invalid.

So, we need to find a way to get p1 into c1.

This complicates things. So perhaps the only way is to move p1 to c1, satisfy the constraint, then move back to c2.

But how to do that efficiently.

Let's try to outline steps for p1:

In c2:

- p1 is in l2_1.

- load into a2 (at l2_1).

- fly to l1_1 (c1's airport).

- unload into l1_1.

- load into t1 (drive t1 to l1_1).

- now p1 is in t1 (satisfies constraint 3).

- then unload into l1_1.

- load into a1.

- fly back to l2_1.

- unload into l2_1.

- load into t2.

- drive to l2_2, unload (satisfies constraint 1).

- drive to l2_5, unload (satisfies constraint 3).

- drive to l2_3, unload (goal).

But this involves a lot of steps. Let's count:

1. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1.

2. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

3. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1.

4. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1.

5. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1.

6. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1.

7. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1.

8. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1.

9. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1.

10. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2.

11. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1.

12. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2.

13. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2.

14. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2.

15. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5.

16. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_3 c2.

17. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3.

This is 17 steps for p1 alone. Not even considering p2 yet.

Now, let's look at p2's requirements.

p2 starts in l1_4 (c1). Goal is to get to l1_3.

Constraints for p2:

- Must be in t2 (c2's truck) and p1 in l2_5 at the same time (constraint 2).

- Must be in a2 (airplane in c2's airport l2_1 initially).

- Must be in a1 (c1's airplane) or l2_4 (c2).

- Also, the constraint that if p2 is in l1_4 (which it is initially), then it must be in l2_3 at or after that state. But the goal is l1_3. So this is conflicting unless p2 is moved to l2_3 first, then back to l1_3. But how?

Wait, the final goal requires p2 to be in l1_3. But according to the constraint, after being in l1_4 (initial state), p2 must reach l2_3 at some point. So the plan must first move p2 to l2_3, then somehow bring it back to l1_3. But this seems impossible because moving between cities requires airplanes, and moving back would add steps.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to satisfy the constraint by moving p2 to l2_3 and then back to l1_3, but that's going to require a lot of steps.

Let's think about p2's movement.

p2 starts in l1_4 (c1). Needs to go to l1_3 (c1). But the constraint requires that at some point, p2 is in l2_3. So steps:

1. Move p2 from l1_4 to l2_3 (c2).

2. Then move it back to l1_3 (c1).

But how?

For step 1: Use truck t1 in c1 to move p2 from l1_4 to l1_1 (airport), load into airplane a1, fly to l2_1 (c2's airport), unload into t2, drive to l2_3. Then for step 2: load into airplane a2, fly back to l1_1, unload into t1, drive to l1_3.

But this is many steps.

But let's see:

For p2:

Initial location: l1_4 (c1).

Steps to move to l2_3:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1 (since t1 is in l1_2).

Wait, no. t1 starts at l1_2. To reach l1_4, need to drive through intermediate locations. Are the locations connected directly? The problem says trucks can move between locations in the same city. So presumably, a truck can drive from any location to any other in the same city. So:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1.

2. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4.

3. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 (to the airport).

4. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

5. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1.

6. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1.

7. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1.

8. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 (if t2 is already in l2_1 from previous steps? If not, need to drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1.)

9. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.

10. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2.

11. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (now p2 is in l2_3, satisfying the constraint that after s0, p2 is in l2_3).

Then, to move back to l1_3:

12. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3.

13. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2.

14. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.

15. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1.

16. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

17. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1.

18. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1.

19. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3.

20. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (goal achieved).

But this is 20 steps for p2 alone. Combined with p1's steps, this would be a very long plan. But we need to find a way to merge these steps and satisfy all constraints.

Moreover, there are other constraints to satisfy, like p2 must be in a2 (step 15), must be in a1 or l2_4 (step 5 and 6: p2 is in a1), and in t2 (step 9). Also, the constraint that in some state, p2 is in l1_4 (which is satisfied in s0, but the user's constraint requires that it holds in at least one state, which is already true initially, but maybe the system requires that it's in l1_4 after some actions. Wait, the problem says: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "Package p2 is in location l1_4". The initial state has p2 in l1_4, so this constraint is satisfied. But the implication is that after that, if p2 is ever in l1_4 again, it must be moved to l2_3. But in this plan, p2 is moved out of l1_4 in step 2, so no problem.

Now, combining both p1 and p2's steps, we have to interleave them. But also, there are constraints that require both packages to be in certain places at the same time. For example, constraint 2: "Package p2 is in t2" and "Package p1 is in l2_5" must hold in the same state. So we need to have a state where p2 is in t2 and p1 is in l2_5.

Looking at p1's plan steps, suppose after step 15 (p1 in l2_5), and p2 is in t2 during steps 9-10 (when p2 is loaded into t2). So to have both p2 in t2 and p1 in l2_5, we need to synchronize these steps.

This is getting very complicated. I think the optimal plan must find overlapping steps where possible.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a smarter way to handle the constraints.

Wait, let's consider constraint 2: p2 in t2 and p1 in l2_5 at the same time.

So during the plan, there must be a state where both are true. For p2 to be in t2, t2 must be in some location in c2. For p1 to be in l2_5, it must be unloaded there.

For example, during p1's step where it's unloaded in l2_5 (step 15 in the earlier plan), if p2 is loaded into t2 at the same time, but how?

Alternatively, if p2 is in t2 (loaded in c2's l2_1), and p1 is driven to l2_5 and unloaded there.

But this requires timing.

Alternatively, after p1 is unloaded in l2_5 (step 15), then load p2 into t2 in another city. Wait, no. p2 is in c2's l2_1. So if t2 is in l2_1, p2 can be loaded into t2, then driven to l2_5. But during that drive, p2 is in t2. So if during that drive, p1 is unloaded in l2_5, then in the same state, p2 is in t2 (driving to l2_5) and p1 is in l2_5. But that would require the truck to be in l2_5, so p2 would be in t2 at l2_5. But p1 is also there. So that could work.

So for example:

- p1 is driven to l2_5 and unloaded there.

- At the same time, p2 is in t2, which is driving to l2_5.

But how to synchronize.

Alternatively, after p1 is unloaded in l2_5 (state S1), then p2 is loaded into t2 in l2_5. But t2 would have to be in l2_5. So after p1 is unloaded in l2_5, t2 is there. Then load p2 into t2. But p2 would have to be in l2_5 as well. So this requires moving p2 to l2_5 first.

This is getting too tangled. Perhaps the optimal plan requires a different approach.

Let's consider using airplanes for both packages.

For p2:

From l1_4 (c1) to l1_3 (c1). To satisfy the constraint that p2 must be in l2_3 after being in l1_4, we have to first move p2 to l2_3, then back to l1_3.

But moving p2 to l2_3 requires:

1. Truck t1 picks up p2 from l1_4, drives to l1_1 (airport).

2. Load into airplane a1, fly to l2_1 (c2's airport).

3. Unload into truck t2, drive to l2_3.

Then, to move back to c1:

4. Truck t2 drives p2 back to l2_1, load into airplane a2, fly to l1_1.

5. Unload into truck t1, drive to l1_3.

This satisfies p2's constraints:

- In a1 (step 2).

- In a2 (step 4).

- In l2_4: Not yet. So maybe need a detour.

Wait, one of the constraints is that p2 must be in a1 or l2_4. So during step 3, if we drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4, unload p2 there (satisfying the constraint), then drive to l2_3.

But that adds steps.

So steps for p2:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1.

2. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4.

3. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1.

4. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

5. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (now p2 is in a1: satisfies constraint 4).

6. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1.

7. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1.

8. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2.

9. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (now p2 is in t2: which is needed for constraint 2).

10. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2.

11. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (now p2 is in l2_4: satisfies constraint 4).

12. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2.

13. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (now p2 is in l2_3, satisfying the implication constraint).

Then, move back to c1:

14. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3.

15. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2.

16. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.

17. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (now p2 is in a2: satisfies constraint 5).

18. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

19. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1.

20. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1.

21. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3.

22. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3.

But this is 22 steps for p2 alone. Combining with p1's steps, which are also around 17 steps, this is way too long. There must be a smarter way.

Alternatively, perhaps some constraints can be satisfied with the same action. For example, when p2 is loaded into a2, that satisfies constraint 5. When p2 is in t2, that's part of constraint 2. If during that time, p1 is in l2_5, then constraint 2 is satisfied.

So let's think: when is p2 in t2? For example, when p2 is loaded into t2 in step 9, and p1 is in l2_5. So if during that same state, p1 is in l2_5, then constraint 2 is satisfied.

But how to get p1 to l2_5 at the same time p2 is in t2.

Perhaps interleave the steps:

For p1:

After being flown back to l2_1 (step 9 in the earlier p1 plan), load into t2 (step 11), drive to l2_5, unload (step 15). Then, during that time, p2 is loaded into t2 (step 9 of p2's plan). So if p1 is unloaded in l2_5 (step 15 of p1's plan) and p2 is loaded into t2 (step 9 of p2's plan), then in the state after p2 is loaded into t2 and p1 is unloaded in l2_5, both conditions are met.

But the timing needs to be arranged so that these steps happen in the correct order.

This is extremely complex. Given the time constraints, perhaps the optimal plan is to find the shortest path for each package while satisfying all constraints, and merging where possible.

But given the complexity, perhaps the best approach is to outline the steps for both packages, interleaving them to satisfy all constraints.

Let's attempt a combined plan:

Steps:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1 (to pick up p2).

2. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4.

3. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 (move p2 to airport).

4. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

5. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (now p2 is in a1: satisfies constraint 4).

6. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1.

7. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1.

8. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 (move t2 to airport to load p1 and p2).

9. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (now p2 is in t2: needed for constraint 2).

10. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (p1 is at l2_1 initially).

11. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

12. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1.

13. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1 (drive t1 to l1_3 to later drop p2).

But no, maybe:

After step 12, p1 is in l1_1. Need to load into t1.

13. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (now p1 is in t1: satisfies constraint 3).

14. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (to load into a1).

15. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1.

16. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1.

17. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1.

18. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (now t2 is in l2_1 from step 8).

19. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2 (satisfy constraint 1).

20. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2.

21. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2.

22. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (satisfy constraint 3 for p1).

23. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_3 c2.

24. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (p1's goal).

Now, handling p2:

At step 9, p2 is loaded into t2. Now, need to drive t2 to l2_4 to satisfy constraint 4 (p2 in l2_4).

But steps after step 9 for p2:

After step 9, p2 is in t2 at l2_1.

25. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2.

26. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (satisfies constraint 4).

27. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4.

28. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2.

29. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (satisfies the implication constraint).

Then, move p2 back to c1:

30. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3.

31. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2.

32. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.

33. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (satisfies constraint 5).

34. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

35. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1.

36. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1.

37. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3.

38. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (p2's goal).

But this is 38 steps. Clearly not optimal. There's a lot of back-and-forth.

Perhaps there's a way to combine some steps. For example, when p2 is in t2 and driven to l2_4, then to l2_3, and then fly back.

Alternatively, after step 29 (p2 in l2_3), fly it back to c1.

But this is all very time-consuming.

Given the time I've spent and the complexity, I think the optimal plan involves moving p1 through c1 to satisfy its constraints, while p2 is moved to l2_3 and then back, ensuring all constraints are met. However, this results in a very long plan. But given the problem requires an optimal plan, perhaps there's a shorter way.

Wait, maybe the constraint that p1 must be in t1 or l1_5 can be satisfied by loading p1 into t1 after moving it to c1, without needing to go to l1_5. So for p1:

- Fly to c1's airport, load into t1 (satisfies constraint 3).

Then fly back to c2 and proceed.

This would reduce steps.

Similarly, for p2, the constraint that it must be in l2_3 can be satisfied by moving it there once, then moving it back.

But I'm running out of time. Given the complexity, I'll try to outline a plan that satisfies all constraints with the fewest steps possible.

Here's a possible plan:

For p1:

1. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (p1 in a2).

2. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

3. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1.

4. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1.

5. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (now p1 in t1: satisfies constraint 3).

6. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1.

7. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1.

8. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1.

9. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1.

10. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2.

11. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1.

12. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2.

13. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (satisfies constraint 1).

14. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2.

15. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (satisfies constraint 3).

16. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_3 c2.

17. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (goal).

For p2:

18. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1.

19. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4.

20. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1.

21. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

22. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (satisfies constraint 4 as in a1).

23. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1.

24. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1.

25. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (now p2 in t2: needed for constraint 2, and during this step, p1 is in l2_5 (step 15) which satisfies constraint 2).

26. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2.

27. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (satisfies constraint 4).

28. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4.

29. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2.

30. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (satisfies implication).

31. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3.

32. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2.

33. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.

34. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (satisfies constraint 5).

35. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

36. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1.

37. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1.

38. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3.

39. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (goal).

Now, check constraints:

- p1 in l2_2 (step 13).

- p1 in l2_5 (step 15).

- p1 in t1 (step 5).

- p2 in t2 and p1 in l2_5 (steps 25 and 15).

- p2 in l2_5 (step 15: p1 is there, but p2 is in t2 at step 25, which is different. Wait, no. At step 25, p2 is loaded into t2, which is in l2_1. Then t2 drives to l2_4. So p2 is in t2 during steps 25-27. But p1 is in l2_5 at step 15, which is before p2 is in t2. So these don't overlap. Thus, constraint 2 isn't satisfied. This is a problem.

To satisfy constraint 2, there must be a state where p2 is in t2 AND p1 is in l2_5.

So steps for p2 to be in t2 and p1 in l2_5 must overlap.

In the current plan, p1 is unloaded in l2_5 at step 15. p2 is loaded into t2 at step 25, which happens after. So in the state after step 25, p2 is in t2, but p1 is already in l2_5 (since step 15). So the state after step 25 has p2 in t2 and p1 in l2_5. Thus, constraint 2 is satisfied.

Yes, because after step 15, p1 is in l2_5. In step 25, p2 is loaded into t2 (which is in l2_1). So in the state after step 25, p2 is in t2, and p1 is still in l2_5. So constraint 2 is satisfied.

Thus, this plan satisfies all constraints.

But this is 39 steps. However, the problem asks for an optimal plan with the shortest possible length. Given the complexity, I'm likely missing a more efficient way.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to have p2 go to l2_3 and then directly to l1_3 without returning, but that would violate the implication constraint. Wait, no: the implication constraint requires that if p2 is ever in l1_4, then it must be in l2_3 after. Since p2 starts in l1_4, it must reach l2_3 at some point. The goal is to have it in l1_3, so it must be moved from l2_3 back to l1_3.

But perhaps there's a way to have p2 go to l2_3 and then directly to l1_3 via airplane.

Wait, if p2 is in l2_3 (c2), to get to l1_3 (c1), it needs to be flown to l1_1 (c1's airport), then driven to l1_3.

So steps after p2 is in l2_3:

- load into truck t2, drive to l2_1.

- load into airplane a2, fly to l1_1.

- unload into truck t1, drive to l1_3.

This adds steps, but perhaps merging with other steps.

Overall, given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the earlier plan, ensuring all constraints are met.
