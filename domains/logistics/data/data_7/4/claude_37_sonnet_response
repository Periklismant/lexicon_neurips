Let me analyze this planning problem step by step.

First, I need to understand the initial state:
- We have 2 cities (c1 and c2), each with 5 locations (l1_1 to l1_5 for c1, l2_1 to l2_5 for c2)
- l1_1 is an airport in c1, and l2_1 is an airport in c2
- We have 2 trucks (t1 and t2), 2 airplanes (a1 and a2), and 2 packages (p1 and p2)

Wait, there seems to be a mistake in the initial state description:
"Package t1 is in location l1_2" - t1 is a truck, not a package
"Package t2 is in location l2_5" - t2 is a truck, not a package
"Package a1 is in location l1_1" - a1 is an airplane, not a package
"Package a2 is in location l2_1" - a2 is an airplane, not a package

I'll assume the correct initial state is:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_2
- Truck t2 is in location l2_5
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (airport in c1)
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1 (airport in c2)
- Package p1 is in location l2_1
- Package p2 is in location l1_4

The goal is:
- Package p1 is in location l2_3
- Package p2 is in location l1_3

Now, let's look at the constraints that must be satisfied at some point in the plan:
1. p1 is in location l2_2
2. p1 is in location l2_5 AND p2 is in t2
3. p1 is in location l2_5
4. p2 is in a1 OR p2 is in location l2_4
5. p2 is in a2
6. p1 is in t1 OR p1 is in location l1_5
7. p2 is in location l1_4
8. If p2 is in location l1_4, then p2 must be in location l2_3 at some point after

Now that I understand the problem, I'll start constructing a plan.

Starting with the initial state:
- p1 is in l2_1 (airport)
- p2 is in l1_4
- t1 is in l1_2
- t2 is in l2_5
- a1 is in l1_1 (airport)
- a2 is in l2_1 (airport)

Let's work on the constraints:

Constraint 7 is already satisfied in the initial state (p2 is in l1_4).

For constraint 8, since p2 is initially in l1_4, we'll need to move p2 to l2_3 at some point.

Let's design a plan:

First, I'll move p1 to satisfy constraints 1, 3, and 2 (in that order), and then to its final location l2_3.
- p1 starts at l2_1
- We need to move it to l2_2 (constraint 1)
- Then to l2_5 (constraint 3)
- At this point, we need p2 to be in t2 (constraint 2)
- Finally, move p1 to l2_3 (goal)

For p2:
- p2 starts at l1_4 (constraint 7 satisfied)
- We need to move it to a2 (constraint 5)
- We also need p2 to be in a1 OR in l2_4 (constraint 4)
- Finally, move p2 to l1_3 (goal)

We also need to satisfy constraint 6: p1 is in t1 OR p1 is in l1_5.

Given these constraints, let me plan the movements of p1 and p2:

For p1:
1. p1 starts at l2_1
2. Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1
3. Fly a2 to l1_1
4. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1
5. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_1 (to satisfy constraint 6 - p1 is in t1)
6. Drive t1 to l1_5
7. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_5 (alternate for constraint 6 - p1 is in l1_5)
8. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_5
9. Drive t1 to l1_1
10. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1
11. Load p1 onto a2 at l1_1
12. Fly a2 to l2_1
13. Unload p1 from a2 at l2_1
14. Move p1 to l2_2 (to satisfy constraint 1)
15. Move p1 to l2_5 (to satisfy constraint 3)
16. Ensure p2 is in t2 at this point (for constraint 2)
17. Move p1 to l2_3 (goal)

For p2:
1. p2 starts at l1_4 (constraint 7 satisfied)
2. Load p2 onto t1 from l1_4
3. Drive t1 to l1_1
4. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1
5. Load p2 onto a1 at l1_1 (to satisfy constraint 4 - p2 is in a1)
6. Fly a1 to l2_1
7. Unload p2 from a1 at l2_1
8. Load p2 onto a2 at l2_1 (to satisfy constraint 5 - p2 is in a2)
9. Fly a2 to l2_4
10. Unload p2 from a2 at l2_4 (alternate for constraint 4 - p2 is in l2_4)
11. Load p2 onto t2 from l2_4
12. Drive t2 to l2_5 (when p1 is also in l2_5, to satisfy constraint 2)
13. Drive t2 to l2_3
14. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_3 (to satisfy constraint 8)
15. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_3
16. Drive t2 to l2_1
17. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1
18. Load p2 onto a2 at l2_1
19. Fly a2 to l1_1
20. Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1
21. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_1
22. Drive t1 to l1_3
23. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_3 (goal)

Now, I need to coordinate these actions to ensure all constraints are met at the right times. Let me review the constraints once more:

1. p1 is in location l2_2
2. p1 is in location l2_5 AND p2 is in t2
3. p1 is in location l2_5
4. p2 is in a1 OR p2 is in location l2_4
5. p2 is in a2
6. p1 is in t1 OR p1 is in location l1_5
7. p2 is in location l1_4
8. If p2 is in location l1_4, then p2 must be in location l2_3 at some point after

Now, let me adjust the plan:

I realized there's an issue with my plan. I think I need to be more systematic. Let me start from the initial state and coordinate the movements of both packages to satisfy all constraints.

Initial state:
- p1 is in l2_1 (airport)
- p2 is in l1_4
- t1 is in l1_2
- t2 is in l2_5
- a1 is in l1_1 (airport)
- a2 is in l2_1 (airport)

Let's adjust the plan:

1. First, we need to move t1 to p2:
   - drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1
   
2. Load p2 onto t1:
   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (constraint 7 satisfied: p2 is in l1_4)
   
3. Drive t1 to the airport:
   - drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
   
4. Unload p2 at the airport:
   - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
   
5. Load p2 onto a1:
   - loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (constraint 4 satisfied: p2 is in a1)
   
6. Fly a1 to city c2 airport:
   - flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
   
7. Unload p2 from a1:
   - unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
   
8. Load p2 onto a2:
   - loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (constraint 5 satisfied: p2 is in a2)
   
9. We now need to load p1 (which is at l2_1) onto t2 (which is at l2_5). First, fly a2 (with p2) to l1_1 to get it out of the way:
   - flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
   
10. Drive t2 to the airport to pick up p1:
    - drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
    
11. Load p1 onto t2:
    - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
    
12. Drive t2 to l2_2:
    - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
    
13. Unload p1 at l2_2:
    - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (constraint 1 satisfied: p1 is in l2_2)
    
14. Load p1 onto t2 again:
    - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
    
15. Drive t2 to l2_5:
    - drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
    
16. Unload p1 at l2_5:
    - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (constraint 3 satisfied: p1 is in l2_5)
    
17. Now, we need to get p2 into t2 when p1 is at l2_5 (constraint 2). First, fly a2 (with p2) back to l2_1:
    - flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
    
18. Unload p2 from a2:
    - unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
    
19. Move t2 to the airport to pick up p2:
    - drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
    
20. Load p2 onto t2:
    - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
    
21. Drive t2 back to l2_5:
    - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2 (constraint 2 satisfied: p1 is at l2_5 and p2 is in t2)
    
22. Drive t2 to l2_4:
    - drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2
    
23. Unload p2 at l2_4:
    - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (constraint 4 satisfied: p2 is in l2_4)
    
24. Load p2 onto t2 again:
    - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
    
25. Drive t2 to l2_3:
    - drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2
    
26. Unload p2 at l2_3:
    - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (constraint 8 satisfied: p2 was in l1_4 and now is in l2_3)
    
27. Now, we need to get p1 into t1 or have p1 in l1_5 (constraint 6). Let's move t2 to pick up p1:
    - drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2
    
28. Load p1 onto t2:
    - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
    
29. Drive t2 to l2_3:
    - drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_3 c2
    
30. Unload p1 at l2_3:
    - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (p1 goal satisfied: p1 is in l2_3)
    
31. For constraint 6, we need to get p1 into t1 or have p1 in l1_5. Let's load p1 onto t2 again and take it to l1_5:
    - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
    
32. Drive t2 to the airport:
    - drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
    
33. Unload p1 from t2:
    - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
    
34. Load p1 onto a2:
    - loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
    
35. Fly a2 to l1_1:
    - flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
    
36. Unload p1 from a2:
    - unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
    
37. Move t1 to pick up p1:
    - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_1 c1 (this is a no-op, t1 is already there)
    
38. Load p1 onto t1:
    - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (constraint 6 satisfied: p1 is in t1)
    
39. Drive t1 to l1_5:
    - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
    
40. Unload p1 from t1:
    - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 (alternate for constraint 6: p1 is in l1_5)
    
41. Now, we need to get p1 back to l2_3 and p2 to l1_3 (the goals). First, load p1 onto t1:
    - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
    
42. Drive t1 to the airport:
    - drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
    
43. Unload p1 from t1:
    - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
    
44. Load p1 onto a1:
    - loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
    
45. Fly a1 to l2_1:
    - flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
    
46. Unload p1 from a1:
    - unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
    
47. Move t2 to pick up p1:
    - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_1 c2 (this is a no-op, t2 is already there)
    
48. Load p1 onto t2:
    - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
    
49. Drive t2 to l2_3:
    - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
    
50. Unload p1 from t2:
    - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (p1 goal satisfied: p1 is in l2_3)
    
51. Now, we need to get p2 to l1_3. First, load p2 onto t2:
    - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
    
52. Drive t2 to the airport:
    - drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
    
53. Unload p2 from t2:
    - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
    
54. Load p2 onto a1:
    - loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
    
55. Fly a1 to l1_1:
    - flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
    
56. Unload p2 from a1:
    - unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
    
57. Move t1 to pick up p2:
    - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_1 c1 (this is a no-op, t1 is already there)
    
58. Load p2 onto t1:
    - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
    
59. Drive t1 to l1_3:
    - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
    
60. Unload p2 from t1:
    - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (p2 goal satisfied: p2 is in l1_3)

Looking back at the plan, I realized there may be some errors or inefficiencies. Let me double-check the constraints and adjust the plan:

1. p1 must be in location l2_2 at some point.
2. At some point, p1 must be in location l2_5 AND p2 must be in t2.
3. p1 must be in location l2_5 at some point.
4. At some point, p2 must be in a1 OR p2 must be in location l2_4.
5. p2 must be in a2 at some point.
6. At some point, p1 must be in t1 OR p1 must be in location l1_5.
7. p2 must be in location l1_4 at some point.
8. If p2 is in l1_4, p2 must be in l2_3 at some point after.

Wait, I notice some issues with the plan:
- We're moving packages back and forth unnecessarily.
- The order of constraints isn't always clear.

I think I can simplify the plan. Let's start again:

Initial state:
- p1 is in l2_1 (airport)
- p2 is in l1_4
- t1 is in l1_2
- t2 is in l2_5
- a1 is in l1_1 (airport)
- a2 is in l2_1 (airport)

Constraint 7 is already satisfied because p2 starts in l1_4. Due to constraint 8, p2 needs to go to l2_3 after it's in l1_4, which it already is. Let's start with that.

1. First, move t1 to p2:
   - drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1

2. Load p2 onto t1:
   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (constraint 7 satisfied: p2 is in l1_4)

3. Drive t1 to the airport:
   - drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1

4. Unload p2 at the airport:
   - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

5. Load p2 onto a1:
   - loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (constraint 4 satisfied: p2 is in a1)

6. Fly a1 to city c2 airport:
   - flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

7. Unload p2 from a1:
   - unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

8. Load p2 onto a2:
   - loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (constraint 5 satisfied: p2 is in a2)

9. Fly a2 to l1_1 (to get it out of the way for now):
   - flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

10. Now, let's handle p1. Move t2 to pick up p1:
    - drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2

11. Load p1 onto t2:
    - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

12. Drive t2 to l2_2:
    - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2

13. Unload p1 at l2_2:
    - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (constraint 1 satisfied: p1 is in l2_2)

14. Load p1 onto t2 again:
    - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

15. Drive t2 to l2_5:
    - drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2

16. Unload p1 at l2_5:
    - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (constraint 3 satisfied: p1 is in l2_5)

17. Now, fetch p2 to satisfy constraint 2 (p1 is in l2_5 AND p2 is in t2):
    - flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1 (p2 is in a2)

18. Unload p2 from a2:
    - unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

19. Move t2 to the airport to pick up p2:
    - drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2

20. Load p2 onto t2:
    - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

21. Drive t2 back to l2_5:
    - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2 (constraint 2 satisfied: p1 is at l2_5 and p2 is in t2)

22. Drive t2 to l2_4:
    - drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2

23. Unload p2 at l2_4:
    - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (constraint 4 alternative satisfied: p2 is in l2_4)

24. Load p2 onto t2 again:
    - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

25. Drive t2 to l2_3:
    - drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2

26. Unload p2 at l2_3:
    - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (constraint 8 satisfied: p2 was in l1_4 and now is in l2_3)

27. Now, we have p2 at l2_3, but we need to move it to l1_3 (goal). Let's continue with p1 first. Move t2 to pick up p1:
    - drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2

28. Load p1 onto t2:
    - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

29. Drive t2 to l2_3:
    - drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_3 c2

30. Unload p1 at l2_3:
    - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (p1 goal satisfied: p1 is in l2_3)

31. For constraint 6, we need to get p1 into t1 or have p1 in l1_5. Let's pick up p2 with t2 and then get p1 on the move:
    - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3

32. Drive t2 to the airport:
    - drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

33. Unload p2 from t2:
    - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

34. Load p2 onto a1:
    - loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

35. Fly a1 to l1_1:
    - flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1

36. Unload p2 from a1:
    - unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

37. Move t1 to pick up p2:
    - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_1 c1 (this is a no-op, t1 is already there)

38. Load p2 onto t1:
    - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

39. Drive t1 to l1_3:
    - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1

40. Unload p2 from t1:
    - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (p2 goal satisfied: p2 is in l1_3)

41. Now for constraint 6, we need to move t1 back to the airport to pick up p1:
    - drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1

42. Meanwhile, load p1 onto t2 (where it currently is, at l2_3):
    - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

43. Drive t2 to the airport:
    - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_1 c2 (no-op, it's already there)

44. Unload p1 from t2:
    - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

45. Load p1 onto a2:
    - loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

46. Fly a2 to l1_1:
    - flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

47. Unload p1 from a2:
    - unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

48. Load p1 onto t1:
    - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (constraint 6 satisfied: p1 is in t1)

49. Drive t1 to l1_5:
    - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1

50. Unload p1 from t1:
    - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 (constraint 6 alternative satisfied: p1 is in l1_5)

51. Load p1 onto t1 again:
    - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5

52. Drive t1 to the airport:
    - drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1

53. Unload p1 from t1:
    - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

54. Load p1 onto a1:
    - loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

55. Fly a1 to l2_1:
    - flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

56. Unload p1 from a1:
    - unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

57. Drive t2 to the airport (if it's not already there):
    - drivetruck t2 (current location) l2_1 c2

58. Load p1 onto t2:
    - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

59. Drive t2 to l2_3:
    - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2

60. Unload p1 from t2:
    - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (p1 goal satisfied: p1 is in l2_3)

This is a long plan, but it satisfies all the constraints. Let me check if there are any shortcuts or unnecessary steps.

Actually, I think I'm making a mistake with some of my action specifications. Let me re-read the problem.

Ah, I see. The plan assumes certain sequences of actions that don't match the constraints exactly. Let me revise:

I also notice I'm being inconsistent about where t2 is located at certain points. Let me re-trace the plan more carefully.

Actually, why don't I start over and be more systematic? Let's think of this problem as two tasks:
1. Move p1 from l2_1 to l2_3
2. Move p2 from l1_4 to l1_3

Plus the 8 constraints that need to be satisfied along the way.

I think I can simplify the plan by focusing on one constraint at a time and ensuring that both packages eventually reach their goals.

Let me restart with a cleaner plan:

Initial state:
- p1 is in l2_1 (airport in c2)
- p2 is in l1_4 (in c1)
- t1 is in l1_2 (in c1)
- t2 is in l2_5 (in c2)
- a1 is in l1_1 (airport in c1)
- a2 is in l2_1 (airport in c2)

Constraint 7 is already satisfied because p2 starts in l1_4. Due to constraint 8, p2 needs to go to l2_3 after it's in l1_4, which it already is. Let's build a plan:

1. Move t1 to p2:
   - drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1

2. Load p2 onto t1:
   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (constraint 7 satisfied: p2 is in l1_4)

3. Drive t1 to the airport:
   - drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1

4. Unload p2 at the airport:
   - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

5. Load p2 onto a1:
   - loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (constraint 4 satisfied: p2 is in a1)

6. Fly a1 to city c2 airport:
   - flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

7. Unload p2 from a1:
   - unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

8. Load p2 onto a2:
   - loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (constraint 5 satisfied: p2 is in a2)

9. Meanwhile, move t2 to where p1 is to begin moving it:
   - drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2

10. Load p1 onto t2:
    - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

11. Drive t2 to l2_2:
    - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2

12. Unload p1 at l2_2:
    - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (constraint 1 satisfied: p1 is in l2_2)

13. Load p1 onto t2 again:
    - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

14. Drive t2 to l2_5:
    - drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2

15. Unload p1 at l2_5:
    - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (constraint 3 satisfied: p1 is in l2_5)

16. Now, we need to satisy constraint 2 (p1 is in l2_5 AND p2 is in t2). Fly a2 (with p2) to l2_1:
    - flyairplane a2 l2_1 l2_1 (no-op, a2 is already at l2_1)

17. Unload p2 from a2:
    - unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

18. Load p2 onto t2:
    - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 (constraint 2 satisfied: p1 is at l2_5 and p2 is in t2)

Hmm, step 18 isn't feasible because t2 is at l2_5 but p2 is at l2_1. We need to move t2 to l2_1, but that would move p1 from l2_5.

Let me rethink the sequence...

Actually, let's try to satisfy constraint 6 (p1 is in t1 OR p1 is in l1_5) first:

1. Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1:
   - loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

2. Fly a2 to l1_1:
   - flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

3. Unload p1 from a2:
   - unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

4. Load p1 onto t1:
   - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (constraint 6 partially satisfied: p1 is in t1)

5. Drive t1 to l1_5:
   - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1

6. Unload p1 from t1:
   - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 (constraint 6 fully satisfied: p1 is in l1_5)

Now, let's go back to where we left off:

Wait, I feel like I'm going in circles. Let me try a slightly different approach:

Let's satisfy the constraints one by one, keeping track of the locations of p1 and p2 at each step.

Constraint 7 is already satisfied because p2 starts in l1_4.

For constraint 4, we need p2 to be in a1 OR p2 to be in l2_4. Let's move p2 to a1:
1. Move t1 to p2:
   - drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1
2. Load p2 onto t1:
   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
3. Drive t1 to the airport:
   - drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
4. Unload p2 at the airport:
   - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
5. Load p2 onto a1:
   - loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (constraint 4 satisfied: p2 is in a1)

For constraint 5, we need p2 to be in a2. Let's move p2 to a2:
6. Fly a1 (with p2) to city c2 airport:
   - flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
7. Unload p2 from a1:
   - unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
8. Load p2 onto a2:
   - loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (constraint 5 satisfied: p2 is in a2)

For constraint 1, we need p1 to be in l2_2. Let's move p1 to l2_2:
9. Move t2 to where p1 is:
   - drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
10. Load p1 onto t2:
    - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
11. Drive t2 to l2_2:
    - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
12. Unload p1 at l2_2:
    - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (constraint 1 satisfied: p1 is in l2_2)

For constraint 3, we need p1 to be in l2_5. Let's move p1 to l2_5:
13. Load p1 onto t2 again:
    - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
14. Drive t2 to l2_5:
    - drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
15. Unload p1 at l2_5:
    - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (constraint 3 satisfied: p1 is in l2_5)

For constraint 2, we need p1 to be in l2_5 (which it already is) AND p2 to be in t2. Let's make this happen:
16. Fly a2 (with p2) to l2_1:
    - flyairplane a2 l2_1 l2_1 (no-op, a2 is already at l2_1)
17. Unload p2 from a2:
    - unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
18. Move t2 to l2_1 to pick up p2:
    - drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
(But this would move p1 away from l2_5, which breaks constraint 2).

OK, the constraint 2 is tricky. Let's try a different approach. Let me move p1 to l2_5 at some point, then later move p2 to that location in t2. We'll satisfy constraint 2 when both happen simultaneously.

Let's replan from the beginning:

Initial state:
- p1 is in l2_1 (airport in c2)
- p2 is in l1_4 (in c1)
- t1 is in l1_2 (in c1)
- t2 is in l2_5 (in c2)
- a1 is in l1_1 (airport in c1)
- a2 is in l2_1 (airport in c2)

Constraint 7 is already satisfied because p2 starts in l1_4. Due to constraint 8, we need to move p2 to l2_3 after it's in l1_4.

1. Move t1 to pick up p2:
   - drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1

2. Load p2 onto t1:
   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (constraint 7 satisfied: p2 is in l1_4)

3. Drive t1 to the airport:
   - drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1

4. Unload p2 at the airport:
   - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

5. Load p2 onto a1:
   - loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (constraint 4 satisfied: p2 is in a1)

6. For constraint 5, we need p2 to be in a2. Let's move p2 to a2:
   - flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
   - unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
   - loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (constraint 5 satisfied: p2 is in a2)

For constraint 1, we need p1 to be in l2_2. Currently, p1 is in l2_1. Let's move it:
7. Move t2 to pick up p1:
   - drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2

8. Load p1 onto t2:
   - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

9. Drive t2 to l2_2:
   - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2

10. Unload p1 at l2_2:
    - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (constraint 1 satisfied: p1 is in l2_2)

For constraint 3, we need p1on be in l2_5. Let's move it:
11. Load p1 onto t2 again:
    - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

12. Drive t2 to l2_5:
    - drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2

13. Unload p1 at l2_5:
    - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (constraint 3 satisfied: p1 is in l2_5)

For constraint 6, we need p1 to be in t1 OR p1 to be in l1_5. Let's move p1 to l1_5:
14. Load p1 onto t2 again:
    - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

15. Drive t2 to the airport:
    - drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2

16. Unload p1 from t2:
    - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

17. Load p1 onto an airplane (let's use a1, which should be at l2_1 now):
    - loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

18. Fly a1 to l1_1:
    - flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1

19. Unload p1 from a1:
    - unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

20. Load p1 onto t1:
    - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (constraint 6 partially satisfied: p1 is in t1)

21. Drive t1 to l1_5:
    - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1

22. Unload p1 from t1:
    - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 (constraint 6 fully satisfied: p1 is in l1_5)

For constraint 2, we need p1 to be in l2_5 AND p2 to be in t2. Earlier, we had p1 in l2_5 (step 13), but then we moved it. Let's get p1 back to l2_5 and then bring p2 in t2 to that location:

23. Load p1 onto t1 again:
    - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5

24. Drive t1 to the airport:
    - drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1

25. Unload p1 from t1:
    - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

26. Load p1 onto a1:
    - loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

27. Fly a1 to l2_1:
    - flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

28. Unload p1 from a1:
    - unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

29. Move t2 to pick up p1:
    - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_1 c2 (no-op, t2 is already there)

30. Load p1 onto t2:
    - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

31. Drive t2 to l2_5:
    - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2

32. Unload p1 at l2_5:
    - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

33. Now, we need to bring p2 in t2 to l2_5. First, let's unload p2 from a2 (where it should be currently):
    - unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

34. Move t2 to pick up p2:
    - drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2

35. Load p2 onto t2:
    - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

36. Drive t2 back to l2_5:
    - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2 (constraint 2 satisfied: p1 is at l2_5 and p2 is in t2)

For constraint 8, we need to move p2 to l2_3 after it's been in l1_4 (which it was initially). Currently, p2 is in t2 at location l2_5.
37. Drive t2 with p2 to l2_4:
    - drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2

38. Unload p2 at l2_4:
    - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (constraint 4 alternative satisfied: p2 is in l2_4)

39. Load p2 onto t2 again:
    - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

40. Drive t2 to l2_3:
    - drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2

41. Unload p2 at l2_3:
    - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (constraint 8 satisfied: p2 was in l1_4 and now is in l2_3)

Now, let's move the packages to their final destinations:
- p1 should be in l2_3 (if not already there)
- p2 should be in l1_3

Currently, p1 is at l2_5 and p2 is at l2_3.

42. Move t2 to pick up p1:
    - drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2

43. Load p1 onto t2:
    - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

44. Drive t2 to l2_3:
    - drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_3 c2

45. Unload p1 at l2_3:
    - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (p1 goal satisfied: p1 is in l2_3)

46. Load p2 onto t2:
    - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3

47. Drive t2 to the airport:
    - drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

48. Unload p2 from t2:
    - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

49. Load p2 onto a1:
    - loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

50. Fly a1 to l1_1:
    - flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1

51. Unload p2 from a1:
    - unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

52. Load p2 onto t1:
    - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

53. Drive t1 to l1_3:
    - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1

54. Unload p2 at l1_3:
    - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (p2 goal satisfied: p2 is in l1_3)

I think this plan satisfies all the constraints and goals.  Let me check at which steps I have satisfied each constraint:

Constraint 1: p1 is in location l2_2 - Satisfied in step 10
Constraint 2: p1 is in location l2_5 AND p2 is in t2 - Satisfied in step 36
Constraint 3: p1 is in location l2_5 - Satisfied in step 13 (and again in step 32)
Constraint 4: p2 is in a1 OR p2 is in location l2_4 - Satisfied in step 5 (and again in step 38)
Constraint 5: p2 is in a2 - Satisfied in step 6
Constraint 6: p1 is in t1 OR p1 is in location l1_5 - Satisfied in steps 20 and 22
Constraint 7: p2 is in location l1_4 - Satisfied in step 2
Constraint 8: If p2 is in location l1_4, then p2 is in location l2_3 at some point after - Satisfied in step 41

All constraints are satisfied and both packages reach their goals. I've double-checked the plan and it appears to be valid. It's not the shortest plan possible, but it does satisfy all the constraints and achieves the goals.

Here is the final plan.
