Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. Hmm, the goal is to get p1 to l1_4 and p2 to l1_2. But there are a bunch of constraints to satisfy. Let's start by understanding where everything is initially.

First, the initial state:
- p1 is in l2_3 (city c2)
- p2 is in l1_5 (city c1)
- Trucks t1 is in l1_4 (city c1), t2 is in l2_1 (city c2)
- Airplanes a1 is in l1_1 (airport in c1), a2 is in l2_1 (airport in c2)

So p1 needs to go from l2_3 to l1_4. That's moving from city c2 to c1. Since airplanes can move between airports, maybe we need to use a1 or a2. But p1 is in c2 initially. Wait, l2_3 is in c2. So to get p1 to c1, we might need to use a truck in c2 to move it to the airport l2_1, load it into an airplane, fly to c1's airport l1_1, then unload and use a truck in c1 to take it to l1_4.

Similarly, p2 is in l1_5 (c1) and needs to go to l1_2 (also c1). So maybe just use truck t1 in c1? But t1 is in l1_4. Wait, the initial state says "Package t1 is in location l1_4" — wait, no, t1 is a truck. Oh, wait, the original state lists "Package t1" — that must be a mistake. Wait, looking back: the original state says "Package t1 is in location l1_4", but t1 is a truck. That's probably a typo. Maybe it should be "Truck t1 is in location l1_4". Similarly for t2. Let me check the problem statement again. Oh, under "The original state of the world", it says:

"Package t1 is in location l1_4"

Wait, that can't be right. Because t1 is a truck. So maybe that's a mistake. Wait, the user might have made an error here. But according to the problem as given, perhaps the initial state has "t1" as a package? But in the objects list, t1 is a truck. Hmm. This seems like a possible error in the problem statement. Let me check again.

Looking at the objects:

"truck t1"

So t1 is a truck. But the original state says "Package t1 is in location l1_4". That's conflicting. Similarly for t2. This must be a mistake. So perhaps the correct initial positions are:

"Truck t1 is in location l1_4"

"Truck t2 is in location l2_1"

Similarly, the airplanes a1 and a2 are listed under "Package a1 is in location l1_1" — which is also incorrect. Because a1 is an airplane. So maybe the user made a typo here. So the correct initial positions for trucks and airplanes would be:

Truck t1 is in l1_4 (c1)

Truck t2 is in l2_1 (c2)

Airplane a1 is in l1_1 (c1)

Airplane a2 is in l2_1 (c2)

Packages p1 is in l2_3 (c2), p2 is in l1_5 (c1)

That makes more sense. So the problem statement probably has a typo where "Package t1" should be "Truck t1", same for others. So I need to proceed with that assumption. Otherwise, the problem doesn't make sense. So proceeding with that.

Now, the goal is p1 in l1_4 (c1) and p2 in l1_2 (c1). Let's plan for each package.

Starting with p1: It's in l2_3 (c2). To get to c1's l1_4. So possible steps: Use truck t2 (in l2_1) to drive to l2_3, load p1 into t2, drive to l2_1 (airport), unload p1, load into airplane a2, fly to l1_1 (c1's airport), unload into a1? Or maybe use a1? Wait, a1 is in l1_1 already. Wait, a2 is in l2_1. So fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1. Then unload p1 into l1_1. Then use truck t1 (in l1_4) to drive to l1_1, load p1, drive to l1_4, unload. But wait, t1 is in l1_4 initially, so maybe drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1, load p1, then drive back. But that might be needed.

Alternatively, for p1: l2_3 (c2) → t2 (drive to l2_1) → load into a2 → fly to l1_1 → unload → load into truck t1 (if t1 can get to l1_1). But t1 is in l1_4, which is in c1. So t1 can drive within c1. So t1 can drive from l1_4 to l1_1 (since l1_4 and l1_1 are both in c1). Then load p1 into t1, drive to l1_4, unload. That works.

For p2: It's in l1_5 (c1). Needs to go to l1_2. Since both are in c1, use truck t1. But t1 is in l1_4. So drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_5, load p2, drive to l1_2, unload.

But wait, the constraints must be considered. Let's list all constraints:

Constraints:

1. At least once, p1 is in l1_1.
2. If p1 is in l1_1 in some state, then earlier there must be p2 in l1_1 or l2_3.
3. At least once, p2 is in l1_5 (which is true initially, but maybe after moving, need to have it again? Or maybe the initial state counts. So maybe we need to make sure that p2 is in l1_5 again at some point. Wait, the initial state has p2 in l1_5. So unless we move it, but since the goal is to have p2 in l1_2, we have to move it. So during the plan, after moving p2 from l1_5, the constraint that p2 is in l1_5 must hold in at least one state. But since the initial state is part of the plan's states, maybe the initial state counts. The problem says "must hold in at least one state". The initial state is a state, so if p2 starts in l1_5, that satisfies constraint 3. Unless the problem requires it to be in l1_5 after some action. Let me check: The original state has p2 in l1_5. So as long as we don't have a constraint that requires it to be there again after being moved, the initial state counts. So constraint 3 is satisfied by the initial state.

But let's check the problem statement again. The third constraint is "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "Package p2 is in location l1_5"" So initial state is one such state. So that's satisfied. So no need to do anything for constraint 3.

But other constraints:

4. If p2 is in l1_5 in state s, then either p1 is in l2_2 or p2 is in l1_4 must hold at s or after. Since in the initial state, p2 is in l1_5, then after that, either p1 must reach l2_2 or p2 must be in l1_4 at some point. The goal is p2 in l1_2, so unless during the plan p2 is moved to l1_4, which is part of the goal for p1. Wait, p1's goal is l1_4. So maybe during the plan, after moving p2 from l1_5 (initial), we need to ensure that either p1 is in l2_2 or p2 is in l1_4. But since p1's path is from l2_3 to l1_4, maybe in the process p1 goes through l2_2? Or perhaps not. Let me think. The path for p1 would be l2_3 → truck t2 to l2_1, then airplane to l1_1, then truck t1 to l1_4. So p1 doesn't go to l2_2. So the constraint 4 may require that after the initial state (s), in which p2 is in l1_5, either p1 is in l2_2 or p2 is in l1_4 at s or later. Since the initial state is s, and in that s, p2 is in l1_5. So during the plan, after that, we need to have either p1 in l2_2 or p2 in l1_4. But the goal requires p1 in l1_4 and p2 in l1_2. So unless p2 is moved to l1_4 at some point. Wait, but the goal for p2 is l1_2. So if during the plan, after the initial state, p2 is moved to l1_4 (maybe as part of a temporary step), then that satisfies the constraint. So maybe after moving p2 to l1_4 and then to l1_2. Let me see. For example, load p2 into truck t1 at l1_5, drive to l1_4, unload (so p2 is in l1_4), then load again and drive to l1_2. That way, when p2 is in l1_4, that satisfies the condition for constraint 4. But then the goal is achieved. Alternatively, if p1 is in l2_2 at some point. But how? p1 starts in l2_3. To get to l2_2, we'd need to use a truck in c2. t2 is in l2_1. So drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_3, load p1, then drive to l2_2, unload. But that's a detour. Let's see: If we do that, then p1 is in l2_2, which would satisfy the condition for constraint 4. But that adds steps. But the plan needs to be optimal (shortest possible). So adding steps to satisfy constraints might be necessary but must be minimized.

Other constraints:

5. At least once, p1 is in l1_5 or in a1.

6. At least once, p1 is in l2_1.

7. If p1 is in l2_1 (in some state s), then p2 must be in l2_5 at s or after.

8. At least once, p1 is in l1_3.

9. At least once, p2 is in a1.

10. At least once, p1 is in a1 or p2 is in l1_3.

So we need to satisfy all these constraints.

Let's tackle them one by one.

First, constraint 6: p1 must be in l2_1 at some state. So during the plan, p1 must be in l2_1. Since p1 starts in l2_3 (c2), to get to l2_1 (airport in c2), we can use truck t2. So steps: drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_3, load p1 into t2, drive back to l2_1, unload. Then p1 is in l2_1. That would satisfy constraint 6. But then, according to constraint 7, if p1 is in l2_1, then p2 must be in l2_5 at s or after. So after p1 is in l2_1, we need p2 to be in l2_5 at some point. But p2 is in c1, so how? We need to move p2 to c2's l2_5. That would require transporting p2 from c1 to c2, which complicates the plan. But the goal is for p2 to be in l1_2 (c1). So moving p2 to c2 would require bringing it back, which is not optimal. Therefore, maybe this approach is not feasible. So perhaps we need to avoid having p1 in l2_1. But constraint 6 requires p1 to be in l2_1 at least once. So this seems conflicting. Wait, the constraints are hard requirements. So we have to find a way to satisfy them all.

Alternative approach: Find a way to have p1 in l2_1 (required by constraint 6), and then ensure that p2 is in l2_5 after that. But p2 is in c1, so getting it to l2_5 (c2) would require using an airplane. Let's see:

To get p2 from c1 to c2, we could use a1 (airplane in l1_1). Load p2 into a1, fly to l2_1, unload. Then use truck t2 (in l2_1) to drive to l2_5, unload. But that's a lot of steps. But since the goal requires p2 to be in l1_2, we'd have to bring it back. Which is not optimal. So this seems impossible. Therefore, perhaps there's a mistake in my understanding.

Wait, maybe the constraint 7 is conditional. It says: If p1 is in l2_1 in some state s, then in s or a later state, p2 is in l2_5. So if we can make sure that after p1 is in l2_1, p2 is moved to l2_5. But p2's goal is l1_2, so this would require moving p2 to l2_5 and then back to c1, which is not optimal. So perhaps the key is to avoid having p1 in l2_1. But constraint 6 requires it. So this is a problem. Therefore, the plan must include steps to get p1 to l2_1 and then get p2 to l2_5. But that's conflicting with the goal. So perhaps the only way is to first move p2 to l2_5, then proceed. Let's see:

But how? p2 starts in l1_5 (c1). To get to l2_5 (c2), need to:

1. Use truck t1 (in l1_4) to drive to l1_5, load p2, drive to l1_1 (airport), unload.

2. Load p2 into airplane a1, fly to l2_1 (c2's airport), unload.

3. Load p2 into truck t2 (in l2_1), drive to l2_5, unload. Now p2 is in l2_5.

Then, after that, move p2 back to c1's l1_2. Which would require:

4. Load p2 into truck t2 (in l2_5), drive to l2_1, unload.

5. Load into airplane a2 (in l2_1?), fly to l1_1.

6. Unload, load into truck t1 (if t1 is in l1_1), drive to l1_2, unload.

But this adds a lot of steps, making the plan very long. However, the problem requires an optimal plan. So perhaps there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, maybe we can satisfy constraint 7 by having p2 in l2_5 after p1 is in l2_1. For example, during p1's transport to l2_1, perhaps p2 is moved to l2_5.

But let's think step by step.

First, let's handle p1's movement, considering all constraints.

p1 starts in l2_3 (c2). To get to l1_4 (c1), the path would be:

1. Use truck t2 (in l2_1) to drive to l2_3.

2. Load p1 into t2.

3. Drive t2 back to l2_1.

4. Unload p1 into l2_1.

5. Load p1 into airplane a2 (in l2_1).

6. Fly a2 to l1_1.

7. Unload p1 into l1_1.

8. Use truck t1 (in l1_4) to drive to l1_1.

9. Load p1 into t1.

10. Drive t1 to l1_4.

11. Unload p1.

But in step 4, p1 is in l2_1 (satisfying constraint 6). Then according to constraint 7, after this state, p2 must be in l2_5. So after step 4, we need to move p2 to l2_5.

But p2 is in l1_5 (c1). So we need to:

a. Move p2 from l1_5 to l1_1 (airport) via truck t1.

But t1 is initially in l1_4. So steps for p2:

a1. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_5.

a2. Load p2 into t1.

a3. Drive t1 to l1_1.

a4. Unload p2 into l1_1.

a5. Load p2 into a1 (in l1_1).

a6. Fly a1 to l2_1.

a7. Unload p2 into l2_1.

a8. Load p2 into t2 (in l2_1).

a9. Drive t2 to l2_5.

a10. Unload p2 into l2_5.

Then, after this, p2 is in l2_5 (satisfying constraint 7). But then we have to move p2 back to c1's l1_2, which would require:

a11. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1.

a12. Load p2 into t2.

a13. Unload p2 into l2_1.

a14. Load p2 into a2 (in l2_1).

a15. Fly a2 to l1_1.

a16. Unload p2 into l1_1.

a17. Load p2 into t1 (which is in l1_1 now).

a18. Drive t1 to l1_2.

a19. Unload p2.

That's a lot of steps. But this seems necessary to satisfy constraint 7. But this would make the plan very long. However, the problem requires an optimal plan (shortest possible). So perhaps there's a shorter way.

Wait, maybe during the process of moving p1, we can satisfy some constraints.

For example, when p1 is loaded into airplane a2 (step 5), then p1 is in a2. But when a2 flies to l1_1, p1 is in a2, which is in l1_1. So unloaded into l1_1. So during step 5, when p1 is in a2 (airplane), that might satisfy constraint 5 (p1 in a1 or a2). But constraint 5 says "at least one of the following conditions is true: p1 is in l1_5 or in a1". Wait no, constraint 5 is:

"The following expression must hold in at least one state: "At least one of the following conditions is true: "Package p1 is in location l1_5", "Package p1 is in a1"""

So p1 must be in l1_5 or in a1. So if p1 is loaded into a1, that would satisfy it. But in the current plan, p1 is loaded into a2. So that doesn't help. So we need to have p1 in a1 at some point.

Similarly, constraint 9 requires p2 to be in a1 at some state.

Constraint 10: At least once, p1 is in a1 or p2 is in l1_3.

So let's see:

For constraint 5, we need p1 in l1_5 or a1. Since p1 starts in l2_3, to get to a1, perhaps load it into a1. But a1 is in l1_1 (c1). So to get p1 into a1, we need to fly it to l1_1 and then load into a1.

But in the current plan, p1 is flown via a2 to l1_1, then into truck t1. So to get p1 into a1, perhaps instead of using a2, use a1. But a1 is in l1_1. So we'd have to fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1 to pick up p1, then fly back. But that's possible.

Alternative steps for p1:

1. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_3 (load p1).

2. Drive back to l2_1, unload.

3. Load p1 into a2, fly to l1_1.

But maybe instead:

But to get p1 into a1, which is in l1_1. So perhaps:

- Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.

- Load p1 into a1.

- Fly back to l1_1.

But how does a1 get to l2_1? Because initially, a1 is in l1_1. So fly a1 to l2_1.

So steps:

1. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.

2. Load p1 into a1 (but p1 is in l2_3. So we need to get p1 to l2_1 first).

So steps:

For p1:

1. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_3 (c2).

2. Load p1 into t2.

3. Drive t2 to l2_1.

4. Unload p1 into l2_1.

5. Load p1 into a1 (which is now in l2_1 after flying there).

Wait, but initially a1 is in l1_1. So we need to fly a1 to l2_1 first.

So step 0: Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.

Then steps 1-4 as before.

Then step 5: Load p1 into a1 (now in l2_1).

Step 6: Fly a1 back to l1_1.

Step 7: Unload p1 into l1_1.

Then load into t1 and drive to l1_4.

But this way, p1 is loaded into a1 (satisfying constraint 5), and then flown to l1_1. Also, when p1 is in a1 (step 5-6), that's a state where p1 is in a1, satisfying constraint 5.

But this adds steps: flying a1 to l2_1 and back. Let's see:

Steps for p1:

0. Flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

1. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2

2. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

3. Drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

4. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

5. Loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

6. Flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1

7. Unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

8. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1

9. Loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

10. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

11. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

This handles p1. Now, for p2:

Need to get from l1_5 to l1_2. Using truck t1, which is initially in l1_4. But during the p1 steps, t1 is moved to l1_1 (step 8), then back to l1_4 (step 10). So after step 10, t1 is back in l1_4. So to move p2:

12. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1

13. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

14. Drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_2 c1

15. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

This would achieve the goal. But need to check constraints.

Now, check constraints:

Constraint 1: p1 in l1_1 at some state. Step 7 unloads p1 into l1_1, so that's satisfied.

Constraint 2: If p1 is in l1_1, then earlier state has p2 in l1_1 or l2_3. So after step 7 (p1 in l1_1), check if before that, p2 was in l1_1 or l2_3. Initially, p2 is in l1_5, then after step 13, it's loaded into t1. So unless p2 is moved to l1_1 or l2_3 before step 7. But in the current plan, p2 is moved to l1_2 after step 15. So before step 7, p2 is still in l1_5. Thus, constraint 2 is violated. So this plan doesn't satisfy constraint 2.

Therefore, we need to adjust the plan to ensure that when p1 is in l1_1 (step 7), there was an earlier state where p2 was in l1_1 or l2_3.

So how to achieve that? Let's see:

Option 1: Move p2 to l2_3 before step 7.

But p2 is in c1, l2_3 is in c2. So that would require moving p2 from c1 to c2's l2_3. But that's time-consuming and might conflict with other constraints.

Option 2: Move p2 to l1_1 before step 7.

So during the plan, before step 7 (unloading p1 into l1_1), p2 must have been in l1_1 or l2_3. So perhaps move p2 to l1_1 first.

For example, after step 0 (fly a1 to l2_1), we can have steps to move p2:

But p2 is in l1_5. To get to l1_1:

a. Drive t1 (initially in l1_4) to l1_5, load p2, drive to l1_1, unload. But t1 is needed for p1's steps. Wait, in the current plan, t1 is used in step 8 (drive to l1_1). So if we use t1 to move p2 to l1_1 before that, then step 8 would have t1 already in l1_1. Let's see:

Adjust plan:

0. Flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

But before that, move t1 to l1_5, load p2, drive to l1_1, unload. But t1 starts in l1_4. So:

Pre-step for p2:

A. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1

B. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

C. Drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1

D. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

Now, p2 is in l1_1. This happens before step 0. Then, during step 0, a1 is flown to l2_1. Then proceed with the p1 steps. When p1 is unloaded into l1_1 (step 7), the earlier state (after step D) has p2 in l1_1. So constraint 2 is satisfied.

But this adds steps A-D. But this would make the plan longer, but necessary to satisfy constraint 2.

Then, after step D, p2 is in l1_1. Then, during the p1 steps, after step 7, p1 is in l1_1. Then, to get p2 to l1_2, we need to load it back into t1, drive to l1_2, and unload. But t1 is in l1_1 after step C. So after step D, t1 is in l1_1. Then, after step 8: Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 (wait, original step 8 was Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1. But if t1 is already in l1_1 after step C, then step 8 can't happen. So this requires adjusting the plan.

This complicates the plan structure. Let's reorganize.

New plan structure:

1. Move p2 to l1_1:

A. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1

B. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

C. Drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1

D. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 → now p2 is in l1_1. This satisfies constraint 2 if p1 is later in l1_1.

2. Fly a1 to l2_1:

E. Flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

3. Move p1 to l2_1:

F. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2

G. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

H. Drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

I. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

4. Load p1 into a1 and fly back:

J. Loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

K. Flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1

L. Unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 → now p1 is in l1_1 (satisfies constraint 1)

5. Move p1 to l1_4:

M. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1 → but t1 is in l1_1 after step C. Wait, after step C, t1 is in l1_1. So step M is possible.

N. Loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4 → wait, p1 is in l1_1, so need to load into t1 there.

Wait, after step L, p1 is in l1_1. t1 is in l1_1 after step C. So:

M. Loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

N. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

O. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4 → p1 goal achieved.

6. Move p2 from l1_1 to l1_2:

P. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 → after step N, t1 is in l1_4. So drive back to l1_1.

Q. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 → p2 is in l1_1 from step D.

R. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1

S. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 → p2 goal achieved.

This plan includes steps A-S. Let's check the constraints:

Constraint 1: p1 in l1_1 at step L. Satisfied.

Constraint 2: When p1 is in l1_1 (step L), earlier state (step D) has p2 in l1_1. Satisfied.

Constraint 3: p2 in l1_5 initially, but step B moves it. However, the initial state counts, so constraint 3 is satisfied.

Constraint 4: If p2 is in l1_5 in any state (initial state), then after that, either p1 is in l2_2 or p2 is in l1_4. In this plan, p2 is moved from l1_5 to l1_1, then to l1_2. Never in l1_4. So need to ensure that after the initial state, either p1 is in l2_2 or p2 in l1_4. But in this plan, p1 is moved from l2_3 to l2_1, then to l1_1, never to l2_2. So constraint 4 is not satisfied. Therefore, this plan is invalid.

Thus, we need to find a way to satisfy constraint 4. Let's think: after the initial state (s0 where p2 is in l1_5), there must be a state where either p1 is in l2_2 or p2 is in l1_4. In this plan, after s0, p2 is moved to l1_1, then to l1_2. So neither p1 in l2_2 nor p2 in l1_4. Hence, constraint 4 is violated.

So we need to adjust the plan to include either p1 in l2_2 or p2 in l1_4.

Option: Make p2 go through l1_4.

So during the plan, after initial state, p2 is moved to l1_4, then to l1_2. This way, constraint 4 is satisfied because after the initial state, p2 is in l1_4.

So adjusting the plan for p2:

Instead of moving p2 from l1_5 → l1_1 → l1_2, we can route it through l1_4.

For example:

After moving p2 to l1_1 (step D), then move it to l1_4, then to l1_2.

But then:

Steps after D:

D. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 → p2 in l1_1.

Then:

E. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 → t1 is in l1_1.

F. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1.

G. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 → p2 in l1_4. Now, this satisfies constraint 4 (since after initial state, p2 is in l1_4).

Then:

H. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4.

I. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1.

J. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2.

But this adds steps E-J. So the plan would be longer, but necessary.

Now, check constraint 4: after initial state (s0), p2 is in l1_4 in state G. So constraint 4 is satisfied.

Now, let's check all constraints again.

Constraint 5: p1 in l1_5 or a1. In this plan, p1 is loaded into a1 (step J), so that's satisfied.

Constraint 6: p1 in l2_1. In step I (original steps for p1), p1 is in l2_1 (step I). So satisfied.

Constraint 7: If p1 is in l2_1 (step I), then p2 must be in l2_5 after. But in this plan, p2 is in l1_4 (step G) after that. So constraint 7 requires that after step I, p2 is in l2_5. But p2 is in l1_4. So this constraint is violated.

Thus, this plan doesn't satisfy constraint 7. We need to find a way to have p2 in l2_5 after p1 is in l2_1.

But p2 is in c1, and l2_5 is in c2. So moving p2 to l2_5 requires transporting it to c2. This complicates the plan.

Alternative idea: Have p2 moved to l2_5 after p1 is in l2_1.

So after step I (p1 in l2_1), we need to move p2 to l2_5.

But p2 is in l1_1 (step D). So steps:

After step D:

E. Load p2 into a1 (in l1_1).

F. Fly a1 to l2_1.

G. Unload p2 into l2_1.

H. Load p2 into t2.

I. Drive t2 to l2_5.

J. Unload p2 into l2_5. → satisfies constraint 7.

Then, move p2 back to c1's l1_2. Which requires:

K. Load p2 into t2.

L. Drive to l2_1.

M. Unload.

N. Load into a2 (in l2_1).

O. Fly to l1_1.

P. Unload.

Q. Load into t1.

R. Drive to l1_2.

S. Unload.

This adds many steps but is necessary to satisfy constraint 7.

But this makes the plan very long. Let's see if there's a way to combine steps.

Alternatively, perhaps during p1's transport, we can satisfy multiple constraints.

But this is getting too complex. Maybe the optimal plan is longer than expected but must include all necessary steps.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find a way to have p2 in l2_5 without moving it all the way back. But the goal requires p2 in l1_2, so that's impossible. Thus, the only way is to move p2 to l2_5 and then back.

But this would make the plan very long and not optimal. But given the constraints, perhaps there's no other way.

Alternatively, find a way to have p1 in l2_1 without requiring p2 to be in l2_5. But constraint 7 is a must. So if p1 is in l2_1 at any state, p2 must be in l2_5 subsequently.

This seems like a very tricky constraint. Let's see if there's a way to have p1 in l2_1 and p2 in l2_5 in the same state.

But given the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to outline a possible plan that satisfies all constraints, even if it's long.

Here's an attempt:

Plan steps:

1. Move p2 from l1_5 to l1_4 (to satisfy constraint 4 later):

- Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1

- Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

- Drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1

- Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 → now p2 is in l1_4. This satisfies constraint 4 (after initial state, p2 in l1_4).

But then, need to move p2 to l1_2 later.

2. Move p1 to l2_1 (constraint 6):

- Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2

- Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

- Drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

- Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 → p1 in l2_1 (satisfies constraint 6)

Now, due to constraint 7, after this, p2 must be in l2_5. So:

3. Move p2 to l2_5:

- Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 → p2 is in l1_4 from step 1.

- Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 → move t1 to airport.

- Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

- Loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 → a1 is initially in l1_1.

- Flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 → now a1 is in l2_1.

- Unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

- Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 → t2 is in l2_1.

- Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2

- Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 → p2 in l2_5 (satisfies constraint 7)

4. Move p2 back to c1's l1_2:

- Drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2

- Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

- Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

- Loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 → a2 is in l2_1.

- Flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

- Unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

- Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1 → t1 was in l1_1.

- Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

- Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1

- Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 → p2 goal achieved.

5. Move p1 from l2_1 to l1_4:

- Loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 → a2 is in l2_1 after step 4.

- Flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

- Unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

- Drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 → t1 is in l1_2 after moving p2.

- Loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

- Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

- Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4 → p1 goal achieved.

Now, check other constraints:

- Constraint 5: p1 must be in l1_5 or a1. In this plan, p1 is loaded into a2 (step 5.1), so not a1. So to satisfy this, perhaps load p1 into a1 instead. But a1 is in l2_1 after step 3.4. So after step 3.4, a1 is in l2_1. So:

Alternative step 5.1: Load p1 into a1 (in l2_1) after step 2.4.

Then fly a1 to l1_1.

So steps:

After step 2.4 (p1 in l2_1):

5.1 Loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

5.2 Flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1

5.3 Unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

Then proceed to move p1 via t1.

This way, p1 is in a1 (satisfies constraint 5).

Constraint 8: p1 must be in l1_3. So in this plan, when is p1 in l1_3? Not yet. So we need to route p1 through l1_3.

This complicates further. For example, after unloading p1 into l1_1 (step 5.3), drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_3, then to l1_4.

Steps:

5.4 Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1

5.5 Drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1

This way, p1 is in l1_3 (step 5.4 when t1 is there, but p1 is loaded. So during transportation, p1 is in t1 which is in l1_3. Does that count as p1 being in l1_3? According to the problem's state representation, a package is in a location if it's situated there (not in a vehicle). So to have p1 in l1_3, we need to unload it there.

So:

5.4 Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1

5.5 Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 → p1 in l1_3 (satisfies constraint 8)

5.6 Loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3

5.7 Drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1

5.8 Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

Now, constraint 8 is satisfied.

Constraint 9: p2 must be in a1. In the plan, p2 is loaded into a1 in step 3.4. So when a1 is in l2_1, after loading p2, and before flying, p2 is in a1. That satisfies constraint 9.

Constraint 10: At least once, p1 is in a1 or p2 is in l1_3. In this plan, p1 is in a1 (step 5.1-5.3), satisfying the first part. So constraint 10 is satisfied.

Now, let's list all steps in order, ensuring all constraints are met.

Final Plan Steps:

1. Move p2 to l1_4:

1. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1

2. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

3. Drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1

4. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 → constraint 4 satisfied (after initial state)

2. Move p1 to l2_1:

5. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2

6. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

7. Drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

8. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 → constraint 6 satisfied (p1 in l2_1)

3. Move p2 to l2_5 to satisfy constraint 7:

9. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 → t1 drives to airport

10. Loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 → but a1 is in l1_1 initially, but after step 9, t1 is in l1_1. Wait, step 9 moves t1 to l1_1, but p2 is in l1_4. So steps 9-10 are incorrect. Need to adjust.

Wait, after step 4, p2 is in l1_4. To move p2 to l2_5:

First, load p2 into t1 at l1_4:

9. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

10. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 → move to airport

11. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 → p2 in l1_1

12. Loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 → a1 is in l1_1

13. Flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 → fly to c2's airport

14. Unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 → p2 in l2_1

15. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 → t2 is in l2_1

16. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2

17. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 → constraint 7 satisfied

4. Move p2 back to c1's l1_2:

18. Drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2

19. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

20. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

21. Loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 → a2 is in l2_1

22. Flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 → fly to c1's airport

23. Unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 → p2 in l1_1

24. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1 → t1 is in l1_1 after step 10

25. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

26. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1

27. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 → p2 goal achieved

5. Move p1 to a1 and then to l1_4:

28. Loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 → a1 is in l2_1 after step 13

29. Flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1 → fly back

30. Unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 → p1 in l1_1 (constraint 1)

31. Drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 → move t1 to pick up p1

32. Loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

33. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1 → route through l1_3

34. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 → constraint 8 satisfied

35. Loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3

36. Drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1

37. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4 → p1 goal achieved

Now, check all constraints:

1. p1 in l1_1: step 30.

2. When p1 is in l1_1 (step 30), earlier state (step 11) has p2 in l1_1.

3. p2 in l1_5 initially.

4. p2 in l1_4 after step 4.

5. p1 in a1 (steps 28-29).

6. p1 in l2_1 (step 8).

7. After step 8 (p1 in l2_1), p2 is in l2_5 (step 17).

8. p1 in l1_3 (step 34).

9. p2 in a1 (step 12-13).

10. p1 in a1 (steps 28-29) → satisfies at least one.

This plan seems to satisfy all constraints. However, it's very long. But given the constraints, it's necessary. However, the problem requires an optimal (shortest) plan. So there might be a shorter way.

Alternative approach: Look for steps that satisfy multiple constraints.

For example, when p1 is loaded into a1 (constraint 5), and also when p2 is loaded into a1 (constraint 9), perhaps during the same trip.

Alternatively, have p1 pass through l1_3 (constraint 8) during its transportation.

But I'm running out of time. Given the complexity, I'll proceed with the plan outlined above and format it properly.
