Let me summarize the planning problem:

**Objects**:
- Locations: l1_1 (airport in c1), l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5 in city c1
- Locations: l2_1 (airport in c2), l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5 in city c2
- Cities: c1, c2
- Packages: p1, p2
- Trucks: t1, t2
- Airplanes: a1, a2

**Initial State**:
- t1 is in location l1_4 (This looks like a mistake - trucks should be in locations)
- t2 is in location l2_1 (This looks like a mistake - trucks should be in locations)
- p1 is in location l2_3
- p2 is in location l1_5
- a1 is in location l1_1 (This looks like a mistake - airplanes should be in airports)
- a2 is in location l2_1 (This looks like a mistake - airplanes should be in airports)

I think there's a mistake in the initial state description. Let's assume that:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_4
- Truck t2 is in location l2_1
- Package p1 is in location l2_3
- Package p2 is in location l1_5
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (airport)
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1 (airport)

**Goal State**:
- p1 is in location l1_4
- p2 is in location l1_2

**Constraints**:
1. p1 must be in l1_1 in at least one state
2. If p1 is in l1_1, then p2 must have been in l1_1 or l2_3 earlier
3. p2 must be in l1_5 in at least one state
4. If p2 is in l1_5, then p1 must be in l2_2 or p2 must be in l1_4 at that state or later
5. p1 must be in l1_5 or in a1 in at least one state
6. p1 must be in l2_1 in at least one state
7. If p1 is in l2_1, p2 must be in l2_5 at that state or later
8. p1 must be in l1_3 in at least one state
9. p2 must be in a1 in at least one state
10. p1 must be in a1 or p2 must be in l1_3 in at least one state

Now let's plan for a valid sequence of actions:

First, I need to figure out how to get p1 from l2_3 to l1_4 and p2 from l1_5 to l1_2 while satisfying all constraints.

Let's analyze the constraints to understand what path each package must take:

For p1:
- Start at l2_3
- Visit l2_1 (constraint 6)
- Visit l1_1 (constraint 1)
- Visit l1_3 (constraint 8)
- Visit either l1_5 or be in a1 (constraint 5)
- End at l1_4

For p2:
- Start at l1_5 (which also satisfies constraint 3)
- Visit l1_1 or l2_3 before p1 is in l1_1 (constraint 2)
- Be in a1 at some point (constraint 9)
- Be in l2_5 after p1 is in l2_1 (constraint 7)
- End at l1_2

Additionally:
- We need to satisfy constraint 4: If p2 is in l1_5, then p1 must be in l2_2 or p2 must be in l1_4 at that state or later
- We need to satisfy constraint 10: p1 must be in a1 or p2 must be in l1_3 at some point

Given these constraints, let me try to construct a plan:

1. We start with p1 in l2_3, p2 in l1_5, t1 in l1_4, t2 in l2_1, a1 in l1_1, a2 in l2_1.
2. For constraint 4, since p2 starts in l1_5, we need to ensure p1 visits l2_2 or p2 visits l1_4 later.
3. For constraint 2, we need p2 to visit l1_1 or l2_3 before p1 arrives at l1_1.

Let's try a plan:

1. Drive truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_3 (to pick up p1)
2. Load package p1 into truck t2 at l2_3
3. Drive truck t2 from l2_3 to l2_2 (to satisfy part of constraint 4)
4. Drive truck t2 from l2_2 to l2_1 (airport)
5. Unload package p1 from truck t2 at l2_1 (to satisfy constraint 6)
6. Load package p1 into airplane a2 at l2_1
7. Fly airplane a2 from l2_1 to l1_1
8. Unload package p1 from airplane a2 at l1_1 (to satisfy constraint 1)

But wait, for constraint 2, we need p2 to be in l1_1 or l2_3 before p1 is in l1_1. Let me reconsider.

Let's change the plan:

1. Drive truck t1 from l1_4 to l1_5 (to pick up p2)
2. Load package p2 into truck t1 at l1_5
3. Drive truck t1 from l1_5 to l1_1 (airport)
4. Unload package p2 from truck t1 at l1_1 (this will help satisfy constraint 2)
5. Load package p2 into airplane a1 at l1_1 (this will help satisfy constraint 9)
6. Fly airplane a1 from l1_1 to l2_1
7. Unload package p2 from airplane a1 at l2_1

Then we continue with p1:
8. Drive truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_3 (to pick up p1)
9. Load package p1 into truck t2 at l2_3
10. Drive truck t2 from l2_3 to l2_1 (airport)
11. Unload package p1 from truck t2 at l2_1 (to satisfy constraint 6)

Now, for constraint 7, we need p2 to be in l2_5 after p1 is in l2_1. So:
12. Drive truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_5
13. Load package p2 into truck t2 at l2_1 (actually, we can't do this because p2 is not at l2_1)

Wait, I think I'm making a mistake in trying to construct this plan. Let me redo and be more organized:

Initial State:
- p1 is in l2_3
- p2 is in l1_5
- t1 is in l1_4
- t2 is in l2_1
- a1 is in l1_1
- a2 is in l2_1

Goal:
- p1 is in l1_4
- p2 is in l1_2

Constraints (summarized):
1. p1 must visit l1_1
2. Before p1 visits l1_1, p2 must have visited l1_1 or l2_3
3. p2 must visit l1_5 (already satisfied in initial state)
4. After p2 is in l1_5, p1 must visit l2_2 or p2 must visit l1_4
5. p1 must visit l1_5 or be in a1
6. p1 must visit l2_1
7. After p1 is in l2_1, p2 must visit l2_5
8. p1 must visit l1_3
9. p2 must be in a1
10. p1 must be in a1 or p2 must visit l1_3

Alright, let's create a new plan:

1. Drive truck t1 from l1_4 to l1_5
2. Load package p2 into truck t1 at l1_5 (p2 is already at l1_5 from the initial state, satisfying constraint 3)
3. Drive truck t1 from l1_5 to l1_1 (airport)
4. Unload package p2 from truck t1 at l1_1 (this will help satisfy constraint 2)
5. Load package p2 into airplane a1 at l1_1 (this will help satisfy constraint 9)
6. Fly airplane a1 from l1_1 to l2_1
7. Unload package p2 from airplane a1 at l2_1

Now, for p1:
8. Drive truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_3
9. Load package p1 into truck t2 at l2_3
10. Drive truck t2 from l2_3 to l2_2 (to satisfy part of constraint 4)
11. Drive truck t2 from l2_2 to l2_1 (airport)
12. Unload package p1 from truck t2 at l2_1 (to satisfy constraint 6)

For constraint 7, we need p2 to visit l2_5 after p1 is in l2_1. So:
13. Drive truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_5
14. Load package p2 into truck t2 at l2_1 (actually, we can't do this because p2 is not at l2_5)

Wait, I need to ensure p2 gets to l2_5 after p1 is in l2_1. Let me revise:

1. Drive truck t1 from l1_4 to l1_5
2. Load package p2 into truck t1 at l1_5 (p2 is already at l1_5 from the initial state, satisfying constraint 3)
3. Drive truck t1 from l1_5 to l1_1 (airport)
4. Unload package p2 from truck t1 at l1_1 (this will help satisfy constraint 2)
5. Load package p2 into airplane a1 at l1_1 (this will help satisfy constraint 9)

In the meantime, for p1:
6. Drive truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_3
7. Load package p1 into truck t2 at l2_3
8. Drive truck t2 from l2_3 to l2_2 (to satisfy part of constraint 4)
9. Drive truck t2 from l2_2 to l2_1 (airport)
10. Unload package p1 from truck t2 at l2_1 (to satisfy constraint 6)

Now, for constraint 7, we need p2 to visit l2_5 after p1 is in l2_1. So:
11. Fly airplane a1 from l1_1 to l2_1
12. Unload package p2 from airplane a1 at l2_1
13. Load package p2 into truck t2 at l2_1
14. Drive truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_5
15. Unload package p2 from truck t2 at l2_5 (to satisfy constraint 7)

Continuing with p1's journey:
16. Load package p1 into airplane a2 at l2_1
17. Fly airplane a2 from l2_1 to l1_1
18. Unload package p1 from airplane a2 at l1_1 (to satisfy constraint 1)

For constraint 8, p1 must visit l1_3:
19. Load package p1 into truck t1 at l1_1
20. Drive truck t1 from l1_1 to l1_3
21. Unload package p1 from truck t1 at l1_3 (to satisfy constraint 8)

For constraint 5, p1 must be in l1_5 or a1:
22. Drive truck t1 from l1_3 to l1_5
23. Load package p1 into truck t1 at l1_3
24. Drive truck t1 from l1_3 to l1_5
25. Unload package p1 from truck t1 at l1_5 (to satisfy constraint 5)

For constraint 10, p1 must be in a1 or p2 must be in l1_3. We can satisfy this by:
26. Drive truck t1 from l1_5 to l1_1
27. Load package p1 into truck t1 at l1_5
28. Drive truck t1 from l1_5 to l1_1
29. Unload package p1 from truck t1 at l1_1
30. Load package p1 into airplane a1 at l1_1 (satisfying constraint 10)

For the goal, p1 needs to be in l1_4 and p2 needs to be in l1_2:
31. Unload package p1 from airplane a1 at l1_1
32. Load package p1 into truck t1 at l1_1
33. Drive truck t1 from l1_1 to l1_4
34. Unload package p1 from truck t1 at l1_4 (part of the goal)

For p2 to get to l1_2, we need to bring it back from l2_5:
35. Drive truck t2 from l2_5 to l2_1
36. Load package p2 into truck t2 at l2_5
37. Drive truck t2 from l2_5 to l2_1
38. Unload package p2 from truck t2 at l2_1
39. Load package p2 into airplane a2 at l2_1
40. Fly airplane a2 from l2_1 to l1_1
41. Unload package p2 from airplane a2 at l1_1
42. Load package p2 into truck t1 at l1_1
43. Drive truck t1 from l1_4 to l1_2 (actually, t1 is not in l1_4 at this step, let me fix this)

Wait, I need to check where each object is at each step and ensure the plan is coherent. Let me re-do this more carefully.

Initial State:
- p1 is in l2_3
- p2 is in l1_5
- t1 is in l1_4
- t2 is in l2_1
- a1 is in l1_1
- a2 is in l2_1

Goal:
- p1 is in l1_4
- p2 is in l1_2

I'll create a step-by-step plan, tracking where each object is after each action.

    - p1 is in l1_4, p2 is in a2, t1 is in l1_1, t2 is in l2_1, a1 is in l2_1, a2 is in l1_1

Wait, that can't be right. Let me double-check the locations of the objects at each step. I think I've made a mistake.

Let me restart more carefully:

Initial State:
- p1 is in l2_3
- p2 is in l1_5
- t1 is in l1_4
- t2 is in l2_1
- a1 is in l1_1 (airport)
- a2 is in l2_1 (airport)

Goal:
- p1 is in l1_4
- p2 is in l1_2

First part of the plan:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1
2. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 (satisfying constraint 3)
3. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1 (to reach the airport)
4. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (to satisfy part of constraint 2)
5. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (to satisfy constraint 9)
6. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
7. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

To handle p1:
8. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
9. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
10. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2 (to satisfy part of constraint 4)
11. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
12. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
13. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
14. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (to satisfy constraint 6)

For constraint 7, after p1 is in l2_1, p2 needs to be in l2_5:
15. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
16. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
17. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 (to satisfy constraint 7)

Continue with p1:
18. loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
19. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
20. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (to satisfy constraint 1)

Drive to l1_3:
21. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
22. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
23. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (to satisfy constraint 8)

For constraint 5, p1 must visit l1_5 or be in a1 (we already had p1 in a1, so this is satisfied)

Now, for the goal, p1 must be in l1_4:
24. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
25. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1
26. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4 (part of the goal)

For p2 to be in l1_2:
27. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
28. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
29. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
30. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
31. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
32. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
33. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
34. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
35. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
36. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
37. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (part of the goal)

Now, let's check if we've satisfied all the constraints:

1. ✓ p1 was in l1_1
2. ✓ Before p1 was in l1_1, p2 was in l1_1
3. ✓ p2 was in l1_5 (initial state)
4. ✓ After p2 was in l1_5, p1 was in l2_2
5. ✓ p1 was in a1
6. ✓ p1 was in l2_1
7. ✓ After p1 was in l2_1, p2 was in l2_5
8. ✓ p1 was in l1_3
9. ✓ p2 was in a1
10. ✓ p1 was in a1

Hmm, there's something that doesn't seem right in our plan. Let me review:

Reviewing our plan:
- The constraint 4 says that if p2 is in l1_5, then p1 must be in l2_2 or p2 must be in l1_4 at that state or later.
- p2 is initially in l1_5, so p1 must be in l2_2 or p2 must be in l1_4 at some point. Our plan ensures p1 visits l2_2.
- Constraint 10 requires p1 to be in a1 or p2 to be in l1_3 at some point. Our plan ensures p1 is in a1.

Actually, let's modify the plan to ensure p2 passes through l1_3 to satisfy constraint 10 more clearly:

First part of the plan:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1
2. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 (satisfying constraint 3)
3. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1 (to satisfy constraint 10)
4. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1 (to reach the airport)
5. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (to satisfy part of constraint 2)
6. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (to satisfy constraint 9)
7. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
8. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

To handle p1:
9. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
10. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
11. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2 (to satisfy part of constraint 4)
12. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
13. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
14. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
15. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (to satisfy constraint 6)

For constraint 7, after p1 is in l2_1, p2 needs to be in l2_5:
16. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
17. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
18. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 (to satisfy constraint 7)

Continue with p1:
19. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
20. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
21. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (to satisfy constraint 1)

Drive to l1_3:
22. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
23. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
24. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (to satisfy constraint 8)

For constraint 5, p1 must visit l1_5 or be in a1:
25. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
26. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_5 c1
27. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 (to satisfy constraint 5)

Now, for the goal, p1 must be in l1_4:
28. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
29. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1
30. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4 (part of the goal)

For p2 to be in l1_2:
31. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
32. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
33. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
34. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
35. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
36. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
37. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
38. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
39. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
40. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
41. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
42. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (part of the goal)

Actually, this doesn't quite work yet. Let me revise:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1
2. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 (satisfying constraint 3)
3. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1 (to satisfy constraint 10)
4. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1 (to reach the airport)
5. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (to satisfy part of constraint 2)
6. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (to satisfy constraint 9)
7. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
8. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

To handle p1:
9. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
10. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
11. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2 (to satisfy part of constraint 4)
12. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
13. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
14. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
15. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (to satisfy constraint 6)

For constraint 7, after p1 is in l2_1, p2 needs to be in l2_5:
16. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
17. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
18. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 (to satisfy constraint 7)

Continue with p1:
19. loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
20. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
21. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (to satisfy constraint 1)

Drive to l1_3:
22. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
23. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
24. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (to satisfy constraint 8)

For constraint 5, p1 must visit l1_5 or be in a1 (we've already had p1 in a1, so this is satisfied, but for completeness, let's visit l1_5 too):
25. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
26. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_5 c1
27. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5

Now, for the goal, p1 must be in l1_4:
28. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
29. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1
30. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4 (part of the goal)

For p2 to be in l1_2, first we need to get it from l2_5:
31. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
32. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
33. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
34. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
35. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
36. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
37. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
38. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
39. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
40. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
41. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
42. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (part of the goal)

Let me make a few more corrections:

- In step 32, we're trying to fly airplane a2 from l1_1 to l2_1, but we haven't moved a2 from its initial position at l2_1. So, instead, we should have a2 already at l1_1 by flying it from l2_1 to l1_1 before step 32. But this seems unnecessary since we can just use a1 for the return journey.

Let me make a cleaner plan:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1
2. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 (satisfying constraint 3)
3. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1 (to satisfy constraint 10)
4. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1 (to reach the airport)
5. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (to satisfy part of constraint 2)
6. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (to satisfy constraint 9)
7. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
8. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

9. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
10. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
11. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2 (to satisfy part of constraint 4)
12. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
13. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
14. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
15. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
16. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (to satisfy constraint 6)

17. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
18. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
19. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 (to satisfy constraint 7)

20. loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
21. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
22. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (to satisfy constraint 1)

23. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
24. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
25. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (to satisfy constraint 8)

26. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
27. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1
28. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4 (part of the goal)

29. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
30. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
31. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
32. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
33. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
34. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
35. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
36. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
37. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
38. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
39. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (part of the goal)

Actually, wait, in step 14, we're trying to load p1 into truck t2 at location l2_2, but at this point, p1 should already be unloaded at l2_2 from step 12. I think I've got confused, so I'll be more meticulous:

Let's say after step 12, we have:
- p1 is in l2_2
- p2 is in l2_1
- t1 is in l1_1
- t2 is in l2_2
- a1 is in l2_1
- a2 is in l2_1

13. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
14. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (not correct, p1 is in l2_2, not l2_1)

Actually, let me just redo this whole sequence step-by-step, tracking where every object is:

Initial state:
- p1 is in l2_3
- p2 is in l1_5
- t1 is in l1_4
- t2 is in l2_1

    - p1 is in l1_4, p2 is in l1_2, t1 is in l1_2, t2 is in l2_1, a1 is in l1_1, a2 is in l1_1

OK, this looks like a valid plan that should achieve our goals. Let's check the constraints one by one:

1. ✓ p1 was in l1_1 (step 22)
2. ✓ Before p1 was in l1_1, p2 was in l1_1 (step 5)
3. ✓ p2 was in l1_5 (initial state)
4. ✓ After p2 was in l1_5, p1 was in l2_2 (step 12)
5. ✓ p1 was in l1_5 (step 28)
6. ✓ p1 was in l2_1 (step 15)
7. ✓ After p1 was in l2_1, p2 was in l2_5 (step 18)
8. ✓ p1 was in l1_3 (step 25)
9. ✓ p2 was in a1 (step 6)
10. ✓ p1 was in a1 (step 20)

And our goal state:
- ✓ p1 is in l1_4 (step 31)
- ✓ p2 is in l1_2 (step 42)

Great, so we have a plan that achieves our goals and satisfies all the constraints. Actually, I feel i'm making the plan very complicated by insisting on satisfying constraint 10 by having both p1 being in a1 and p2 being in l1_3 but the constraint is an OR, so we only need one of these to be true. We can potentially simplify our plan. Let me see...

We can simplify steps 3-4, by removing the detour through l1_3:
3. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1

We already satisfy constraint 10 by having p1 in a1 during step 20, so we don't need p2 to be in l1_3.

But checking, I see that, we still need to have p1 to come back to l1_3 (constraint 8), so this deviation is still required even if we don't use it for p2.

Following this logic again, our final plan is:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1
2. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
3. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
4. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
5. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
6. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
7. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
8. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
9. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
10. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2
11. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
12. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
13. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
14. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
15. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
16. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
17. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
18. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
19. loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
20. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
21. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
22. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
23. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
24. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
25. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
26. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_5 c1
27. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
28. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
29. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1
30. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
31. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
32. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
33. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
34. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
35. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
36. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
37. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
38. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
39. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
40. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
41. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

Let me check if we can combine some operations:

- After step 14, we immediately load p2 into t2 at l2_1. This is OK.
- After step 24, we immediately load p1 into t1 at l1_3. This is OK.
- After step 27, we immediately load p1 into t1 at l1_5. This is OK.

Final answer:
