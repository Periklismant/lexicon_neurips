Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. So, the goal is to get p1 to l1_1 and p2 to l1_4. There's a bunch of constraints to satisfy along the way. Let me break this down step by step.

First, let's look at the initial state. P1 is in l2_5 (city c2), and p2 is in l2_2 (also c2). The airports are l1_1 (c1) and l2_1 (c2). Trucks t1 is in l1_2 (c1), t2 in l2_1 (c2). Airplanes a1 is in l1_1 (c1), a2 in l2_1 (c2). So, moving packages between cities probably needs airplanes, while within cities, trucks can handle it.

For p1 to get to l1_1 (which is an airport in c1), it needs to be flown from c2 to c1. Since p1 is in l2_5 (c2), first, we need to move it to an airport in c2, which is l2_1. Then load it onto an airplane (a2 is at l2_1), fly to l1_1, unload, and done. But wait, the airplane a2 is already at l2_1, so maybe we can use that. Alternatively, use a1, but a1 is in c1's airport, so maybe not helpful here.

But p1 is in l2_5, which is in c2. So to get to l2_1, we can use truck t2, which is in l2_1. Wait, t2 is in l2_1, but p1 is in l2_5. So we need to drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_5. Wait, can trucks move within their city? Yes. So in city c2, t2 can drive to l2_5, load p1, then drive back to l2_1. Then load onto a2, fly to l1_1, unload. Then maybe use a truck in c1 to move it if needed, but l1_1 is the destination, so once unloaded there, it's done.

For p2, it's in l2_2, needs to be in l1_4 (c1). So similar process: move p2 to c1's airport (l1_1), then use a truck in c1 to take it to l1_4. Wait, but l1_4 is in c1. So steps would be: move p2 from l2_2 to l2_1 (using truck t2 in c2), load onto airplane (a2), fly to l1_1, unload, then use truck t1 (in c1, starts at l1_2) to drive to l1_1, load p2, drive to l1_4, unload.

But wait, the constraints complicate things. Let's check the constraints one by one.

Constraints:

1. At least one of p1 in l1_2 or p2 in l2_3 in at least one state.

2. p2 must be in l2_1 at some state.

3. If p2 is in l2_1, then earlier state where p2 in l2_3 or p1 in l1_3.

4. p2 in l1_4 (the goal).

5. If p2 is in l1_4, then earlier state where p1 in l1_3 or p2 in l2_4.

6. p2 must be in l1_1 at some state.

7. If p2 is in l1_1, then earlier p1 in l2_3.

8. p1 must be in l2_1 at some state.

9. If p1 is in l2_1 in state s, then either p2 in l2_4 or p1 in l2_2 must hold at s or after.

10. At least one of p1 or p2 in l1_3 in some state.

11. p2 must be in l2_2 in some state.

12. If p2 is in l2_2 in state s, then p2 in l2_3 or p1 in l2_3 must hold at s or after.

So, let's see. Let's start with p1's journey. To get p1 to l1_1, need to get it from l2_5 to l2_1 (c2's airport). So truck t2 can drive to l2_5, load p1, drive back to l2_1. Then load onto a2, fly to l1_1, unload. But wait, the initial state says "Package t1 is in location l1_2" and "Package t2 is in location l2_1". Wait, maybe that's a typo? Because t1 and t2 are trucks. So perhaps it's a mistake in the original state description. Let me check again.

Original state:

"Package t1 is in location l1_2"

Wait, that can't be. Because t1 is a truck. The correct statement should be "Truck t1 is in location l1_2". Similarly for others. Assuming that's a typo, and the actual initial positions are:

- Truck t1 is in l1_2 (c1)

- Truck t2 is in l2_1 (c2)

- Airplane a1 is in l1_1 (c1)

- Airplane a2 is in l2_1 (c2)

Packages p1 is in l2_5, p2 in l2_2.

So, for p1:

Move from l2_5 to l2_1 via truck t2. But t2 is in l2_1. So t2 needs to drive to l2_5, load p1, drive back to l2_1. Then load onto a2, fly to l1_1, unload. That's straightforward.

For p2: needs to go from l2_2 to l1_4. So, first move to l2_1 (airport of c2) via truck t2. Then load onto a2, fly to l1_1, unload. Then use truck t1 (in c1) to drive to l1_1, load p2, drive to l1_4, unload.

But let's check the constraints. Let's list each constraint and see how to satisfy them.

Constraint 2: p2 must be in l2_1 at some state. That's already part of the plan since we need to load p2 onto a2 at l2_1. So when we move p2 to l2_1, that's satisfied.

Constraint 3: If p2 is in l2_1, then earlier p2 was in l2_3 or p1 in l1_3. Wait, so before p2 is in l2_1, there must be a state where either p2 is in l2_3 or p1 is in l1_3. But in the initial state, p2 is in l2_2. To get to l2_1, we can just drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2, load p2, drive back. But then the path would be l2_1 → l2_2 → l2_1. So p2 is moved from l2_2 to l2_1. But how to satisfy constraint 3? Because when p2 is in l2_1 (after loading), we need to have had a prior state where p2 was in l2_3 or p1 in l1_3. But p1 starts in l2_5. So unless we move p1 to l1_3, which is in c1. That's a problem. So perhaps, before moving p2 to l2_1, we need to have p1 in l1_3 or p2 in l2_3. 

But how can that happen? Let's think. Let's say we first move p2 to l2_3. Then later move it to l2_1. Then constraint 3 would be satisfied. But how to get p2 to l2_3? Truck t2 is in l2_1. So drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2 (load p2), then drive to l2_3, unload p2 there. Then drive back to l2_3, load p2 again, and take to l2_1. But that's adding steps. Alternatively, maybe during the process of moving p1, we can have p1 pass through l1_3. But p1 is in c2, so to get to c1, maybe not. Wait, p1's path is l2_5 → l2_1 (via truck t2), then l2_1 → l1_1 (via airplane). So p1 never goes through l1_3. So to satisfy constraint 3, perhaps we need to have p2 go through l2_3 before reaching l2_1. Let's adjust the plan.

For p2: initial location is l2_2. To get to l2_1, perhaps take a detour through l2_3. So t2 drives from l2_1 to l2_2, load p2, drive to l2_3, unload p2 (satisfying constraint 3's condition), then load again, drive to l2_1. But then p2 is in l2_3 in that state, which satisfies the first part of constraint 3. Then when p2 is in l2_1, the prior state had p2 in l2_3. That works. So this would satisfy constraint 3.

Similarly, other constraints need to be checked. Let's outline a possible plan:

For p1:

1. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_5.

2. Load p1 into t2 at l2_5.

3. Drive t2 back to l2_1.

4. Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1.

5. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.

6. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1. (This achieves p1's goal.)

For p2:

But need to handle constraints. Let's process p2:

First, need to get p2 from l2_2 to l2_3 to satisfy constraint 3. Then to l2_1, then fly to l1_1, then truck to l1_4.

Wait, but how?

Possible steps for p2:

a. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2 (current location after moving p1? Wait, t2 is used for both p1 and p2. Need to sequence actions.

Wait, after handling p1, t2 would have driven to l2_5, loaded p1, driven back to l2_1. Then p1 is loaded onto a2. Then a2 flies to l1_1. Then, for p2, we need to move t2 again. Let's see:

Wait, the steps for p1 would be:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2

2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

3. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2

4. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

5. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

6. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

Now, for p2:

But after step 3, t2 is back at l2_1. To get p2 from l2_2, need to drive t2 to l2_2. But before that, maybe drive to l2_3? Wait, no. Let's see:

But constraint 3 says that when p2 is in l2_1 (which it needs to be to be loaded onto the airplane), there must be an earlier state where p2 was in l2_3 or p1 was in l1_3. So perhaps, after moving p1, we need to take p2 through l2_3.

Wait, but p1 is already in l1_1, which is c1's airport, so l1_3 is in c1. To get p1 to l1_3, we would need to unload it at l1_1, then load onto truck t1 (which is in l1_2) to drive to l1_3. But that's adding steps. Alternatively, maybe during p2's journey, we can route it through l2_3.

So for p2:

7. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2 (t2 is in l2_1 after step 3)

8. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

9. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2

10. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (now p2 is in l2_3, satisfying constraint 3's condition)

11. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3

12. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

13. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (but a2 is at l1_1 now, since step 5 was fly to l1_1. Wait, no: step 5 is fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1, so after step 5, a2 is at l1_1. So we can't load p2 onto a2 at l2_1 after that. Oops, that's a problem.

So the airplane a2 was used to fly p1 to l1_1, so it's now at l1_1. To transport p2 from c2 to c1, we need another airplane. But the only other airplane is a1, which is at l1_1. So unless a1 can fly to l2_1 to pick up p2. Let me check the airplanes available: a1 is in l1_1, a2 in l2_1 initially. Wait, initial state says "Package a1 is in location l1_1" and "Package a2 is in location l2_1". Wait, again, this is probably a typo. Airplanes are a1 and a2, so their initial positions are l1_1 and l2_1 respectively. So a1 is at l1_1 (c1's airport), a2 at l2_1 (c2's airport). So after step 5, a2 is at l1_1. So if we need to fly p2 from c2 to c1, we need to use a1 to go to c2. Let's see:

So maybe the plan for p1 uses a2 to fly to l1_1. Then for p2, we need to use a1. But a1 is in l1_1. So we can fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1, load p2, then fly back. But that requires a1 to make a round trip. Let's adjust the plan.

Alternative approach for p1:

Use a1 instead of a2. But a1 is in l1_1. So to use a1 to carry p1 from c2 to c1, we need to fly a1 to l2_1, load p1, then fly back. But that's possible.

Wait, but p1 is in l2_5. So steps:

For p1:

1. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_5 (c2).

2. Load p1 into t2 at l2_5.

3. Drive t2 back to l2_1.

4. Now, to load p1 onto a1, which is in l1_1. So a1 needs to be flown to l2_1. But can't fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1 (since they are in different cities). Wait, no: airports are in cities. l1_1 is in c1, l2_1 in c2. The flyairplane action allows flying between any two airports. So yes, a1 can fly from l1_1 to l2_1.

So steps for a1:

5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

6. loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

7. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1

8. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

But this way, p1 is delivered to l1_1 using a1. Then a1 is back at l1_1. Then, for p2, we can use a2. Let's see:

a2 starts at l2_1. So after loading p2 into a2 at l2_1, fly to l1_1. Then unload, then truck to l1_4.

But this approach would leave a2 at l1_1. But maybe that's okay.

But this approach requires more steps for p1. Let's compare the two options. Original plan using a2 to fly p1 would have a2 end up at l1_1. Then for p2, using a1 to fly to l2_1 and back. But that would take more steps. Alternatively, maybe use a2 for p1 and then a2 can't be used for p2. Hmm.

But perhaps we need to manage the airplanes properly.

Alternatively, maybe using a2 for p1, then a2 is at l1_1. Then for p2, use a1 to fly to l2_1, load p2, fly back. Let's try this.

So p1's steps:

1. Drive t2 to l2_5, load p1, drive back to l2_1.

2. Load p1 into a2 at l2_1.

3. Fly a2 to l1_1, unload p1. Now a2 is at l1_1.

For p2:

4. Drive t2 to l2_2, load p2.

But need to handle constraint 3, which requires that when p2 is in l2_1 (which is when it's loaded onto the airplane), there was a prior state where p2 was in l2_3 or p1 in l1_3. So, after moving p2 to l2_1, need to ensure that earlier it was in l2_3 or p1 was in l1_3.

But p1 is in l1_1, which is c1. To get p1 to l1_3, need to use truck t1. So after step 3 (p1 at l1_1), we can drive t1 to l1_1, load p1, drive to l1_3, unload. Then that would satisfy the condition. But this adds steps.

Alternatively, move p2 through l2_3 before getting to l2_1.

So for p2:

4. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2, load p2.

5. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_3, unload p2. (Now p2 is in l2_3, which satisfies the condition for constraint 3 when later p2 is in l2_1.)

6. Load p2 into t2 at l2_3.

7. Drive t2 to l2_1, unload p2. (Now p2 is in l2_1, and the prior state had p2 in l2_3, satisfying constraint 3.)

8. Load p2 onto a1 (which is at l1_1? No, a1 is at l1_1. To load p2 onto an airplane at l2_1, we need an airplane there. After step 3, a2 is at l1_1. So we need to use a1 again. So fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.

Wait, let's outline:

For p2:

After p1 is delivered, to move p2:

4. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (so a1 is now at l2_1)

5. drive t2 to l2_2, load p2.

6. drive t2 to l2_3, unload p2. (Now p2 is in l2_3)

7. load p2 into t2 again, drive to l2_1.

8. load p2 onto a1 at l2_1.

9. fly a1 l2_1 l1_1.

10. unload p2 from a1 at l1_1.

11. Now, drive truck t1 (in c1, starts at l1_2) to l1_1, load p2, drive to l1_4, unload.

But this requires multiple steps and using a1 again.

But this approach seems complex. Let's check if this satisfies all constraints.

Let's track the constraints:

Constraint 1: At least one of p1 in l1_2 or p2 in l2_3. In step 6, p2 is in l2_3. So that's satisfied.

Constraint 2: p2 in l2_1. Step 7: when t2 is at l2_1 and p2 is loaded into t2, then after driving to l2_1, p2 is unloaded there? Wait, no. Wait, steps:

After step 5: t2 is at l2_2, loaded p2.

Step 6: drive t2 to l2_3, unload p2. So p2 is in l2_3.

Step 7: load p2 into t2 at l2_3.

Step 8: drive t2 to l2_1, unload p2. So p2 is now in l2_1. That satisfies constraint 2.

Constraint 3: When p2 is in l2_1 (step 8), there's a prior state (step 6) where p2 was in l2_3. So satisfied.

Constraint 4: p2 in l1_4 (goal) achieved at the end.

Constraint 5: If p2 is in l1_4, then earlier p1 in l1_3 or p2 in l2_4. So after p2 is in l1_4, we need to ensure that in some prior state, p1 was in l1_3 or p2 was in l2_4. Let's see: in the current plan, p1 is in l1_1 (step 3). To get p1 to l1_3, need to use truck t1. So perhaps after step 3, we have steps:

12. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 (since t1 is initially at l1_2).

13. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1.

14. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1.

15. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3. (Now p1 is in l1_3, which satisfies part of constraint 5.)

Then, later steps to move p1 back to l1_1.

But that's adding steps. Alternatively, during p2's journey, route it through l2_4. Let's see.

For constraint 5: after p2 is in l1_4 (final step), there must be a prior state where p1 is in l1_3 or p2 is in l2_4. So maybe during p2's journey, after being in l2_3, drive to l2_4 before going to l2_1. Let's adjust steps:

After step 6: p2 is in l2_3.

Step 7: load p2 into t2, drive to l2_4, unload. (Now p2 is in l2_4.)

Step 8: load p2 into t2 again, drive to l2_1, unload.

Now, when p2 is in l1_4, the prior state where p2 was in l2_4 satisfies constraint 5.

So this adds steps but helps with constraint 5.

Alternatively, if we can have p2 pass through l2_4, that would help. Let's adjust p2's steps:

After delivering p1, for p2:

4. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (so a1 is now in l2_1).

5. drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2.

6. load p2 into t2.

7. drive t2 to l2_3, unload p2. (p2 in l2_3, satisfies constraint 1 and 3.)

8. load p2 into t2 again.

9. drive t2 to l2_4, unload p2. (p2 in l2_4, satisfies constraint 5.)

10. load p2 into t2 again.

11. drive t2 to l2_1, unload p2. (p2 in l2_1, satisfies constraint 2 and 3.)

12. load p2 onto a1 at l2_1.

13. fly a1 to l1_1.

14. unload p2 from a1 at l1_1.

15. drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1.

16. load p2 into t1.

17. drive t1 to l1_4.

18. unload p2.

Now, during this process, constraint 5 is satisfied because p2 was in l2_4 (step 9). 

But let's check other constraints:

Constraint 6: p2 must be in l1_1. In step 14, p2 is unloaded at l1_1. So that's satisfied.

Constraint 7: If p2 is in l1_1, then earlier p1 in l2_3. Wait, p1 was delivered to l1_1 via a2 (assuming initial plan). So p1 is in l1_1. But in this adjusted plan, p1's journey is via a2. So p1 was in l2_5 → l2_1 (via t2), loaded onto a2, flown to l1_1. So p1 was never in l2_3. But constraint 7 says if p2 is in l1_1 (step 14), then there must be an earlier state where p1 is in l2_3. But p1's path never goes through l2_3. So this is a problem. So this approach fails to satisfy constraint 7.

Hmm. So how to handle constraint 7. The constraint is: if p2 is in l1_1, then there must be an earlier state where p1 is in l2_3.

But p1's journey is from l2_5 to l2_1 (via t2), then to l1_1. So unless we have p1 pass through l2_3, which is in c2. But l2_3 is a location in c2. To get p1 to l2_3, we'd need to drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_3. But in the initial steps, we drove t2 to l2_5, loaded p1, drove back to l2_1. So if instead, after loading p1, we drive t2 to l2_3, unload p1 there, then drive to l2_1. But that would mean p1 is in l2_3, satisfying the condition for constraint 7. Let's try:

Revised steps for p1:

1. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_5.

2. Load p1 into t2.

3. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_3.

4. Unload p1 at l2_3. (Now p1 is in l2_3.)

5. Load p1 into t2 again.

6. Drive t2 to l2_1.

7. Load p1 onto a2.

8. Fly a2 to l1_1.

9. Unload p1.

Now, when p2 is in l1_1 (step 14 in previous plan), the prior state where p1 was in l2_3 (step 4) satisfies constraint 7.

But this adds steps to p1's journey. However, this would complicate the plan. But it's necessary to satisfy constraint 7.

But then, after step 4, p1 is in l2_3. But then step 5 loads it back into t2, and moves to l2_1. So when p1 is loaded into a2 and flown to l1_1, the earlier state where p1 was in l2_3 exists, which satisfies constraint 7.

So this seems necessary.

Let's outline the full plan with all constraints considered:

For p1:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2

2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

3. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_3 c2

4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (p1 is here, satisfying constraint 7)

5. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

6. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

7. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

8. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

9. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (p1 done)

For p2:

Now, need to move p2 from l2_2 to l1_4, while meeting all constraints.

Constraints for p2:

- Must be in l2_1 (step 11 below)

- Must be in l1_4 (final step)

- When in l2_1, prior state with p2 in l2_3 or p1 in l1_3 (we have p1 in l2_3 from step 4)

- When in l1_4, prior state with p1 in l1_3 or p2 in l2_4 (we can route p2 through l2_4)

- Must be in l2_2 (initial state, which satisfies constraint 11)

- When in l2_2, then after, p2 in l2_3 or p1 in l2_3. But p1 was in l2_3 at step 4, which is before p2 is in l2_2 (since p2 starts in l2_2). Wait, p2 is initially in l2_2. So constraint 12 says if p2 is in l2_2 (which is initially true), then after that, p2 must be in l2_3 or p1 in l2_3. But p1 is moved to l2_3 in step 4. So if during the plan, after the initial state, p2 is in l2_2 again, then constraint 12 applies. But since the initial state has p2 in l2_2, we need to ensure that after that, either p2 moves to l2_3 or p1 is in l2_3. But p1 is moved to l2_3 in step 4, which occurs after the initial state. So that satisfies constraint 12. Because in the initial state, p2 is in l2_2. Then, step 4 has p1 in l2_3, which happens after, so constraint 12 is satisfied.

Now, for p2's steps:

10. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2 (t2 is at l2_1 after step 6)

11. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (now p2 is in t2, so l2_2 is no longer its location. But initially, p2 is in l2_2. So in the initial state, p2 is in l2_2. When we load it into t2, it's no longer there. So the state after step 11 has p2 in t2. But constraint 11 requires p2 to be in l2_2 in some state. The initial state satisfies that. So constraint 11 is already met.

But after step 11, p2 is loaded into t2. Then:

12. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2

13. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (satisfies constraint 1 and 3)

14. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3

15. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2 (to satisfy constraint 5)

16. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (now p2 is in l2_4, which will later satisfy constraint 5)

17. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

18. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2

19. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (but a2 is at l1_1 after step 8). So we need to use a different airplane. Wait, a1 is at l1_1. So we need to fly a1 to l2_1.

But after step 9, a2 is at l1_1. So to load p2 onto an airplane in l2_1, need to have an airplane there. So steps:

20. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (now a1 is at l2_1)

21. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

22. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1

23. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (now p2 is in l1_1, satisfying constraint 6)

24. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 (t1 starts at l1_2)

25. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

26. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

27. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (p2 done)

Now, check all constraints:

Constraint 1: p2 in l2_3 (step 13) or p1 in l1_2 (initial state of p1 in l2_5, so no). So step 13 satisfies it.

Constraint 2: p2 in l2_1 during step 19.

Constraint 3: When p2 is in l2_1 (step 19), prior state has p2 in l2_4 (step 16).

Wait, no: in this plan, p2 is moved from l2_4 to l2_1 (steps 18-19). So prior state is step 16 where p2 is in l2_4. But constraint 3 says that if p2 is in l2_1, there must be a prior state where p2 was in l2_3 or p1 in l1_3. But p1 was in l2_3 (step 4). So step 4 is prior to step 19. So even though p2 was in l2_4, the presence of p1 in l2_3 earlier satisfies constraint 3. Because the condition is "at least one of p2 in l2_3 or p1 in l1_3". Here, p1 was in l2_3, which is in c2. Wait, l1_3 is in c1. So p1 in l2_3 (c2) doesn't satisfy the p1 in l1_3 (c1) part. So this is a problem.

Ah, here's a mistake. Constraint 3 states:

"If p2 is in l2_1, then there must be an earlier state where p2 is in l2_3 or p1 is in l1_3."

But in our plan, p1 was in l2_3 (c2's location), not l1_3 (c1's location). So that doesn't satisfy the condition. So this is a problem.

So to satisfy constraint 3, when p2 is in l2_1 (step 19), there must be a prior state where p2 was in l2_3 or p1 was in l1_3.

In our current plan, p1 was in l2_3 (step 4), but l2_3 is in c2. The constraint requires p1 in l1_3 (c1). So this does not satisfy the condition. Therefore, we need to have either p2 in l2_3 or p1 in l1_3 before p2 is in l2_1.

So we need to adjust the plan to have p1 in l1_3 or p2 in l2_3.

But p1's journey is to l1_1. So to get p1 to l1_3, we need to move it from l1_1 to l1_3 using truck t1.

So after step 9 (p1 in l1_1), add steps:

10. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1

11. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

12. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1

13. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (now p1 is in l1_3)

Then, later steps for p2 can rely on this.

But this adds more steps and time. Let's see.

But this would satisfy constraint 3 when p2 is in l2_1. Because prior to that, p1 was in l1_3.

But when does p2 get to l2_1? In step 19, which is after these new steps. So yes, this would satisfy constraint 3.

But this complicates the plan. Let's adjust the plan accordingly.

Revised plan steps (numbers adjusted):

For p1:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2

2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

3. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2

4. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

5. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

6. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

7. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1

8. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

9. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1

10. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (now p1 is in l1_3, satisfying constraint 3 when p2 later is in l2_1)

11. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3

12. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1

13. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (p1 is back at l1_1)

Now, p1's journey is done. Now for p2:

14. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2

15. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

16. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2

17. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (satisfies constraint 1)

18. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3

19. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2

20. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (satisfies constraint 5)

21. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

22. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2

23. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (a1 is at l1_1, so need to fly it to l2_1)

24. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

25. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

26. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1

27. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (satisfies constraint 6)

28. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1 (t1 is at l1_1 after step 13)

29. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

30. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

31. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

But this is getting very lengthy. Let's check the constraints again:

Constraint 3: p2 in l2_1 at step 23. Prior state must have p2 in l2_3 or p1 in l1_3. p1 was in l1_3 at step 10. Yes.

Constraint 5: p2 in l1_4 (step 31). Prior state has p2 in l2_4 (step 20). Yes.

Constraint 7: p2 in l1_1 (step 27). Prior state must have p1 in l2_3. But p1 was in l1_3 (step 10), not l2_3. So this is a problem. Because constraint 7 says if p2 is in l1_1, then there must be a prior state where p1 is in l2_3. But in this plan, p1 was in l1_3. So this doesn't satisfy constraint 7.

Ah, this is a major issue. So to satisfy constraint 7, when p2 is in l1_1 (step 27), there must be a prior state where p1 is in l2_3. But in the current plan, p1 was in l1_3. So this is not satisfied. So we need to adjust.

This suggests that p1 must pass through l2_3. But p1 is in c2 initially, moved to l2_5, then to l2_1, then to l1_1. So unless we route p1 through l2_3 during its journey.

Alternative approach: after step 3 (p1 in t2 at l2_1), drive t2 to l2_3, unload p1 there, then load back into t2 and drive to l2_1. This would make p1 be in l2_3.

So revised steps for p1:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2

2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

3. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_3 c2

4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (now p1 is in l2_3)

5. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

6. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

7. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

8. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

9. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

Now, when p2 is in l1_1 (step 27), there is a prior state (step 4) where p1 was in l2_3, satisfying constraint 7.

So with this adjustment, the plan now satisfies constraint 7.

Now, let's integrate this into the full plan:

For p1:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2

2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

3. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_3 c2

4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (p1 in l2_3)

5. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

6. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

7. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

8. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

9. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

For p2:

10. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2

11. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

12. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2

13. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (satisfies constraint 1 and 3)

14. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3

15. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2

16. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (satisfies constraint 5)

17. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

18. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2

19. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (assuming a1 is flown to l2_1)

20. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

21. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

22. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1

23. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (satisfies constraint 6)

24. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1

25. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

26. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

27. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (goal)

Now, check all constraints:

Constraint 1: p2 in l2_3 (step 13) or p1 in l1_2 (no). Satisfied by step 13.

Constraint 2: p2 in l2_1 (step 18). Yes.

Constraint 3: p2 in l2_1 (step 18) and prior state p2 in l2_3 (step 13). Yes.

Constraint 4: p2 in l1_4. Yes (step 27).

Constraint 5: p2 in l1_4, prior state p2 in l2_4 (step 16). Yes.

Constraint 6: p2 in l1_1 (step 23). Yes.

Constraint 7: p2 in l1_1 (step 23), prior state p1 in l2_3 (step 4). Yes.

Constraint 8: p1 in l2_1. Yes (step 7, when loaded into a2).

Constraint 9: If p1 is in l2_1 (during step 7), then after that, p2 in l2_4 or p1 in l2_2. After step 7, p1 is loaded into a2 and flown to l1_1. So during or after step 7, p2 is in l2_4 (step 16) which occurs after. So satisfied.

Constraint 10: At least one of p1 or p2 in l1_3. In this plan, p1 is never in l1_3. p2 is never in l1_3. So this constraint is not satisfied. Oops, this is a problem.

Constraint 10: At least one of p1 or p2 in l1_3. So during the plan, we need to have either p1 or p2 in l1_3 (which is in c1).

In the current plan, p1 is in l1_1 and l2_3 (c2), p2 is in l1_1 and l1_4. So neither is in l1_3. So we need to add steps to get either p1 or p2 to l1_3.

One way is to route p2 through l1_3 after arriving in c1.

So after step 23 (p2 in l1_1):

24. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 (t1 starts at l1_2)

25. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

26. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1

27. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (now p2 is in l1_3, satisfying constraint 10)

28. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

29. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1

30. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

This adds steps but ensures that p2 is in l1_3.

Alternatively, after delivering p1 to l1_1, move p1 to l1_3 and back.

For example:

After step 9 (p1 in l1_1):

10. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1

11. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

12. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1

13. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (now p1 is in l1_3, satisfying constraint 10)

14. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3

15. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1

16. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

Then proceed with p2's steps.

This would satisfy constraint 10.

But this adds steps. Let's adjust the plan accordingly.

Revised steps after p1 is delivered:

For p1:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2

2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

3. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_3 c2

4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

5. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

6. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

7. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

8. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

9. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

Now, to satisfy constraint 10:

10. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1

11. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

12. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1

13. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (now p1 in l1_3)

14. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3

15. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1

16. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

Now, for p2:

17. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2

18. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

19. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2

20. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3

21. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3

22. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2

23. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

24. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

25. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2

26. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (need to fly a1 to l2_1)

27. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

28. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

29. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1

30. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

31. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

32. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

33. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

34. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

Now, check constraint 10: p1 is in l1_3 at step 13. So satisfied.

All other constraints should now be met.

This plan is quite long, but it's necessary to meet all the constraints. Now, the final step is to ensure that the plan is optimal, meaning there's no shorter valid plan. Given the numerous constraints, it's likely that this is the minimal steps required.
