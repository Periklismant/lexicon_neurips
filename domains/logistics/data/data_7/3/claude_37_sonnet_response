Alright, let me break down this problem.

1. The domain involves cities, locations, trucks, airplanes, and packages.
2. Trucks can move within a city, while airplanes can move between airports.
3. The goal is to ensure that package p1 is in location l1_1 and package p2 is in location l1_4.

First, let's clarify the initial state of the world:

- Locations l1_1, l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5 are in city c1.
- Locations l2_1, l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5 are in city c2.
- l1_1 and l2_1 are airports.
- Package t1 is in location l1_2. (This seems wrong; t1 is a truck.)
- Package t2 is in location l2_1. (This seems wrong; t2 is a truck.)
- Package p1 is in location l2_5.
- Package p2 is in location l2_2.
- Package a1 is in location l1_1. (This seems wrong; a1 is an airplane.)
- Package a2 is in location l2_1. (This seems wrong; a2 is an airplane.)

Given that trucks and airplanes are not packages, I'm assuming the initial state should be:

- Truck t1 is in location l1_2.
- Truck t2 is in location l2_1.
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (which is an airport).
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1 (which is an airport).
- Package p1 is in location l2_5.
- Package p2 is in location l2_2.

Now, let's look at the constraints:

1. At some point, p1 is in l1_2 OR p2 is in l2_3.
2. At some point, p2 is in l2_1.
3. Before p2 is in l2_1, p2 is in l2_3 OR p1 is in l1_3.
4. At some point, p2 is in l1_4.
5. Before p2 is in l1_4, p1 is in l1_3 OR p2 is in l2_4.
6. At some point, p2 is in l1_1.
7. Before p2 is in l1_1, p1 is in l2_3.
8. At some point, p1 is in l2_1.
9. At or after p1 is in l2_1, p2 is in l2_4 OR p1 is in l2_2.
10. At some point, p1 is in l1_3 OR p2 is in l1_3.
11. At some point, p2 is in l2_2.
12. At or after p2 is in l2_2, p2 is in l2_3 OR p1 is in l2_3.

I note that according to the initial state, p2 is already in l2_2. This satisfies constraint 11, but now I need to make sure that constraint 12 is met (after or at the state where p2 is in l2_2, p2 is in l2_3 OR p1 is in l2_3).

Let's start mapping out a plan. First, let's see what actions we can take from the initial state.

We need to get p1 from l2_5 to l1_1, and p2 from l2_2 to l1_4.

Given the constraints, we have to follow a specific sequence of locations for each package. Let's try to come up with a plan.

I need to trace the dependencies:
- Constraint 12: Since p2 is initially in l2_2, I need to ensure that either p2 moves to l2_3 or p1 moves to l2_3 as the next step.
- Constraint 7: p1 must be in l2_3 before p2 can be in l1_1.
- Constraint 3: Either p2 must be in l2_3 or p1 must be in l1_3 before p2 can be in l2_1.
- Constraint 5: Either p1 must be in l1_3 or p2 must be in l2_4 before p2 can be in l1_4.

Let me list the constraints again, but now I'll note which are satisfied by the initial state and which need to be met:

1. At some point, p1 is in l1_2 OR p2 is in l2_3. (This is not met in the initial state.)
2. At some point, p2 is in l2_1. (This is not met in the initial state.)
3. Before p2 is in l2_1, p2 is in l2_3 OR p1 is in l1_3. (This will be relevant when we move p2 to l2_1. Since I have to move p2 there, I need to satisfy this condition first.)
4. At some point, p2 is in l1_4. (This is not met in the initial state but is part of the goal.)
5. Before p2 is in l1_4, p1 is in l1_3 OR p2 is in l2_4. (This will be relevant when we move p2 to l1_4. Since I have to move p2 there for the goal, I need to satisfy this condition first.)
6. At some point, p2 is in l1_1. (This is not met in the initial state.)
7. Before p2 is in l1_1, p1 is in l2_3. (This will be relevant when we move p2 to l1_1. Since I have to move p2 there, I need to ensure p1 is in l2_3 before that.)
8. At some point, p1 is in l2_1. (This is not met in the initial state.)
9. At or after p1 is in l2_1, p2 is in l2_4 OR p1 is in l2_2. (This will be relevant when we move p1 to l2_1. We'll need to satisfy this condition afterward.)
10. At some point, p1 is in l1_3 OR p2 is in l1_3. (This is not met in the initial state.)
11. At some point, p2 is in l2_2. (This is met in the initial state.)
12. At or after p2 is in l2_2, p2 is in l2_3 OR p1 is in l2_3. (This will be relevant right from the start since p2 is in l2_2. I need to ensure that either p2 or p1 is in l2_3 as the next step.)

Let's try to come up with a sequence of actions that satisfies all constraints and achieves the goal.

Here's a potential plan:

1. First, we need to address constraint 12: Since p2 is in l2_2, either p2 or p1 must go to l2_3. Let's move p2 to l2_3.
   - Use t2 to move p2 from l2_2 to l2_3.

2. This also addresses constraint 1.

3. Now, we need to address constraint 7: p1 must be in l2_3 before p2 can be in l1_1. Let's move p1 from l2_5 to l2_3.
   - Use t2 to move p1 from l2_5 to l2_3.

4. For constraint 3, we need p2 to be in l2_3 OR p1 to be in l1_3 before p2 can be in l2_1. We've already moved p2 to l2_3, so this is satisfied.

5. Now, we can move p2 to l2_1 for constraint 2.
   - Use t2 to move p2 from l2_3 to l2_1.

6. For constraint 8, we need p1 to be in l2_1 at some point. Let's move p1 from l2_3 to l2_1.
   - Use t2 to move p1 from l2_3 to l2_1.

7. After p1 is in l2_1, for constraint 9, either p2 must be in l2_4 or p1 must be in l2_2. Let's move p1 to l2_2.
   - Use t2 to move p1 from l2_1 to l2_2.

8. For constraint 10, either p1 or p2 must be in l1_3 at some point. We need to transport them from city c2 to city c1. We can use an airplane for this. Let's get both packages to l2_1 (which is an airport).
   - Use t2 to move p1 from l2_2 to l2_1.
   - We won't move p2 as it's already in l2_1.

9. Now, we can use a1 to transport both packages to l1_1 (the airport in c1).
   - Use a2 to fly from l2_1 to l1_1.
   - Use a2 to transport p2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
   - Use a2 to transport p1 from l2_1 to l1_1.

10. For constraint 10, we need to move either p1 or p2 to l1_3. Let's move p1 to l1_3.
    - Use t1 to move p1 from l1_1 to l1_3.

11. For constraint 5, we need p1 to be in l1_3 OR p2 to be in l2_4 before p2 can be in l1_4. Since p1 is in l1_3, this is satisfied.

12. Now, we can move p2 to l1_4 for constraint 4 and the goal.
    - Use t1 to move p2 from l1_1 to l1_4.

13. Finally, we need to move p1 back to l1_1 for the goal.
    - Use t1 to move p1 from l1_3 to l1_1.

Let me check if this plan satisfies all constraints. If not, I'll revise it.

Wait, there's an issue. I've been just stating high-level operations like "use t2 to move p1 from l2_5 to l2_3," but in reality, I need to break this down into specific actions like loadtruck, drivetruck, and unloadtruck.

Let me be more precise by sketching the entire plan with detailed actions.

Let's start from the initial state:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_2.
- Truck t2 is in location l2_1.
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (airport).
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1 (airport).
- Package p1 is in location l2_5.
- Package p2 is in location l2_2.

1. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2 (Move truck t2 to location l2_2)
2. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (Load package p2 into truck t2)
3. Drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2 (Move truck t2 to location l2_3)
4. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (Unload package p2 at location l2_3)
5. Drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2 (Move truck t2 to location l2_5)
6. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (Load package p1 into truck t2)
7. Drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_3 c2 (Move truck t2 to location l2_3)
8. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (Unload package p1 at location l2_3)
9. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (Load package p2 into truck t2)
10. Drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2 (Move truck t2 to location l2_1)
11. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (Unload package p2 at location l2_1)
12. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2 (Move truck t2 to location l2_3)
13. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (Load package p1 into truck t2)
14. Drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2 (Move truck t2 to location l2_1)
15. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (Unload package p1 at location l2_1)
16. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2 (Move truck t2 to location l2_2)
17. Loadtruck p1 a2 l2_1 (Load package p1 into airplane a2)
18. Loadtruck p2 a2 l2_1 (Load package p2 into airplane a2)
19. Flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (Fly airplane a2 from location l2_1 to location l1_1)
20. Unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (Unload package p1 at location l1_1)
21. Unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (Unload package p2 at location l1_1)
22. Drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 (Move truck t1 to location l1_1)
23. Loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (Load package p1 into truck t1)
24. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1 (Move truck t1 to location l1_3)
25. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (Unload package p1 at location l1_3)
26. Drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1 (Move truck t1 to location l1_1)
27. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (Load package p2 into truck t1)
28. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1 (Move truck t1 to location l1_4)
29. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (Unload package p2 at location l1_4)
30. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1 (Move truck t1 to location l1_3)
31. Loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (Load package p1 into truck t1)
32. Drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1 (Move truck t1 to location l1_1)
33. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (Unload package p1 at location l1_1)

But wait, I see two errors. Let me fix:

17. Loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (Load package p1 into airplane a2)
18. Loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (Load package p2 into airplane a2)

Ok actually, Loadtruck p1 a2 l2_1 seems doubly wrong. Let me reconsider.

We have at this point:
- Truck t2 is in location l2_2
- Package p1 is in location l2_1
- Package p2 is in location l2_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

16. Loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (Load package p1 into airplane a2)
17. Loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (Load package p2 into airplane a2)

Hmm, I'm also not sure if we need to drive t2 to l2_2 in step 16. Let me trace it with more care.

Action 15 results in Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1. 
16. Loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1.
17. Loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1.

But that's fine; I need to check if we have satisfied constraint 9. After p1 is in l2_1, we need p2 in l2_4 OR p1 in l2_2. We haven't done either yet. So, one option is to move p1 to l2_2:

16. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
17. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (Load p1 into t2 at l2_1)
18. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
19. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

But this doesn't work either, because we're trying to load p1 from l2_1 into t2, but t2 is not at l2_1. It's confusing.

Let me trace our plan more carefully to ensure we're meeting all constraints.

Initial state:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_2.
- Truck t2 is in location l2_1.
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (airport).
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1 (airport).
- Package p1 is in location l2_5.
- Package p2 is in location l2_2.

1. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2 (Move truck t2 to location l2_2)
2. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (Load package p2 into truck t2)
3. Drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2 (Move truck t2 to location l2_3)
4. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (Unload package p2 at location l2_3. This satisfies constraint 1 and prepares for constraint 3.)

At this point:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_2.
- Truck t2 is in location l2_3.
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (airport).
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1 (airport).
- Package p1 is in location l2_5.
- Package p2 is in location l2_3.

5. Drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2 (Move truck t2 to location l2_5)
6. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (Load package p1 into truck t2)
7. Drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_3 c2 (Move truck t2 to location l2_3)
8. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (Unload package p1 at location l2_3. This satisfies constraint 12 and prepares for constraint 7.)

At this point:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_2.
- Truck t2 is in location l2_3.
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (airport).
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1 (airport).
- Package p1 is in location l2_3.
- Package p2 is in location l2_3.

9. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (Load package p2 into truck t2)
10. Drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2 (Move truck t2 to location l2_1)
11. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (Unload package p2 at location l2_1. This satisfies constraint 2, given that constraint 3 was prepared.)

At this point:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_2.
- Truck t2 is in location l2_1.
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (airport).
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1 (airport).
- Package p1 is in location l2_3.
- Package p2 is in location l2_1.

12. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2 (Move truck t2 to location l2_3)
13. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (Load package p1 into truck t2)
14. Drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2 (Move truck t2 to location l2_1)
15. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (Unload package p1 at location l2_1. This satisfies constraint 8.)

At this point:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_2.
- Truck t2 is in location l2_1.
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (airport).
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1 (airport).
- Package p1 is in location l2_1.
- Package p2 is in location l2_1.

Now, we need to address constraint 9: After p1 is in l2_1, we need to ensure either p2 is in l2_4 or p1 is in l2_2. Let's move p1 to l2_2:

16. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (Load package p1 into truck t2)
17. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2 (Move truck t2 to location l2_2)
18. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (Unload package p1 at location l2_2. This satisfies constraint 9.)

At this point:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_2.
- Truck t2 is in location l2_2.
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (airport).
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1 (airport).
- Package p1 is in location l2_2.
- Package p2 is in location l2_1.

Now, we can prepare for the transport of packages to city c1:

19. Drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 (Move truck t2 to location l2_1)
20. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (Load package p1 into truck t2)
21. Drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 (Move truck t2 to location l2_1)
22. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (Unload package p1 at location l2_1)

I'm getting confused here. Let me trace the steps more carefully.

After step 18:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_2.
- Truck t2 is in location l2_2.
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (airport).
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1 (airport).
- Package p1 is in location l2_2.
- Package p2 is in location l2_1.

19. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (Load package p1 into truck t2)
20. Drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 (Move truck t2 to location l2_1)
21. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (Unload package p1 at location l2_1)

At this point:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_2.
- Truck t2 is in location l2_1.
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (airport).
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1 (airport).
- Package p1 is in location l2_1.
- Package p2 is in location l2_1.

Now, we can transport packages using the airplane:

22. Loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (Load package p1 into airplane a2)
23. Loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (Load package p2 into airplane a2)
24. Flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (Fly airplane a2 from location l2_1 to location l1_1)
25. Unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (Unload package p1 at location l1_1)
26. Unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (Unload package p2 at location l1_1. This satisfies constraint 6, given that constraint 7 was satisfied.)

At this point:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_2.
- Truck t2 is in location l2_1.
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (airport).
- Airplane a2 is in location l1_1 (airport).
- Package p1 is in location l1_1 (which is one of our goal conditions).
- Package p2 is in location l1_1.

We still need to satisfy constraint 10 (either p1 or p2 in l1_3) and the goal for p2 to be in l1_4. Let's take p2 for a ride:

27. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
28. Drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1

Oh, I made an error. We need to first move t1 to l1_1 before we can load p2:

27. Drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 (Move truck t1 to location l1_1)
28. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (Load package p2 into truck t1)
29. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1 (Move truck t1 to location l1_3)
30. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (Unload package p2 at location l1_3. This satisfies constraint 10.)

At this point:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_3.
- Truck t2 is in location l2_1.
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (airport).
- Airplane a2 is in location l1_1 (airport).
- Package p1 is in location l1_1 (which is one of our goal conditions).
- Package p2 is in location l1_3.

Now, we need to move p2 to l1_4. According to constraint 5, before p2 is in l1_4, we need p1 to be in l1_3 OR p2 to be in l2_4. Since p2 is currently in l1_3 and not in l2_4, we might need to move p1 to l1_3 first.

Actually, I think I misunderstood. The constraint says "Before p2 is in l1_4, p1 is in l1_3 OR p2 is in l2_4." Currently, neither condition is true. So, I need to ensure one of these conditions is met before moving p2 to l1_4.

Ok, this means I need to move p1 from l1_1 to l1_3 before I can move p2 to l1_4. That means we need to swap their positions (p1 and p2) in the city c1:

31. Loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (Load package p1 into truck t1)
32. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1 (Move truck t1 to location l1_3)
33. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (Unload package p1 at location l1_3. This satisfies the condition for constraint 5.)

But I notice I made another error. I already have t1 in l1_3, not in l1_1. So I need to recompute this again.

At this point:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_3.
- Truck t2 is in location l2_1.
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (airport).
- Airplane a2 is in location l1_1 (airport).
- Package p1 is in location l1_1 (which is one of our goal conditions).
- Package p2 is in location l1_3.

31. Drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1 (Move truck t1 to location l1_1)
32. Loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (Load package p1 into truck t1)
33. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1 (Move truck t1 to location l1_3)
34. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (Unload package p1 at location l1_3. This satisfies the condition for constraint 5.)

At this point:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_3.
- Truck t2 is in location l2_1.
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (airport).
- Airplane a2 is in location l1_1 (airport).
- Package p1 is in location l1_3.
- Package p2 is in location l1_3.

Now, we can move p2 to l1_4 for the goal and to satisfy constraint 4:

35. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (Load package p2 into truck t1)
36. Drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1 (Move truck t1 to location l1_4)
37. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (Unload package p2 at location l1_4. This satisfies constraint 4 and the goal.)

At this point:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_4.
- Truck t2 is in location l2_1.
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (airport).
- Airplane a2 is in location l1_1 (airport).
- Package p1 is in location l1_3.
- Package p2 is in location l1_4.

We're almost there! We just need to get p1 back to l1_1 for the goal:

38. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1 (Move truck t1 to location l1_3)
39. Loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (Load package p1 into truck t1)
40. Drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1 (Move truck t1 to location l1_1)
41. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (Unload package p1 at location l1_1. This satisfies the goal.)

At this point:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_1.
- Truck t2 is in location l2_1.
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (airport).
- Airplane a2 is in location l1_1 (airport).
- Package p1 is in location l1_1.
- Package p2 is in location l1_4.

And we have achieved the goal: p1 is in l1_1 and p2 is in l1_4.

Let me now check which constraints we have satisfied:

1. At some point, p1 is in l1_2 OR p2 is in l2_3: p2 was in l2_3 after step 4.
2. At some point, p2 is in l2_1: p2 was in l2_1 after step 11.
3. Before p2 is in l2_1, p2 is in l2_3 OR p1 is in l1_3: p2 was in l2_3 before it was in l2_1.
4. At some point, p2 is in l1_4: p2 was in l1_4 after step 37.
5. Before p2 is in l1_4, p1 is in l1_3 OR p2 is in l2_4: p1 was in l1_3 before p2 was in l1_4.
6. At some point, p2 is in l1_1: p2 was in l1_1 after step 26.
7. Before p2 is in l1_1, p1 is in l2_3: p1 was in l2_3 after step 8, which is before p2 was in l1_1.
8. At some point, p1 is in l2_1: p1 was in l2_1 after step 15.
9. At or after p1 is in l2_1, p2 is in l2_4 OR p1 is in l2_2: p1 was in l2_2 after step 18, which is after p1 was in l2_1.
10. At some point, p1 is in l1_3 OR p2 is in l1_3: p1 was in l1_3 after step 34 and p2 was in l1_3 after step 30.
11. At some point, p2 is in l2_2: p2 was in l2_2 in the initial state.
12. At or after p2 is in l2_2, p2 is in l2_3 OR p1 is in l2_3: p2 was in l2_3 after step 4, which is after p2 was in l2_2.

28. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (p2 and t1 are both in l1_1)
29. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1 (t1 is in l1_1, both locations are in city c1)

33. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1 (t1 is in l1_1, both locations are in city c1)
34. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (p1 is in t1, t1 is in l1_3)

At this point:

- Airplane a2 is in location l1_1 (airport).

- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (airport).
- Airplane a2 is in location l1_1 (airport).
- Package p1 is in location l1_1.
- Package p2 is in location l1_4.

I noticed there's a redundant action sequence (steps 16-21). After step 15, we already have p1 in l2_1. Then in steps 16-21, we move p1 to l2_2 and back to l2_1. We can skip this and directly to step 22.

Also notice that in step 20 I'm using loadtruck here for loading a package into an airplane. Let me fix this.

So, the refined plan is:

1. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
2. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
3. Drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
4. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
5. Drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2
6. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
7. Drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_3 c2
8. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
9. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
10. Drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
11. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
12. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
13. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
14. Drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
15. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
16. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
17. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
18. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
19. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
20. Drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
21. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
22. Loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
23. Loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
24. Flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
25. Unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
26. Unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
27. Drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
28. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
29. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
30. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
31. Drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
32. Loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
33. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
34. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
35. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
36. Drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1
37. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
38. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1
39. Loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
40. Drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
41. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

Wait, there's still an issue: steps 16-21 are exactly what I did in steps 16-21 before. Let me simplify the plan by removing these redundant steps.

After step 15:
- Truck t2 is in location l2_1.
- Package p1 is in location l2_1.
- Package p2 is in location l2_1.

We can go directly to step 22 (Loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1).

Updated plan:

1. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
2. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
3. Drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
4. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
5. Drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2
6. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
7. Drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_3 c2
8. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
9. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
10. Drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
11. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
12. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
13. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
14. Drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
15. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
16. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
17. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
18. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
19. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
20. Drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
21. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
22. Loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
23. Loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
24. Flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
25. Unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
26. Unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
27. Drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
28. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
29. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
30. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
31. Drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
32. Loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
33. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
34. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
35. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
36. Drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1
37. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
38. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1
39. Loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
40. Drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
41. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

I still have those redundant steps (16-21). Let me trace it once more.

After step 15:
- Truck t2 is in location l2_1.
- Package p1 is in location l2_1.
- Package p2 is in location l2_1.

I've checked all constraints, and I have:
1. p2 was in l2_3 (satisfies constraint 1)
2. p2 was in l2_1 (satisfies constraint 2)
3. p2 was in l2_3 before it was in l2_1 (satisfies constraint 3)
4. We are going to put p2 in l1_4 (satisfies constraint 4)
5. We are going to ensure p1 is in l1_3 before p2 is in l1_4 (satisfies constraint 5)
6. We are going to put p2 in l1_1 (satisfies constraint 6)
7. p1 was in l2_3 before p2 will be in l1_1 (satisfies constraint 7)
8. p1 was in l2_1 (satisfies constraint 8)

But for constraint 9, I need to ensure that after p1 is in l2_1, either p2 is in l2_4 or p1 is in l2_2. Since p2 is not in l2_4, I need to ensure p1 is in l2_2 after it was in l2_1.

So, even if the steps seem redundant, steps 16-21 are necessary to satisfy constraint 9. But we can simplify a bit:

16. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
17. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
18. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
19. Drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2

After step 18, p1 is in l2_2, which satisfies constraint 9. But we need to get back to l2_1 for the airplane.

Let's continue:

20. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
21. Drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
22. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
23. Loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
24. Loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
25. Flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
26. Unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
27. Unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

And the rest of the plan remains the same.

So, the updated plan is:

1. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
2. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
3. Drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
4. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
5. Drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2
6. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
7. Drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_3 c2
8. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

18. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
19. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
20. Drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
21. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
22. Loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
23. Loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
24. Flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
25. Unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
26. Unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
27. Drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
28. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
29. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
30. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
31. Drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
32. Loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
33. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
34. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
35. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
36. Drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1
37. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
38. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1
39. Loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
40. Drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
41. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

I think this is my final answer! Let's summarize this plan to ensure that we have everything in the right order. I'll omit everything else from this since the output is:
