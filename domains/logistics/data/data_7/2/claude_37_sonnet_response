Let's understand the problem step by step:

We have a world with:
- 2 cities (c1 and c2)
- Multiple locations in each city, including airports (l1_1 and l2_1 are airports)
- 2 packages (p1 and p2)
- 2 trucks (t1 and t2)
- 2 airplanes (a1 and a2)

The initial state:
- Locations l1_1, l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5 are in city c1
- Locations l2_1, l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5 are in city c2
- Package p1 is in location l1_1
- Package p2 is in location l2_5
- Truck t1 is in location l1_5
- Truck t2 is in location l2_4
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

The goal:
- Package p1 is in location l1_2
- Package p2 is in location l1_4

The constraints:
1. At some point, p2 is in l2_5 (which is the initial state, so this is already satisfied)
2. If p2 is ever in l2_5, then it must later be in l2_4
3. At some point, p2 is in l1_4 (this is part of the goal)
4. If p2 is in l1_4, then p1 must have been in l1_3 at an earlier state
5. At some point, p1 is in l1_3
6. At some point, p1 is in a2
7. At some point, p1 is in l2_2
8. At some point, p1 is in a1
9. At some point, p2 is in a1

Hmm, there's a mistake in the initial state. It says "Package t1 is in location l1_5" and "Package t2 is in location l2_4", but t1 and t2 are trucks, not packages. Similarly, it says "Package a1 is in location l1_1" and "Package a2 is in location l2_1", but a1 and a2 are airplanes, not packages. I think this is a typo, and the intended meaning is:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_5
- Truck t2 is in location l2_4
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

Let's plan how to satisfy all the constraints and reach the goal. I'll start with a high-level plan and then refine it.

Constraints 5, 7, 6, 8 require p1 to visit various locations. Let's sketch a possible route for p1:
- p1 starts in l1_1
- p1 needs to go to l1_3 (constraint 5)
- p1 needs to go to a1 (constraint 8)
- p1 needs to go to l2_2 (constraint 7)
- p1 needs to go to a2 (constraint 6)
- p1 needs to end up in l1_2 (goal)

Constraints 1, 2, 9, 3 require p2 to visit various locations. Let's sketch a possible route for p2:
- p2 starts in l2_5
- p2 needs to go to l2_4 (constraint 2)
- p2 needs to go to a1 (constraint 9)
- p2 needs to go to l1_4 (constraint 3 and goal)

Now, let's also consider constraint 4, which says that p2 can only be in l1_4 if p1 has already been in l1_3. This means we need to make sure p1 visits l1_3 before p2 reaches l1_4.

Let me create a more detailed plan, considering the available actions and the locations of the vehicles.

For package p1:
1. p1 starts in l1_1, where a1 is also located. We can load p1 into a1 (satisfies constraint 8).
2. Fly a1 to l2_1.
3. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1.
4. We need to get p1 to l2_2 (constraint 7). We can use t2, which is currently in l2_4. We need to:
   a. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
   b. Load p1 into t2 at l2_1.
   c. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2.
   d. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_2.
5. p1 is now in l2_2 (satisfies constraint 7). We need to get p1 into a2 (constraint 6). a2 is currently in l2_1. We need to:
   a. Load p1 into t2 at l2_2.
   b. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1.
   c. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1.
   d. Load p1 into a2 at l2_1.
6. p1 is now in a2 (satisfies constraint 6). We need to get p1 to l1_3 (constraint 5). We need to:
   a. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
   b. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1.
   c. Use t1, which is currently in l1_5, to get p1 to l1_3:
      i. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_1.
      ii. Load p1 into t1 at l1_1.
      iii. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_3.
      iv. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_3.
7. p1 is now in l1_3 (satisfies constraint 5). We need to get p1 to l1_2 (goal). We need to:
   a. Load p1 into t1 at l1_3.
   b. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_2.
   c. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_2.

For package p2:
1. p2 starts in l2_5. We need to get p2 to l2_4 (constraint 2). We can use t2 for this. We need to:
   a. Drive t2 from l2_2 (which is where it ended up in the p1 plan) to l2_5.
   b. Load p2 into t2 at l2_5.
   c. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_4.
   d. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_4.
2. p2 is now in l2_4 (satisfies constraint 2). We need to get p2 into a1 (constraint 9). a1 is currently in l2_1 (from the p1 plan). We need to:
   a. Load p2 into t2 at l2_4.
   b. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
   c. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1.
   d. Load p2 into a1 at l2_1.
3. p2 is now in a1 (satisfies constraint 9). We need to get p2 to l1_4 (goal and constraint 3). We need to:
   a. Fly a1 from l2_1 to l1_1.
   b. Unload p2 from a1 at l1_1.
   c. Use t1, which is currently in l1_2 (from the p1 plan), to get p2 to l1_4:
      i. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1.
      ii. Load p2 into t1 at l1_1.
      iii. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_4.
      iv. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_4.

However, I need to ensure that p1 is in l1_3 before p2 is in l1_4 (constraint 4). Looking at the above plan, p1 is in l1_3 during step 7 of the p1 plan, and p2 is in l1_4 during step 3.d.iv of the p2 plan. So as long as we execute the plans in the order I've outlined (first all of the p1 plan, then all of the p2 plan), this constraint should be satisfied.

Let me now convert the high-level plan into a specific sequence of actions.

Actually, let me double-check for any optimizations or issues with the plan before converting it to specific actions. I'm wondering if there are some redundancies or whether the sequence I've designed is optimal.

Actually, I think I was being too rigid, planning p1's path and then p2's path separately. I should consider a more integrated plan. Let's replan:

1. Initial state:
   - p1 is in l1_1, where a1 is also located.
   - p2 is in l2_5.
   - t1 is in l1_5.
   - t2 is in l2_4.
   - a1 is in l1_1.
   - a2 is in l2_1.

2. First, let's load p1 into a1 (satisfies constraint 8):
   ```
   loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
   ```

3. Fly a1 to l2_1:
   ```
   flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
   ```

4. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1:
   ```
   unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
   ```

5. Now, we need to get p1 to l2_2 (constraint 7). We'll use t2, which is currently in l2_4:
   ```
   drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
   loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
   drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
   unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
   ```

6. p1 is now in l2_2 (satisfies constraint 7). We need to get p1 into a2 (constraint 6). a2 is currently in l2_1:
   ```
   drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
   loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
   ```

7. p1 is now in a2 (satisfies constraint 6). We need to get p1 to l1_3 (constraint 5). We'll fly a2 to l1_1 and use t1 to get to l1_3:
   ```
   flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
   unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
   drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
   loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
   drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
   unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
   ```

8. p1 is now in l1_3 (satisfies constraint 5). We need to get p1 to l1_2 (goal). We'll use t1:
   ```
   loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
   drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1
   unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
   ```

9. p1 is now in l1_2 (goal). Now, let's handle p2. p2 starts in l2_5 (satisfies constraint 1). We need to get p2 to l2_4 (constraint 2). We'll use t2, which is currently in l2_1:
   ```
   drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
   loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
   drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2
   unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
   ```

10. p2 is now in l2_4 (satisfies constraint 2). We need to get p2 into a1 (constraint 9). a1 is currently in l2_1:
    ```
    loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
    drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
    unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
    loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
    ```

11. p2 is now in a1 (satisfies constraint 9). We need to get p2 to l1_4 (goal and constraint 3). We'll fly a1 to l1_1 and use t1, which is currently in l1_2, to get to l1_4:
    ```
    flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
    unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
    drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
    loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
    drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
    unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
    ```

12. p2 is now in l1_4 (satisfies constraint 3 and goal).

Checking the constraint: p1 is in l1_3 (at step 7) before p2 is in l1_4 (at step 12), so constraint 4 is satisfied.

Let me check our plan once more.

This actually looks pretty good. Let me double-check the initial state though, there was a mistake I noticed earlier.

Initial state:
- Locations l1_1, l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5 are in city c1
- Locations l2_1, l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5 are in city c2
- Package p1 is in location l1_1
- Package p2 is in location l2_5
- Truck t1 is in location l1_5
- Truck t2 is in location l2_4
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

Yes, the problem mentioned "Package t1 is in location l1_5", but t1 is a truck, so I'm assuming this is a typo. Using the initial state as I've listed it, the plan above should work. Let me check for any optimizations or issues.

Actually, I think the plan is fine and addresses all the constraints and the goal. Let's proceed with the plan:

```
loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
```

Wait, let me check the unloadairplane action. The description says:
```
"loadairplane p ap l": Unload package p from airplane ap in location l.
```
I think there's a typo in the action name. It should be "unloadairplane" not "loadairplane". But the action descriptions that follow use "unloadairplane". So, I'll stick with "unloadairplane" for consistency.

Let me check the rest of the plan one more time:

1. We load p1 into a1 at l1_1.
2. We fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
3. We unload p1 from a1 at l2_1.
4. We drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
5. We load p1 into t2 at l2_1.
6. We drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2.
7. We unload p1 from t2 at l2_2 (satisfies constraint 7).
8. We drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1.
9. We load p1 into a2 at l2_1 (satisfies constraint 6).
10. We fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
11. We unload p1 from a2 at l1_1.
12. We drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_1.
13. We load p1 into t1 at l1_1.
14. We drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_3.
15. We unload p1 from t1 at l1_3 (satisfies constraint 5).
16. We load p1 into t1 at l1_3.
17. We drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_2.
18. We unload p1 from t1 at l1_2 (satisfies the goal for p1).
19. We drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_5.
20. We load p2 into t2 at l2_5 (satisfies constraint 1).
21. We drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_4.
22. We unload p2 from t2 at l2_4 (satisfies constraint 2).
23. We load p2 into t2 at l2_4.
24. We drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
25. We unload p2 from t2 at l2_1.
26. We load p2 into a1 at l2_1 (satisfies constraint 9).
27. We fly a1 from l2_1 to l1_1.
28. We unload p2 from a1 at l1_1.
29. We drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1.
30. We load p2 into t1 at l1_1.
31. We drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_4.
32. We unload p2 from t1 at l1_4 (satisfies constraint 3 and the goal for p2).

This plan satisfies all the constraints and goals. p1 is in l1_3 (step 15) before p2 is in l1_4 (step 32), so constraint 4 is satisfied.

I think this is the most direct plan given the constraints. Let me check one more time for any optimizations.

Actually, I think we can optimize the plan a bit. Instead of just using a1 to get p1 to l2_1, we could use it to get p1 directly to l2_2 if a1 could land at l2_2. But since l2_2 is not an airport, we need to use a truck for that last part.

But from the problem description, after constraint 2, "p2 goes from l2_4 to a1 to l1_4". But if we're using t2 to get p2 from l2_4 to a1, then to get to l1_4, we'd need a1 to fly from l2_1 to l1_1. Then we use t1 to get p2 from l1_1 to l1_4. This is exactly what our plan does, so it seems like the problem's constraints already embody the most direct path.

Alright, I think the plan is optimal given the constraints. Let's format it as required:

```
loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
```

Ok, I just realize 'load' and 'unload' for airplanes is a bit different in this problem specification:
- "loadairplane p ap l": Load package p in airplane ap. Both p and ap are in location l.
- "loadairplane p ap l": Unload package p from airplane ap in location l. (There's a typo here. Should be "unloadairplane".)

Let me correct the plan:

```
loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
```

I think we're good! Actually I haven't changed anything. But I did check that there is indeed a typo in the problem statement.
