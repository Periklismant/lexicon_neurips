Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. Hmm, the goal is to get p1 to l1_2 and p2 to l1_4, but there are a bunch of constraints to satisfy. Let me start by understanding the initial state and the constraints.

First, the initial state: p1 is in l1_1, which is an airport in c1. p2 is in l2_5 in c2. The trucks and airplanes are in various locations. So, t1 is in l1_5, t2 in l2_4. Airplanes a1 is in l1_1, a2 in l2_1.

The goal is p1 at l1_2 and p2 at l1_4. But l1_4 is in c1, so p2 needs to move from c2 to c1. That probably requires using airplanes. Let's see.

Constraints: Oh, there are a lot. Let's list them out:

1. p2 must be in l2_5 at some state. Initially, p2 is in l2_5, so that's already satisfied. Wait, the original state says "Package p2 is in location l2_5". So that constraint is met from the start. So maybe that's already covered. But need to check if the problem requires it to be true in at least one state, which it is in the initial state. So that's okay.

Wait, no. Wait, the original state says "Package p2 is in location l2_5". So the first constraint is already satisfied because the initial state includes that. So no action needed for that. But the problem's constraints might still require that it remains or something else. Wait, no. The first constraint says "The following expression must hold in at least one state: p2 is in l2_5". Since the initial state has that, we don't need to do anything for that.

Second constraint: If in some state s, p2 is in l2_5, then either in s or later, p2 must be in l2_4. Since the initial state has p2 in l2_5, this means that at some point after the initial state, p2 must be moved to l2_4. Because the initial state s0 has p2 in l2_5, so we must ensure that either in s0 (which it is) or in some state after, p2 is in l2_4. Wait, but the constraint is if p2 is in l2_5 in s, then p2 must be in l2_4 in s or a later state. Since in s0, p2 is in l2_5, then we need to ensure that either in s0, p2 is in l2_4 (which it's not) or in some state after s0. So p2 must be moved to l2_4 at some point after the initial state. But how? Because in the initial state, p2 is at l2_5. So we need to move p2 from l2_5 to l2_4. But how? There's a truck t2 in l2_4. Wait, but p2 is in l2_5. So maybe use truck t2 to move it. Wait, t2 is at l2_4. So to move p2 from l2_5 to l2_4, we need a truck that can go to l2_5. But t2 is in l2_4. So drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_5 (if possible), then load p2 into t2, then drive back to l2_4 and unload. But that's extra steps. But maybe necessary to satisfy the constraint.

Third constraint: p2 must be in l1_4 in at least one state, which is the goal, so that's covered if we achieve the goal.

Fourth constraint: If p2 is in l1_4 in some state, then there must be an earlier state where p1 is in l1_3. So before p2 reaches l1_4, p1 must have been in l1_3 at some point.

Fifth: p1 must be in l1_3 at some state.

Sixth: p1 must be in a2 (airplane a2) at some state.

Seventh: p1 must be in l2_2 at some state.

Eighth: p1 must be in a1 (airplane a1) at some state.

Ninth: p2 must be in a1 at some state.

Wow, that's a lot of constraints. So need to plan the movements of both packages considering all these.

Let's start with p1. The goal is to get p1 to l1_2. Initially, p1 is at l1_1 (airport). So maybe load it onto a truck and drive it, but l1_1 is an airport. Wait, trucks can only move within their city. So in c1, the locations are l1_1 to l1_5. So to get p1 from l1_1 to l1_2, since they are both in c1, maybe use a truck. But where is the truck t1? t1 is at l1_5. So drive t1 to l1_1, load p1, drive to l1_2, unload. But that's possible. But let's check the constraints.

But wait, p1 needs to be in a1 (constraint 8) and in a2 (constraint 6), and in l2_2 (constraint7), which is in city c2. So p1 has to move to c2. That complicates things. Because to get p1 to l2_2, which is in c2, we need to use an airplane. Because airplanes can fly between airports.

So the plan for p1 might involve:

1. Load p1 into airplane a1 (which is at l1_1), fly a1 to l2_1 (the airport in c2), unload p1 there. Then maybe load into a2 (if a2 is at l2_1), then fly to another location? Wait, but l2_2 is a location in c2. So once p1 is in c2's airport l2_1, we can use a truck to move it to l2_2. But the trucks in c2 are t2, which is at l2_4. So drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1, load p1 into t2, drive to l2_2, unload. Then maybe load back into a2, fly to c1's airport, then move to l1_2.

But this is getting complicated. Also, need to satisfy the constraint that when p2 is in l1_4, p1 was in l1_3 before. So p1 must be in l1_3 at some point. How to do that? Maybe after moving p1 from l2_2 back to c1, unload it at l1_3, then move to l1_2.

But let's outline steps for p1:

- Initially at l1_1 (airport in c1).

- Load into a1 (so in a1's location l1_1). Action: loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1.

- Fly a1 to l2_1 (airport in c2). Now p1 is in a1 at l2_1.

- Unload p1 from a1 into l2_1. Now p1 is in l2_1.

- Need to get p1 to l2_2. Use truck t2, which is in l2_4. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1 (possible since they are in c2). Then load p1 into t2, drive to l2_2, unload. So:

Actions:

drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2

loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2

unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

Now p1 is in l2_2 (satisfies constraint 7).

Then, to get p1 back to c1, perhaps load into a2 (since a2 is in l2_1). Wait, a2 is in l2_1. So after unloading p1 at l2_2, drive t2 back to l2_1 (if needed), load p1 into a2, fly a2 to l1_1 (airport in c1). Then unload p1. But then, to get p1 to l1_3, use truck t1. So drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_1, load p1, drive to l1_3, unload. Then drive to l1_2, unload. But how?

Wait, let's see. Let me outline the steps for p1:

1. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (so p1 is in a1, which is at l1_1).

2. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (now a1 is in l2_1, p1 is in a1).

3. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 (p1 is in l2_1).

4. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2 (move t2 to l2_1).

5. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (p1 in t2).

6. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2 (p1 now at l2_2, unloaded here).

7. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (now p1 is in l2_2; constraint 7 met).

Then, need to get p1 into a2. a2 is at l2_1. So drive t2 back to l2_1, load p1 into a2.

8. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2.

9. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (now p1 is in a2; constraint 6 met).

Then fly a2 to l1_1.

10. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

11. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (p1 is in l1_1 again).

Now to get p1 to l1_3, use truck t1 which is in l1_5. Drive t1 to l1_1.

12. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1.

13. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1.

14. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1.

15. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (now p1 is in l1_3; constraint 5 met).

Then, drive to l1_2.

16. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1.

17. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 (goal achieved).

But this is a lot of steps, but let's check if this meets all constraints.

Now, for p2. The goal is to have p2 in l1_4. Initially, p2 is in l2_5. So we need to move p2 from l2_5 (c2) to l1_4 (c1). So likely using airplane.

But the constraints also say that p2 must be in l2_5 in some state (already in initial state) and that if p2 is in l2_5 in a state, then in that state or later, it's in l2_4. But in the initial state, p2 is in l2_5, so we need to move it to l2_4 at some point. But how? Since t2 is in l2_4, but p2 is in l2_5. So need to drive t2 to l2_5, load p2, drive back to l2_4, unload. Then later move p2 via airplane to c1.

Wait, but let's see. Let's process p2's movement.

Initial state: p2 in l2_5.

Constraints:

- Must be in l2_5 in at least one state: done.

- If p2 is in l2_5 in a state, then in that state or later, p2 is in l2_4. So after initial state, we need to move p2 to l2_4.

So steps for p2:

1. Move t2 from l2_4 to l2_5 (since t2 is initially in l2_4).

drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2.

2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5.

3. drive back to l2_4.

drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2.

4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (now p2 is in l2_4, satisfying the second constraint).

Then, to get p2 to c1, we need to load it into an airplane. The airports are l2_1 in c2 and l1_1 in c1. So first, move p2 to l2_1.

But how? Truck t2 is in l2_4. So drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1, load p2 into airplane a2 (which is in l2_1), then fly to l1_1, unload. Then, move via truck t1 to l1_4.

Wait, but a2 is initially in l2_1. So steps:

5. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2.

6. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (now p2 is in a2).

7. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

8. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (p2 is in l1_1).

Then, use truck t1 to move p2 from l1_1 to l1_4. But t1 is in l1_5. So drive t1 to l1_1, load p2, drive to l1_4, unload.

9. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1.

10. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

11. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1.

12. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (goal achieved).

But wait, in step 6, when we load p2 into a2, that's in l2_1. Then flying to l1_1, unloading there. Then moving via truck. But also, there's a constraint that p2 must be in a1 at some state. So how to get p2 into a1?

Hmm, a1 is in l1_1 initially, but in step 7, when a2 flies to l1_1, maybe p2 is unloaded there. Then, perhaps load p2 into a1 (which is in l1_1), then unload again. But that would require moving p2 into a1. For example:

After step 8 (p2 in l1_1), load into a1.

13. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (so now p2 is in a1; this satisfies constraint 9).

14. Then unload p2 from a1.

unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1.

Then proceed to load into t1.

Wait, but this would add steps. But maybe necessary. Let's check.

So the steps for p2 would be:

After step 8 (p2 in l1_1):

9. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (now in a1; satisfies constraint 9).

10. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (back to l1_1).

Then proceed to move via t1.

11. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1.

12. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

13. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1.

14. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4.

But this adds steps. However, it's necessary to have p2 in a1 at some state (constraint 9). So this is needed.

But let's check the constraints again. So p2 must be in a1 at some state, which is done in step 9.

Now, combining all these steps for p1 and p2, but need to interleave them properly, considering dependencies. Also, the constraint that when p2 is in l1_4, there must be an earlier state where p1 was in l1_3. So in the plan, the step where p1 is in l1_3 (step 15) must come before p2 reaches l1_4 (step 14).

But let's outline the entire plan, combining both packages' steps.

Let me try to sequence the actions in order, making sure dependencies are met.

First, handle p1's movement to l2_2:

1. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

2. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

3. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

Then move t2 to l2_1 to pick up p1:

4. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2

5. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

6. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2

7. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (p1 in l2_2; constraint7)

Then, move p1 back to a2:

8. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2

9. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (p1 in a2; constraint6)

10. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

11. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

Now, move p1 to l1_3 via t1:

12. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1

13. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

14. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1

15. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (p1 in l1_3; constraint5)

Then, to l1_2:

16. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1

17. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 (goal for p1)

Now, handle p2's movement:

First, move p2 from l2_5 to l2_4 (to satisfy constraint after initial state):

18. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2 (but wait, after step8, t2 was in l2_1. So step4 moved t2 to l2_1, step8 moves t2 back to l2_1. So after step8, t2 is in l2_1. To move to l2_5, need to drive from l2_1 to l2_5.

Wait, but in the initial state, t2 is in l2_4. Then step4 moves it to l2_1. Then step8 moves it back to l2_1 (wait, step8 is drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2). So after step8, t2 is in l2_1. To handle p2, which is in l2_5, we need to move t2 to l2_5. But let's see:

Wait, maybe the steps for p2 need to be interleaved with p1's steps. Because p2's movement to l2_4 needs to happen after the initial state. Let's see:

But initially, p2 is in l2_5. The constraint says that if p2 is in l2_5 (which it is in the initial state), then p2 must be in l2_4 in that state or later. So we need to have p2 in l2_4 after the initial state. So steps to move p2 from l2_5 to l2_4 must occur early in the plan.

But how? Because initially, t2 is in l2_4. So drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_5, load p2, drive back to l2_4, unload. So these steps should be done before moving t2 for p1's steps.

But in the initial steps for p1, we moved t2 to l2_1. So maybe we need to adjust the order.

Let me restructure the plan to handle p2's movement first.

Here's a possible sequence:

First, move p2 from l2_5 to l2_4:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2 (t2 moves to l2_5)

2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5

3. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2

4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (now p2 is in l2_4, satisfying the constraint)

Then proceed with p1's steps:

5. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

6. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

7. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

But to load p1 into t2, which is now in l2_4. Wait, after step4, t2 is in l2_4. So to move t2 to l2_1 to pick up p1:

8. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2

9. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

10. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2

11. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (constraint7)

Then move p1 to a2:

12. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2

13. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (constraint6)

14. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

15. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

Now, move p1 to l1_3:

16. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1

17. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

18. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1

19. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (constraint5)

Then to l1_2:

20. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1

21. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 (p1 goal)

Now, handle p2's movement from l2_4 to l1_4:

But after step4, p2 is in l2_4. So need to move it to l1_4. How?

We need to get p2 from l2_4 (c2) to l1_4 (c1). So use an airplane. Let's use a1 or a2. a2 is in l1_1 after step14. Or maybe a1 is still in l2_1.

Wait, after step6, a1 is in l2_1. Then steps proceed. So a1 is in l2_1 until moved again.

So to move p2 from l2_4 to l2_1 (airport):

22. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2 (t2 was in l2_1 after step12)

Wait, after step12, t2 was in l2_2, then step12 moves to l2_1. So after step12, t2 is in l2_1. Then step13 is loading p1 into a2, then step14 flies a2 to l1_1.

So t2 is in l2_1. To get p2 from l2_4 to l2_1, need to drive t2 back to l2_4.

Wait, but after step4, p2 is in l2_4. So to load p2 into an airplane, we need to move it to the airport l2_1. So steps for p2:

22. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2 (t2 moves from l2_1 to l2_4)

23. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (p2 is in t2)

24. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2 (drive back to airport)

25. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (p2 in l2_1)

26. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (a1 is in l2_1 from step6)

27. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1 (now p2 is in a1 in l1_1)

28. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (p2 in l1_1; satisfies constraint9 because it was loaded into a1 at step26)

Now, move p2 to l1_4 using t1:

But t1 is in l1_3 after step19. So need to drive t1 to l1_1.

29. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1

30. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

31. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

32. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (p2 goal)

But also, when p2 is unloaded at l1_4 (step32), we need to ensure that p1 was in l1_3 earlier. In step19, p1 was in l1_3, which is before step32. So that's satisfied.

Now, checking constraints:

- p2 in l2_5 initially: yes.

- p2 in l2_4 after step4: yes.

- p2 in l1_4 at step32: yes.

- p1 in l1_3 at step19: yes.

- p1 in a2 at step13: yes.

- p1 in l2_2 at step11: yes.

- p1 in a1 at step5: yes.

- p2 in a1 at step26: yes.

So all constraints are met.

But wait, let's check the sequence of actions again to make sure there are no errors.

But this plan has 32 steps. Maybe there's a more optimal way. Let's see if we can shorten it.

Wait, maybe some steps can be merged. For example, when moving p2, after moving to l2_4, instead of moving back and forth with t2, perhaps use another truck or optimize.

But given the constraints, perhaps this is necessary.

But let's see. Let's count the steps for the combined plan.

Wait, the steps I outlined above have 32 actions, which seems long. But the problem requires an optimal plan. So maybe there's a shorter way.

Alternative approach: Use a1 to carry both p1 and p2.

Wait, for example:

p1's steps:

1. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

2. fly a1 to l2_1.

3. unload p1.

4. load into t2, drive to l2_2, unload (steps4-7).

Then, to get p1 into a2, drive t2 back, load into a2, fly to l1_1.

But perhaps after that, p1 is unloaded in l1_1, then use t1 to take to l1_3, then l1_2.

For p2:

After moving to l2_4 (steps1-4), then drive t2 to l2_4 to load p2, drive to l2_1, load into a1, fly to l1_1, unload, then use t1 to take to l1_4.

But then, when flying a1 back to l1_1, it can carry p2.

But in this case, p2 would be loaded into a1 in l2_1, satisfying constraint9 (p2 in a1).

So let's try to see:

Combined steps:

For p2:

Initial steps1-4: move p2 to l2_4.

Then, drive t2 to l2_4 to l2_1 (airport).

5. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2

6. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (but p2 is in l2_4, so steps1-4 have p2 in l2_4. Then step5 is driving t2 from l2_4 to l2_1. Wait, after step4, p2 is in l2_4 (unloaded). So to move p2 to l2_1, need to load into t2 again.

Wait, after step4, p2 is in l2_4 (unloaded). So to move p2 to l2_1, need to load it into t2 (which is in l2_4 after step4).

So after step4:

5. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

6. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2

7. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (now p2 in l2_1)

8. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (a1 is in l2_1 after step2)

9. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1

10. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (p2 in l1_1; constraint9 met)

Then, move p2 via t1 to l1_4.

11. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1

12. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

13. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

14. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (goal)

Now, for p1:

Steps1-4 (p2's steps) are done first.

Then p1's steps:

15. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (but a1 is in l2_1 after step2. Wait, no: step2 is part of p1's initial steps. Hmm, this is getting mixed up.

Wait, maybe I need to interleave the steps properly. Let's try to outline the entire plan with both packages.

Alternative plan:

1. (p2) drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2

2. (p2) loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5

3. (p2) drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2

4. (p2) unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (p2 in l2_4)

5. (p1) loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

6. (p1) flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

7. (p1) unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 (p1 in l2_1)

8. (p2) loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

9. (p2) drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2

10. (p2) unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

11. (p2) loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (now a1 is in l2_1)

12. (p1) loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (t2 is now in l2_1)

13. (p1) drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2

14. (p1) unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (p1 in l2_2)

15. (p2) flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1 (p2 in a1)

16. (p2) unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

17. (p1) drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2

18. (p1) loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

19. (p1) flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

20. (p1) unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

21. (p1) drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1

22. (p1) loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

23. (p1) drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1

24. (p1) unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (constraint5)

25. (p2) loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (wait, p2 is in l1_1 after step16, and t1 is in l1_1 after step21. So after step21, t1 is in l1_1. So after step20, p1 is in l1_1. Then step21 moves t1 to l1_1. Then step22 loads p1 into t1, step23 drives to l1_3.

Then for p2, after step16, p2 is in l1_1. So to load into t1, which is in l1_1:

25. (p2) loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (after step21, t1 is in l1_1)

26. (p2) drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

27. (p2) unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (goal)

28. (p1) drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1 (assuming t1 is in l1_3 after step24)

29. (p1) unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 (goal)

But this requires that after step24, t1 is in l1_3. Then step28 drives to l1_2.

But also, step26 for p2 requires t1 to be in l1_1. So steps21: t1 is driven to l1_1. Step22: load p1 into t1. step23: drive to l1_3, unload p1. Then t1 is in l1_3. So step26 would require t1 to be in l1_1 again, but after step23, it's in l1_3. So this is a problem. 

Hmm, this suggests that the steps for p2 to move from l1_1 to l1_4 must happen before step23.

So perhaps after step20 (p1 in l1_1), step21 is moving t1 to l1_1.

Then step22: load p1 into t1.

Then step23: drive to l1_3, unload p1.

Then step24: drive t1 back to l1_1 to pick up p2.

But that would add steps.

Alternatively, maybe use truck t1 to carry both p1 and p2. But trucks can carry multiple packages, but the problem doesn't specify any capacity limits, so assuming they can carry multiple.

But in this case, after loading p1 into t1 and driving to l1_3, unload p1. Then drive back to l1_1 to pick up p2 and take to l1_4.

So steps:

21. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1

22. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

23. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1

24. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (p1 in l1_3)

25. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1

26. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

27. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

28. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (p2 goal)

29. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1 (but p1 is already in l1_3, so need to move p1 to l1_2)

Wait, no. After step24, p1 is in l1_3. Then t1 is in l1_3. To move p1 to l1_2, need to load p1 into t1 again.

So:

25. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1

26. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

27. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

28. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

29. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1

30. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3

31. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1

32. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2

This adds even more steps. So this approach might not be optimal.

Alternative idea: Have t1 carry p2 to l1_4 after dropping p1 in l1_3.

So after step24 (p1 in l1_3, t1 in l1_3), drive t1 back to l1_1 (step25), load p2 (step26), drive to l1_4 (step27), unload (step28). Then drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_3 (step29), load p1 (step30), drive to l1_2 (step31), unload (step32). But this is more steps.

Alternatively, after p1 is unloaded in l1_3 (step24), use a different truck. But there's only t1 in c1. So no, must use t1.

This is getting complicated. Perhaps the initial plan with 32 steps is the only way, but I'm supposed to find an optimal plan. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Wait, let's think about the airplanes. a1 and a2 are both available. Maybe use both to carry packages.

For p1: Use a1 to fly to l2_1, then use a2 to fly back. But a2 starts in l2_1. So perhaps:

For p1:

1. load into a1 at l1_1.

2. fly to l2_1.

3. unload.

4. load into a2.

5. fly back to l1_1.

6. unload.

Then move via truck to l1_3 and l1_2.

This uses a2, which is in l2_1 initially. So step4: load p1 into a2 in l2_1.

Then fly a2 to l1_1.

Then unload.

This way, p1 is in a2 (constraint6).

For p2:

After moving to l2_4, drive to l2_1, load into a1 (which is in l2_1 after step2).

Fly a1 to l1_1, unload. Then move via truck.

But also, need to have p2 in a1 (constraint9).

So steps:

For p2:

After initial steps to move to l2_4.

drive t2 to l2_1, load p2 into a1, fly to l1_1.

Then unload and move via t1.

This would satisfy constraint9.

Now, combining all steps:

p1:

1. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

2. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

3. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

4. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

5. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

6. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

7. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1

8. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

9. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1

10. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3

11. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1

12. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2

p2:

13. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2

14. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5

15. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2

16. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

17. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2

18. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

19. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (p2 in l2_1)

20. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (a1 is in l2_1 after step2)

21. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1

22. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

23. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (t1 is in l1_1 after step7)

24. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

25. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

Checking constraints:

- p2 in l2_5: steps13-14.

- After p2 is in l2_5 (step14), it's moved to l2_4 (step16): constraint2 satisfied.

- p2 in l1_4: step25.

- Before step25, p1 is in l1_3 (step10): constraint4 satisfied.

- p1 in l1_3: step10.

- p1 in a2: step4.

- p1 in l2_2: not achieved. Oh, this is a problem. The constraint requires p1 to be in l2_2 at some state.

So this plan doesn't meet constraint7 (p1 in l2_2). So this approach is invalid.

Thus, the earlier approach where p1 is moved to l2_2 is necessary.

So that's why the previous plan had p1 in l2_2.

So the initial long plan is necessary to satisfy all constraints.

But perhaps there's a way to shorten it.

Another thought: After p1 is in a2 (step13 in the initial long plan), when a2 flies to l1_1, p1 is unloaded there. Then, when moving p2 to l1_1 via a1, p2 is loaded into a1 (step26 in the initial plan), which is in l2_1. Then, when a1 flies to l1_1, p2 is in a1, meeting constraint9. Then, p1 is moved to l1_3 via t1, which meets the constraint for p2's arrival in l1_4.

But it's challenging to find a shorter path while meeting all constraints.

Given the time constraints, perhaps the initial long plan is the correct one, even though it's lengthy. But maybe there's a way to interleave actions to reduce steps.

For example, after moving p1 to l2_2, instead of driving t2 back to l2_1, perhaps use another airplane or reuse a1.

Wait, but a1 is in l2_1 after step2. Once p1 is in l2_2, to get into a2, which is in l2_1, need to move t2 back to l2_1.

Alternatively, fly a2 to l2_2's airport, but airports are only l1_1 and l2_1. So no, airplanes can only land at airports. So l2_2 is not an airport. So cannot fly there.

Thus, the steps are necessary.

I think given the constraints, the initial plan with 32 steps is necessary, but I'm not sure if it's the optimal (shortest possible). However, considering the constraints, especially the need to have p1 in l2_2 and a2, and p2 in a1, this plan might be the minimal one.

But the user says to provide an optimal plan with minimal steps. So perhaps there's a shorter way.

Alternative approach:

For p1:

1. load into a1, fly to l2_1.

2. unload, load into t2, drive to l2_2, unload.

3. load into a2, fly to l1_1.

4. unload, load into t1, drive to l1_3, unload.

5. drive to l1_2, unload.

For p2:

6. drive t2 to l2_5, load, drive to l2_4, unload.

7. drive t2 to l2_1, load into a1, fly to l1_1.

8. unload, load into t1, drive to l1_4, unload.

But this would require t2 to be used for both p1 and p2 in different steps. Let's see:

Steps:

For p2:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2

2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5

3. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2

4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

For p1:

5. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

6. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

7. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

8. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2 (move t2 to l2_1)

9. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

10. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2

11. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (constraint7)

12. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2

13. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

14. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

15. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

16. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1

17. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

18. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1

19. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (constraint5)

20. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1

21. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 (goal)

For p2:

22. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2

23. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

24. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2

25. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

26. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

27. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1

28. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (constraint9)

29. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

30. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

31. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (goal)

This plan has 31 steps. But still, perhaps there's redundancy. For example, steps22-24 for p2: after step4, p2 is in l2_4. To move to l2_1, steps22-24 are driving t2 to l2_4, loading p2, driving back to l2_1. But after step4, t2 is in l2_4. So steps22-24 can be replaced by:

22. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

23. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2

24. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

This saves two steps (no need to drive t2 to l2_4 again, since after step4, t2 is already there).

So adjusting:

For p2:

After step4 (p2 in l2_4, t2 in l2_4):

5. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

6. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2

7. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

Then proceed to load into a1.

This reduces the steps.

Revised plan:

For p2:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2

2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5

3. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2

4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

5. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

6. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2

7. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

8. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

9. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1

10. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

11. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

12. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

13. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

This saves steps for p2.

For p1:

14. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

15. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

16. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

17. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2 (after step7, t2 is in l2_1)

18. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

19. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (constraint7)

Wait, no. After step7, t2 is in l2_1. So step17: drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2.

20. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (but p1 is in l2_1 after step16).

Wait, no. After step16, p1 is in l2_1 (unloaded from a1). So to load into t2, which is in l2_1 (after step7), then drive to l2_2.

So steps:

14. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

15. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

16. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

17. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

18. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2

19. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (constraint7)

20. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2

21. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

22. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

23. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

24. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1

25. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

26. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1

27. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (constraint5)

28. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1

29. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 (goal)

Now combining all steps:

Total steps: 29.

Checking constraints:

- p2 in l2_5: steps1-2.

- p2 in l2_4: step4.

- p2 in l1_4: step13.

- p1 in l1_3: step27.

- p1 in a2: step21.

- p1 in l2_2: step19.

- p1 in a1: step14.

- p2 in a1: step8.

All constraints are met.

Now, checking if this plan is shorter. It has 29 steps.

But is there a way to further shorten it?

For example, after p1 is unloaded in l2_1 (step16), can we directly load into a2 instead of using t2?

But a2 is in l2_1 initially. So after step16:

17. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

18. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

19. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

Then use t1 to move to l1_3 and l1_2.

But this skips the need to go to l2_2, which is required for constraint7.

So this approach would not satisfy the constraint that p1 must be in l2_2.

Thus, that's necessary.

So the plan must include moving p1 to l2_2.

Thus, the steps involving t2 driving to l2_2 are necessary.

So the 29-step plan is necessary.

But perhaps there's a way to interleave steps.

For example, after moving p2 to l2_1 (step7), we can load p2 into a1 (step8) and fly to l1_1 (step9) while also moving p1 to l2_2.

But I think the sequence is correct.

Thus, the optimal plan should be the one that has 29 steps, meeting all constraints.
