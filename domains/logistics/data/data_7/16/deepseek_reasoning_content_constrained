Okay, let's try to figure out how to solve this planning problem. The goal is to get package p1 to l2_3 and p2 to l1_4, while satisfying all the constraints. Hmm, let's start by understanding the initial state and the constraints.

First, initial state: p1 is in l1_5 (city c1), p2 is in l2_2 (city c2). Trucks t1 is in l1_4, t2 in l2_5. Airplanes a1 is in l1_1 (c1's airport), a2 in l2_1 (c2's airport). So, we need to move p1 from c1 to c2's l2_3 and p2 from c2 to c1's l1_4.

Constraints are quite a lot. Let's list them out:

1. At some state, p2 must be in l2_1. And if that's true, then before that, either p1 is in l2_1 or p2 is in l1_1.

2. At some state, p1 must be in l1_1. If p1 is in l1_1 in state s, then p2 must be in l1_1 at s or after.

3. At some state, p2 must be in a1 or in l1_3.

4. At some state, p2 must be in l1_4 (which is part of the goal, so that's covered, but maybe need to have it earlier?).

5. When p2 is in l1_4, there must be an earlier state where p1 is in l2_2.

6. p2 must be in a1 at some state.

7. p2 must be in l2_5 or l1_2 at some state.

8. p2 must be in l1_5 at some state.

Also, the goal requires p1 in l2_3 and p2 in l1_4. Let's think about the steps.

First, moving p1 from l1_5 to l2_3. Since l2_3 is in city c2, which is a different city. So, we need to use an airplane. To get p1 to c2, we need to transport it via airplane. Similarly, p2 needs to go from c2 to c1.

Let's think for p1: l1_5 (c1) â†’ need to get it to an airport in c1 (l1_1). So use a truck in c1. The truck t1 is in l1_4. So first, drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_5, load p1 into t1, drive t1 to l1_1, unload p1. Then load p1 into airplane a1, fly a1 to l2_1 (c2's airport). Then, in c2, use truck t2 (which is in l2_5) to transport p1 to l2_3. Wait, but t2 is in l2_5. So drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (airport), load p1 into t2, drive to l2_3, unload.

For p2: starts in l2_2 (c2). Need to get to l1_4 (c1). So, take p2 from l2_2 to airport l2_1 via truck t2 (but t2 is in l2_5 initially). Wait, wait: initial locations are t1 in l1_4, t2 in l2_5. So to get p2 from l2_2 to l2_1, we need a truck in c2. But t2 is in l2_5. So drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2, load p2, drive to l2_1, unload. Then load p2 onto airplane a2, fly to l1_1 (c1's airport), unload into a1? Wait, airplanes can fly between airports. So fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1. Then in c1, use truck t1 to transport p2 to l1_4.

But wait, initial positions: a1 is in l1_1 (c1), a2 in l2_1 (c2). So to move p2 from c2 to c1, perhaps use a2 to fly to l1_1. Wait, but airplanes can fly between any airports? The action flyairplane allows flying from l_from to l_to, which are airports. So l1_1 and l2_1 are airports. So yes, a2 can fly from l2_1 to l1_1, bringing p2.

But let's outline possible steps:

For p1:

1. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_5 (c1).
2. Load p1 into t1 at l1_5.
3. Drive t1 to l1_1 (airport).
4. Unload p1 at l1_1.
5. Load p1 into a1.
6. Fly a1 to l2_1 (c2's airport).
7. Unload p1 from a1 into l2_1.
8. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (since t2 is in l2_5 initially).
9. Load p1 into t2 at l2_1.
10. Drive t2 to l2_3.
11. Unload p1 at l2_3.

For p2:

But we need to interleave steps for p2 as well, considering constraints.

But wait, let's see. The constraints require that:

- At some state, p2 is in l2_1. And when that happens, there must be an earlier state where p1 is in l2_1 or p2 is in l1_1.

Wait, in the p1 steps above, after step 7, p1 is in l2_1. So if we have p2 loaded into a2 and flown to l1_1, which would require p2 to be in l2_1 at some point. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe we can use a2 to carry p2. Let's see.

p2 starts in l2_2 (c2). To get it to l1_4 (c1):

a. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2 (c2). Load p2 into t2. Then drive t2 to l2_1 (airport). Unload p2. Load p2 into a2. Fly a2 to l1_1. Then in c1, use t1 to take p2 from l1_1 to l1_4.

But during this process, when p2 is in l2_1 (after unloading from t2), that's when the first constraint comes into play: that p2 is in l2_1 at some state, and before that, either p1 is in l2_1 or p2 is in l1_1. But in this case, p2 is in l2_1 after being transported by t2. At that point, has p1 been in l2_1 yet? If we do the p2 steps before the p1 steps, then p1 hasn't been there yet. So we need to ensure that when p2 is in l2_1, there's an earlier state where either p1 is in l2_1 or p2 is in l1_1.

But if we first move p1 to l2_1 (as in step 7 above), then when p2 is loaded into a2 and flown to l1_1, p2 would have to be in l2_1 during the loading. So maybe the steps for p2 would involve moving it to l2_1, which would require that either p1 was in l2_1 before, or p2 was in l1_1 before. Wait, but if p2 is being moved to l2_1, then how could it have been in l1_1 before that? That would require moving it to l1_1 first, which might not be possible. So perhaps the way to satisfy this constraint is to first have p1 in l2_1, and then have p2 in l2_1. So in the p1 steps, after step 7, p1 is in l2_1. Then when p2 is moved to l2_1 (during its own transport), the constraint is satisfied because p1 was there earlier.

So, the order would be: first handle p1's steps up to step 7 (p1 in l2_1), then handle p2's steps.

But let's check the constraints step by step.

Constraints:

1. p2 must be in l2_1 at some state. So during p2's transport, when it's at l2_1 (after being driven by t2 and before being loaded into a2), that's the state. Then the condition for this constraint is that before that, either p1 was in l2_1 or p2 was in l1_1. If p1 was in l2_1 before p2 arrives there, then the condition is satisfied. So if we first move p1 to l2_1 (step 7), then when p2 is moved to l2_1 (say, after that), then the condition is met.

So the plan would need to have p1 arrive at l2_1 (step 7) before p2 is moved to l2_1. Then, when p2 is loaded into a2 at l2_1, that's after p1 was there.

Another constraint is that p1 must be in l1_1 at some state. That's covered in step 4 (unload p1 at l1_1). Then, if p1 is in l1_1 in state s, then p2 must be in l1_1 at s or after. So when p1 is unloaded at l1_1 (step 4), we need to ensure that p2 is in l1_1 at some point after that. So when we fly p2 to l1_1 via a2, that would satisfy this.

Another constraint is that p2 must be in a1 at some state. So a1 is the airplane in l1_1. So perhaps we need to load p2 into a1. Wait, but a1 is in l1_1. If p2 is flown to l1_1 via a2, then we unload p2 into l1_1. Then, maybe we load p2 into a1 (but why?), then unload again. That might complicate things, but it's necessary for the constraint. Alternatively, perhaps when we unload p2 from a2 into l1_1, and then load it into a1 (even if it's just for a moment), then unload again. But that would require extra steps. Let's think: after p2 is in l1_1 (unloaded from a2), then we can load it into a1 (since a1 is in l1_1), then unload it again. That would make p2 be in a1, satisfying the constraint. So steps would be: unload p2 from a2 into l1_1, then loadtruck into t1 (but wait, t1 is at l1_1 after step 3). Wait, t1 was driven to l1_1 in step 3, and after unloading p1 (step 4), it's still in l1_1. So after unloading p1, t1 is in l1_1. Then, when p2 arrives at l1_1 via a2, we can load p2 into t1 (but need to drive t1 somewhere else?), but perhaps after that. Wait, no. Let's outline:

For p2:

a. Drive t2 (in l2_5) to l2_2, load p2 into t2.
b. Drive t2 to l2_1, unload p2 into l2_1.
c. Load p2 into a2.
d. Fly a2 to l1_1.
e. Unload p2 into l1_1.
f. Load p2 into a1 (since a1 is in l1_1).
g. Unload p2 into l1_1 again.
h. Then use t1 (in l1_1) to drive p2 to l1_4.

But step f and g would add steps. However, the constraint requires that p2 must be in a1 at some state. So steps f and g would satisfy that. Also, during step e, p2 is in l1_1, which would satisfy the constraint that when p1 was in l1_1 (step 4), then p2 must be in l1_1 at s or after. So step e (after step 4) meets that.

Another constraint is that p2 must be in l1_4 (goal) and when that's true, there must be an earlier state where p1 is in l2_2. So when p2 is finally in l1_4, we need to have had p1 in l2_2 before. But in our current plan for p1, p1 is moved from l2_1 to l2_3 via t2. So after p1 is unloaded at l2_1 (step 7), then we load it into t2 (step 8, drive to l2_3). So during step 8, t2 is driven from l2_5 to l2_1 (step 8?), wait, no: initial steps for p1 were:

7. Unload p1 from a1 into l2_1.

Then, to get p1 to l2_3, we need t2 to be in l2_1. But t2 starts in l2_5. So step 8 is drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1. Then load p1 into t2 (step 9), drive to l2_3 (step 10), unload (step 11). So during step 10, p1 is in t2 while moving to l2_3. But the constraint requires that when p2 is in l1_4, there's an earlier state where p1 is in l2_2. Hmm. So where does p1 go through l2_2? In our current plan, p1 is transported from l2_1 to l2_3 via t2. So if the drive from l2_1 to l2_3 passes through l2_2? Wait, the drivetruck action allows moving directly between any two locations in the same city. So l2_1 to l2_3 would be a direct drive, assuming l2_1 and l2_3 are connected. But the city c2's locations are l2_1 (airport), l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5. So the truck can drive from l2_1 to l2_2, then to l2_3. Or can it drive directly from l2_1 to l2_3? The problem states that trucks can move between locations in the same city. The drivetruck action requires that l_from and l_to are in city c. So the truck can move from any location in the city to another in one step. So if we drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_3 directly, then p1 never is in l2_2. But the constraint says that when p2 is in l1_4, there must have been a state where p1 was in l2_2. So we need to make sure that p1 is in l2_2 at some point before p2 is in l1_4. How?

Maybe adjust the p1's path: instead of driving directly from l2_1 to l2_3, first drive to l2_2, unload p1 there (but that's not the goal), then drive to l2_3. But that would add steps. Alternatively, after unloading p1 at l2_1, load it into t2, drive to l2_2, unload (so p1 is in l2_2), then drive to l2_3 and unload. But that would make the plan longer. But since the constraint requires that p1 is in l2_2 at some state before p2 is in l1_4, we have to do that. So steps for p1:

7. Unload p1 into l2_1.

8. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (if not already there).

9. Load p1 into t2 at l2_1.

10. Drive t2 to l2_2.

11. Unload p1 into l2_2.

12. Load p1 into t2 again.

13. Drive t2 to l2_3.

14. Unload p1 into l2_3.

This way, p1 is in l2_2 (step 11) before p2 is in l1_4. Then, when p2 is finally unloaded in l1_4 (the goal), the constraint is satisfied because p1 was in l2_2 earlier.

This adds steps but is necessary.

So integrating this into the plan would require that.

Now, considering all the constraints, let's check each one:

1. p2 must be in l2_1 at some state. This happens when p2 is unloaded from t2 into l2_1 during its transport to the airport. Then, the condition is that before this, either p1 is in l2_1 or p2 is in l1_1. Since p1 arrives in l2_1 (step 7) before p2 is moved to l2_1 (assuming the order is p1 first, then p2), then the condition is satisfied.

2. p1 must be in l1_1 (step 4). Then, after that, p2 must be in l1_1. That happens when p2 is unloaded from a2 into l1_1 (step e in p2's plan).

3. At some state, p2 is in a1 or l1_3. To satisfy this, we need p2 to be in a1. So after unloading p2 from a2 into l1_1 (step e), we can load it into a1 (step f), which would satisfy this constraint.

4. The goal requires p2 in l1_4, so that's covered.

5. When p2 is in l1_4, there's an earlier state where p1 is in l2_2. This is achieved by step 11 in p1's plan.

6. p2 must be in a1 (step f).

7. p2 must be in l2_5 or l1_2. Initially, p2 is in l2_2. So to get to l2_5, we would have to move it there. But that's not part of the goal. However, the initial state says that t2 is in l2_5, but p2 is in l2_2. Wait, no. The original state says "Package t1 is in location l1_4", "Package t2 is in location l2_5". Wait, that's a typo? Because t1 and t2 are trucks, not packages. Wait, looking back:

The original state says:

"Package t1 is in location l1_4"

"Package t2 is in location l2_5"

But trucks are t1 and t2. Wait, that's a mistake. Because in the objects, we have:

"truck t1"

"truck t2"

"package p1"

"package p2"

So the original state entries probably have a typo. The correct original state should be:

"Truck t1 is in location l1_4"

"Truck t2 is in location l2_5"

But the user wrote "Package t1" and "Package t2" instead of "Truck t1". That's a mistake. But according to the problem statement, that's what's given. Wait, but the problem statement says:

"The original state of the world is the following:

...

"Package t1 is in location l1_4"

"Package t2 is in location l2_5"

..."

Wait, that's impossible. Because t1 and t2 are trucks, not packages. So this is likely an error in the problem statement. Assuming that this is a typo, and the correct entries are:

"Truck t1 is in location l1_4"

"Truck t2 is in location l2_5"

Because otherwise, there's a contradiction since t1 and t2 are trucks, not packages. So I'll proceed under that assumption.

So t1 is in l1_4 (c1), t2 in l2_5 (c2). That makes sense.

So for p2's initial location: l2_2 (c2). So to move p2, we need to use truck t2 (in l2_5). So first, drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2 (same city), load p2, drive to l2_1 (airport), unload, load into a2, fly to l1_1, unload, then load into a1, then unload again, then load into t1 and drive to l1_4.

But wait, after step e (unloading p2 into l1_1), we need to load p2 into a1 (step f) to satisfy the constraint that p2 is in a1. Then, unload into l1_1 again (step g). Then, load into t1 (which is in l1_1) and drive to l1_4.

But let's proceed step by step.

Now, let's also check the other constraints:

8. p2 must be in a1 (step f).

9. p2 must be in l2_5 or l1_2. Since initially, p2 is in l2_2. To get to l2_5, we would have to drive it there. But in the current plan, p2 is moved from l2_2 to l2_1. So how can p2 be in l2_5 or l1_2? Well, initially, p2 is in l2_2, so it's not in l2_5. But the constraint requires that at some state, p2 is in l2_5 or l1_2. So we need to have p2 in one of those locations. Since in our current plan, p2 is moved from l2_2 to l2_1, then to l1_1, etc. It never goes to l2_5 or l1_2. So this is a problem. So we need to adjust the plan to have p2 in either l2_5 or l1_2 at some point.

Hmm. How can we do that? Perhaps during the transportation of p2, we can take a detour. For example, after loading p2 into t2 (at l2_2), drive t2 to l2_5 (to satisfy the constraint), then drive back to l2_1. But that would add steps. Let's see:

For p2:

a. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2 (load p2).

b. Drive t2 to l2_5 (to get p2 into l2_5, satisfying constraint 9).

c. Unload p2 into l2_5 (but that's where t2 was initially). Then reload p2 into t2, drive to l2_1.

But that adds steps. However, constraint 9 requires that p2 is in l2_5 or l1_2 at some state. So if we can get p2 into l2_5, that would satisfy it. Alternatively, take p2 to l1_2. But l1_2 is in c1. To get p2 to l1_2, we need to transport it to c1 first. So maybe after p2 is in l1_1 (after being flown there), drive t1 to l1_2, unload there. But that would also add steps. But which is shorter?

Option 1: Detour p2 to l2_5.

So steps for p2:

1. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2 (c2).

2. Load p2 into t2 at l2_2.

3. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_5 (so p2 is in l2_5 when unloaded).

4. Unload p2 into l2_5.

5. Load p2 into t2 again.

6. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1.

7. Unload p2 into l2_1.

8. Load p2 into a2.

9. Fly a2 to l1_1.

10. Unload p2 into l1_1.

11. Load p2 into a1 (satisfies constraint 6).

12. Unload p2 into l1_1.

13. Load p2 into t1.

14. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_4.

15. Unload p2 into l1_4.

This way, step 4 unloads p2 into l2_5, satisfying constraint 9. But this adds several steps. However, the problem requires an optimal plan (shortest possible). So adding steps might not be optimal. Alternatively, can we have p2 in l1_2?

After p2 is in l1_1 (step 10), we can drive t1 to l1_2, unload p2 there, then load again and drive to l1_4. That would make p2 be in l1_2, satisfying constraint 9. Let's see:

Steps after step 10 (p2 in l1_1):

11. Load p2 into t1.

12. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_2.

13. Unload p2 into l1_2 (satisfies constraint 9).

14. Load p2 into t1 again.

15. Drive t1 to l1_4.

16. Unload p2 into l1_4.

But this also adds steps. So which approach is shorter?

Original plan (without detours) for p2:

Steps:

For p2:

1. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2. (1 step)

2. Load p2. (2)

3. Drive t2 to l2_1. (3)

4. Unload p2. (4)

5. Load into a2. (5)

6. Fly a2 to l1_1. (6)

7. Unload p2. (7)

8. Load into a1. (8)

9. Unload p2. (9)

10. Load into t1. (10)

11. Drive to l1_4. (11)

12. Unload. (12)

But the detour to l1_2 adds steps 11-14 as above, making total steps for p2: 12 (original) +4 = 16? No, wait, in the alternative, steps after step 7 (unload into l1_1):

8. Load into t1 (step 8)

9. Drive to l1_2 (step9)

10. Unload (step10, satisfies constraint 9)

11. Load into t1 again (step11)

12. Drive to l1_4 (step12)

13. Unload (step13)

So that's 7 steps for p2 up to unloading in l1_1, then 6 more steps (steps 8-13), totaling 13 steps for p2. While the detour to l2_5 adds steps 3-7 (drive to l2_5, unload, load, drive to l2_1, etc.), which is 4 additional steps, making p2's steps 11 (original) +4=15 steps.

But the problem requires an optimal plan. So which path is shorter?

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to satisfy the constraints without adding steps. Let's re-examine the constraints:

Constraint 9: p2 must be in l2_5 or l1_2 at some state.

Initially, p2 is in l2_2. If during transportation, we can pass through l2_5 or l1_2. But in the initial plan for p2, after being loaded into t2 (l2_2), driven to l2_1, then no. But if we drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2, then to l2_1, then p2 is only in l2_2 and l2_1. So no.

Alternatively, after p2 is in l1_1, maybe we can drive it to l1_2. So after unloading p2 into l1_1 (step e), then drive t1 (which is in l1_1) to l1_2, unload p2 there, then drive to l1_4. But this adds two steps (drive to l1_2 and unload, then reload and drive to l1_4). But this would satisfy constraint 9 (p2 in l1_2).

But then, also, another constraint is that p2 must be in l1_5 at some state. Wait, constraint 10: p2 must be in l1_5. Oh right, I almost forgot. So the constraints are:

- p2 must be in l1_4 (goal)

- p2 must be in l2_1 (constraint 1)

- p2 must be in a1 (constraint 6)

- p2 must be in l2_5 or l1_2 (constraint 9)

- p2 must be in l1_5 (constraint 10)

So this is another problem. So even if we handle constraint 9 by going to l1_2, we still need to have p2 in l1_5 at some state. And l1_5 is in c1. So how to achieve that?

So after p2 is in l1_1, we need to take it to l1_5, then to l1_4. But that adds even more steps. Alternatively, perhaps during transportation, after unloading p2 into l1_1, load into t1, drive to l1_5, unload (satisfies constraint 10), then load again and drive to l1_4.

But this adds even more steps. This is getting complicated. Let's outline all the constraints and see which steps can satisfy multiple constraints.

Let's list all constraints that require p2 to be in certain places:

- Must be in l2_1 (constraint 1)

- Must be in l1_1 (as per constraint 2's implication when p1 is there)

- Must be in a1 (constraint 6)

- Must be in l2_5 or l1_2 (constraint 9)

- Must be in l1_4 (goal)

- Must be in l1_5 (constraint 10)

Additionally, when p2 is in l1_4, there must be an earlier state where p1 is in l2_2.

Also, another constraint: "At least one of the following conditions is true: p2 is in a1 or l1_3" (constraint 3). So p2 needs to be in a1 (which is handled by loading into a1) or in l1_3. But l1_3 is in c1, so if we can get p2 to l1_3, that would also satisfy it. But since we already have to load into a1, maybe that's the easier way.

But given all these constraints, the plan is getting very long, which contradicts the need for an optimal (shortest) plan. So perhaps there's a smarter way to route the packages to satisfy multiple constraints with fewer steps.

Alternative approach:

Let's try to find a way to satisfy multiple constraints with the same step.

For example:

- When p2 is loaded into a1 (to satisfy constraint 6), that also puts p2 in l1_1 (since a1 is there). Which helps with constraint 2 (if p1 was in l1_1, then p2 must be in l1_1 after that).

But p1 is in l1_1 during step 4 (unload p1 there). Then, when p2 arrives in l1_1 (via a2), and then is loaded into a1 (still in l1_1), this satisfies the requirement that after p1 is in l1_1, p2 is in l1_1 at some point.

Now, the constraint that p2 must be in l1_5: perhaps after being in l1_1, drive t1 to l1_5, unload p2 there (satisfying constraint 10), then reload and drive to l1_4.

But that adds steps. However, maybe we can combine this with the step where p1 is moved. Wait, p1 starts in l1_5. So when t1 is driven to l1_5 to pick up p1 (step 1), after unloading p1 into l1_1, t1 is in l1_1. Then, after p2 is unloaded into l1_1, load p2 into t1, drive to l1_5 (satisfying constraint 10), unload, then drive to l1_4.

So steps for p2:

After arriving in l1_1 via a2:

1. Load p2 into t1.

2. Drive t1 to l1_5.

3. Unload p2 (now in l1_5, constraint 10).

4. Load p2 into t1 again.

5. Drive to l1_4.

6. Unload (goal).

This adds four steps but satisfies constraint 10.

Also, during this, when p2 is in l1_5 (step 3), that satisfies constraint 10.

So integrating all these steps:

Plan for p1:

1. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_5 (c1).

2. Load p1 into t1.

3. Drive t1 to l1_1.

4. Unload p1 into l1_1.

5. Load p1 into a1.

6. Fly a1 to l2_1 (c2's airport).

7. Unload p1 into l2_1.

8. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1.

9. Load p1 into t2.

10. Drive t2 to l2_2.

11. Unload p1 into l2_2.

12. Load p1 into t2.

13. Drive t2 to l2_3.

14. Unload p1 into l2_3 (goal).

Plan for p2:

A. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2 (but wait, t2 is in l2_5 initially. After step 8, t2 is driven to l2_1. But in p1's plan, step 8 is drive t2 to l2_1. So after step 8, t2 is in l2_1. So for p2's transport, we need to use t2 before it's moved for p1's transport. So this is conflicting.

Ah, here's a problem. The truck t2 is used for both p1 and p2. But in the initial plan, t2 is used to move p1 from l2_1 to l2_3. But for p2, we need to move it from l2_2 to l2_1 using t2. So the steps must be ordered such that t2 is driven to l2_2 first to pick up p2, then to l2_1, then used for p1.

But this complicates the timeline. Let's re-express the entire plan with proper ordering.

Let me try to outline the entire sequence step by step, considering the use of trucks and airplanes.

First, handle p2's initial steps:

1. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2 (c2) to pick up p2.

2. Load p2 into t2 at l2_2.

3. Drive t2 to l2_1 (c2's airport).

4. Unload p2 into l2_1.

5. Load p2 into a2.

6. Fly a2 to l1_1 (c1's airport).

7. Unload p2 into l1_1.

At this point, p2 is in l1_1. Now, we need to get it to l1_4.

But before that, we need to satisfy the other constraints.

Now, for p1's steps:

8. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_5 (c1).

9. Load p1 into t1.

10. Drive t1 to l1_1.

11. Unload p1 into l1_1.

12. Load p1 into a1.

13. Fly a1 to l2_1.

14. Unload p1 into l2_1.

15. Drive t2 (which is in l2_1 after step 3) to l2_2.

16. Load p1 into t2.

17. Drive t2 to l2_3.

18. Unload p1 into l2_3 (goal).

Wait, but in step 3, t2 was driven to l2_1. Then in step 15, drive t2 to l2_2 again. So after step 3, t2 is in l2_1. Then after unloading p2 into l2_1 (step 4), t2 is still in l2_1. So steps 15-18 are for p1.

But this would require that after moving p2 to l2_1, we use t2 to move p1 from l2_1 to l2_3. But during this time, p1 is in l2_1 (step 14).

Now, let's check the constraints:

- p2 must be in l2_1 (step 4). Before that, either p1 is in l2_1 or p2 is in l1_1. But p1 is moved to l2_1 in step 14, which is after p2 is in l2_1 (step 4). So this violates the constraint, because when p2 is in l2_1 (step 4), there must have been an earlier state where p1 was in l2_1 or p2 was in l1_1. But at step 4, p1 hasn't been moved to l2_1 yet. So this is a problem.

Thus, the order of steps is incorrect. We need to ensure that before p2 is in l2_1, either p1 is in l2_1 or p2 is in l1_1. But in this current sequence, p2 is in l2_1 (step 4) before p1 is moved to l2_1 (step 14). So to satisfy the constraint, either:

a. p2 is in l1_1 before step 4, which is not possible since p2 is being moved from c2 to c1, arriving in l1_1 at step 7.

b. p1 is in l2_1 before step 4. But p1's steps to l2_1 happen after p2's steps. So this is conflicting.

This indicates that the order of moving p1 and p2 must be adjusted. Perhaps p1 must be moved to l2_1 before p2 is moved to l2_1.

So let's reorder the steps:

First, move p1 to l2_1, then move p2 to l2_1.

But how?

p1 is in l1_5 (c1). To move p1 to l2_1:

1. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_5.

2. Load p1 into t1.

3. Drive t1 to l1_1.

4. Unload p1 into l1_1.

5. Load p1 into a1.

6. Fly a1 to l2_1.

7. Unload p1 into l2_1.

Now, p1 is in l2_1 (step 7).

Then, for p2:

8. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2.

9. Load p2 into t2.

10. Drive t2 to l2_1.

11. Unload p2 into l2_1.

Now, when p2 is unloaded into l2_1 (step 11), the earlier state where p1 was in l2_1 is step 7, which satisfies constraint 1.

Then, load p2 into a2, fly to l1_1, etc.

But this way, p2's transport happens after p1's.

But this would mean that p1's steps are done first, then p2's.

Now, let's integrate all steps:

Plan for p1:

1. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_5.

2. Load p1 into t1.

3. Drive t1 to l1_1.

4. Unload p1 into l1_1.

5. Load p1 into a1.

6. Fly a1 to l2_1.

7. Unload p1 into l2_1.

8. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1.

9. Load p1 into t2.

10. Drive t2 to l2_2.

11. Unload p1 into l2_2.

12. Load p1 into t2.

13. Drive t2 to l2_3.

14. Unload p1 into l2_3 (goal).

Plan for p2:

15. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1. (Wait, t2 was used for p1 and is now in l2_3. But after step 14, t2 is in l2_3. To move p2, we need to use t2 again. But this is impossible because t2 is in c2's l2_3, and p2 is in c2's l2_2. So this approach is not feasible.)

Ah, this is a problem. After step 14, t2 is in l2_3. To move p2 from l2_2 to l2_1, we need t2 to be available. But after moving p1, t2 is in l2_3. So we need to drive t2 back to l2_5, then to l2_2, etc. This complicates the plan.

Alternative approach: Use different trucks for p1 and p2. But in c2, there's only t2. So we have to use t2 for both packages. So the steps must be ordered such that after moving p1, t2 is available to move p2.

But in the current plan, after step 14, t2 is in l2_3. So to move p2, we need to drive t2 back to l2_5, then to l2_2, etc. But this adds steps.

Alternatively, perhaps move p2 first. Let's try that.

Plan for p2:

1. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2.

2. Load p2 into t2.

3. Drive t2 to l2_1.

4. Unload p2 into l2_1.

5. Load p2 into a2.

6. Fly a2 to l1_1.

7. Unload p2 into l1_1.

At this point, p2 is in l1_1. Now, to satisfy the constraint that when p1 is in l1_1 (which happens later), p2 must be in l1_1 after that. But if p2 is already there before p1 arrives, that's okay? Because the constraint says if p1 is in l1_1 in some state s, then p2 must be in l1_1 at s or after. So if p2 is in l1_1 before p1 arrives there, that's not satisfying the constraint, because when p1 is in l1_1, p2 must be there at the same time or after. So this order is a problem.

Thus, the correct order must be:

p1 is moved to l1_1 first, then p2 arrives there later. So p1's steps to l1_1 must come before p2's steps to l1_1.

This complicates the ordering.

Let's try again:

Plan for p1:

1. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_5.

2. Load p1 into t1.

3. Drive t1 to l1_1.

4. Unload p1 into l1_1.

5. Load p1 into a1.

6. Fly a1 to l2_1.

7. Unload p1 into l2_1.

8. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1.

9. Load p1 into t2.

10. Drive t2 to l2_2.

11. Unload p1 into l2_2.

12. Load p1 into t2.

13. Drive t2 to l2_3.

14. Unload p1 into l2_3.

Now, for p2:

15. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_5.

16. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2.

17. Load p2 into t2.

18. Drive t2 to l2_1.

19. Unload p2 into l2_1.

20. Load p2 into a2.

21. Fly a2 to l1_1.

22. Unload p2 into l1_1.

23. Load p2 into a1.

24. Unload p2 into l1_1.

25. Load p2 into t1.

26. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_5.

27. Unload p2 into l1_5.

28. Load p2 into t1.

29. Drive t1 to l1_4.

30. Unload p2 into l1_4.

This way, all constraints are satisfied:

- p2 is in l2_1 (step 19). Before that, p1 was in l2_1 (step 7), satisfying constraint 1.

- p1 is in l1_1 (step 4). Then p2 is in l1_1 (step 22), satisfying constraint 2.

- p2 is in a1 (step 23-24), satisfying constraint 6.

- p2 is in l2_5 (step 15? No, in step 15, t2 is driven to l2_5 but p2 is not there yet. Oops, no. In step 15, t2 is driven from l2_3 to l2_5, but p2 is not in t2. Because p1 was in t2 up to step 14. So after step 14, t2 is empty in l2_3. Then in step 15, drive t2 to l2_5 (empty). Step 16, drive to l2_2 (empty), then load p2. So p2 is in l2_2 initially. So steps 15-17: drive t2 to l2_5, then to l2_2, load p2. But during that time, p2 is in l2_2 (initial location). So when t2 is driven to l2_2 and loaded, p2 is picked up. So during step 17, p2 is loaded into t2. So after step 17, p2 is in t2. Then driven to l2_1 (step 18), unloaded (step 19). So p2 is in l2_1 at step 19.

But to satisfy constraint 9 (p2 in l2_5 or l1_2), during step 15-16, when t2 is driven to l2_5 and l2_2, but p2 is not in t2 until step 17. So p2 is only in l2_2 and l2_1, not in l2_5. So this doesn't satisfy constraint 9. Hmm.

Alternative approach for constraint 9: After p2 is unloaded into l1_1 (step 22), load it into t1 (step 25), drive to l1_2 (step 26), unload (step 27). Then drive to l1_5, etc. This way, p2 is in l1_2 (step 27), satisfying constraint 9.

So adjusting steps:

22. Unload p2 into l1_1.

23. Load p2 into a1.

24. Unload p2 into l1_1.

25. Load p2 into t1.

26. Drive t1 to l1_2.

27. Unload p2 into l1_2.

28. Load p2 into t1.

29. Drive t1 to l1_5.

30. Unload p2 into l1_5.

31. Load p2 into t1.

32. Drive t1 to l1_4.

33. Unload p2 into l1_4.

This way:

- Step 27: p2 in l1_2 (constraint 9).

- Step 30: p2 in l1_5 (constraint 10).

- Step 23: p2 in a1 (constraint 6).

- Step 19: p2 in l2_1 (constraint 1).

- Step 4: p1 in l1_1, then step 22: p2 in l1_1 (constraint 2).

- Step 14: p1 in l2_3 (goal).

- Step 33: p2 in l1_4 (goal), and before that, step 11: p1 in l2_2 (constraint 5).

This plan satisfies all constraints but is very long. However, the problem requires an optimal (shortest) plan. So perhaps there's a way to reduce steps by combining actions.

Alternative idea: When p2 is in l1_1 (step 22), load it into a1 (step 23) and then unload (step 24) to satisfy being in a1. Then load into t1 (step 25), drive to l1_5 (step 26), unload (step 27: satisfies constraint 10), then drive to l1_4 (step 28) and unload (step 29). This would save some steps.

So steps for p2 after step 22:

23. Load p2 into a1.

24. Unload p2 into l1_1. (Now p2 is in l1_1 again, but has been in a1, satisfying constraint 6.)

25. Load p2 into t1.

26. Drive t1 to l1_5.

27. Unload p2 into l1_5. (constraint 10)

28. Load p2 into t1.

29. Drive t1 to l1_4.

30. Unload p2 into l1_4.

This way, steps 23-30 for p2, which is 8 steps. But combining this with earlier steps, the total plan becomes very long. However, given the numerous constraints, it's challenging to find a shorter plan.

Another optimization: After step 24 (p2 in l1_1), drive t1 to l1_5, unload there (satisfies constraint 10), then drive to l1_4. So:

23. Load p2 into t1.

24. Drive t1 to l1_5.

25. Unload p2 into l1_5. (constraint 10)

26. Load p2 into t1.

27. Drive t1 to l1_4.

28. Unload p2 into l1_4.

This skips the a1 loading, but then constraint 6 (p2 in a1) is not satisfied. So we need to include loading into a1.

Thus, the steps must include loading into a1.

Alternative approach: When p2 is in l1_1 (step 22), load into a1 (step 23), then unload into l1_1 (step 24), then drive to l1_5 and l1_4.

This satisfies constraint 6 and 10.

But steps 23-28:

23. Load p2 into a1. (Now p2 is in a1, satisfying constraint 6)

24. Unload p2 into l1_1. 

25. Load p2 into t1.

26. Drive t1 to l1_5.

27. Unload p2 into l1_5. (constraint 10)

28. Load p2 into t1.

29. Drive t1 to l1_4.

30. Unload p2 into l1_4.

So steps 23-30 are necessary for p2.

Overall, this seems to be the minimal steps required to meet all constraints. Now, integrating everything:

Final Plan Steps:

For p1:

1. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_5.

2. Load p1 into t1.

3. Drive t1 to l1_1.

4. Unload p1 into l1_1.

5. Load p1 into a1.

6. Fly a1 to l2_1.

7. Unload p1 into l2_1.

8. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1.

9. Load p1 into t2.

10. Drive t2 to l2_2.

11. Unload p1 into l2_2.

12. Load p1 into t2.

13. Drive t2 to l2_3.

14. Unload p1 into l2_3.

For p2:

15. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_5.

16. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2.

17. Load p2 into t2.

18. Drive t2 to l2_1.

19. Unload p2 into l2_1.

20. Load p2 into a2.

21. Fly a2 to l1_1.

22. Unload p2 into l1_1.

23. Load p2 into a1.

24. Unload p2 into l1_1.

25. Load p2 into t1.

26. Drive t1 to l1_5.

27. Unload p2 into l1_5.

28. Load p2 into t1.

29. Drive t1 to l1_4.

30. Unload p2 into l1_4.

This plan has 30 steps. However, it's possible that some steps can be optimized. For example, after step 14, t2 is in l2_3. To move p2, we need to get t2 back to l2_2. Instead of driving to l2_5 and then to l2_2, perhaps drive directly from l2_3 to l2_2 (since they're in the same city). So steps 15 and 16 can be replaced with:

15. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_2.

This saves two steps (steps 15 and 16 become one step).

Similarly, other steps may be optimized. Let's re-express the plan with these optimizations.

Optimized Plan:

For p1:

1. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_5. (c1)

2. Loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5.

3. Drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1.

4. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1.

5. Loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1.

6. Flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1.

7. Unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1.

8. Drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2. (Initially, t2 is in l2_5.)

9. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1.

10. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2.

11. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2.

12. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2.

13. Drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2.

14. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3.

For p2:

15. Drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2. (After step 14, t2 is in l2_3.)

16. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2. (p2 is initially in l2_2.)

17. Drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2.

18. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.

19. Loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1.

20. Flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

21. Unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1.

22. Loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1.

23. Unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1.

24. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1. (t1 is in l1_1 after step 3.)

25. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1.

26. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5.

27. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5.

28. Drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1.

29. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4.

This plan has 29 steps. But let's check for possible optimizations:

- Step 15: t2 is driven from l2_3 to l2_2 to pick up p2. Since p2 is in l2_2, once t2 is there, they can be loaded.

- Steps 16-18: load and drive to l2_1.

- Steps 19-21: fly to l1_1.

- Steps 22-23: load into a1 and unload to satisfy constraint 6.

- Steps 24-29: move p2 to l1_5 and then to l1_4.

But wait, in step 16, p2 is in l2_2. The constraint 9 requires p2 to be in l2_5 or l1_2 at some state. In this plan, p2 is never in l2_5 or l1_2. So this violates constraint 9.

Ah, so this is a problem. We need to find a way to have p2 in either l2_5 or l1_2.

In the current plan, p2 is loaded from l2_2 into t2 and driven to l2_1. So p2 is in l2_2 (step 16) when loaded, but that's its initial position, which doesn't count. So we need to move p2 to l2_5 or l1_2.

To satisfy constraint 9, perhaps during p2's transportation, we can make a detour. For example:

After step 18 (p2 in l2_1), before flying to l1_1, drive t2 to l2_5, unload p2 there (satisfying constraint 9), then reload and proceed.

So adjusting steps:

18. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.

19. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.

20. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2.

21. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5. (constraint 9)

22. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5.

23. Drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2.

24. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.

25. Loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1.

26. Flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

27. Unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1.

28. Loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1.

29. Unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1.

30. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

31. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1.

32. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5.

33. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5.

34. Drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1.

35. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4.

This adds steps 19-24, making the plan even longer.

Alternatively, after step 17 (driving t2 to l2_1 with p2), instead of unloading, drive to l2_5, unload there (satisfies constraint 9), then drive back to l2_1.

So:

For p2:

15. Drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2.

16. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2.

17. Drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2.

18. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5. (constraint 9)

19. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5.

20. Drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2.

21. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.

22. Loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1.

23. Flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

24. Unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1.

25. Loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1.

26. Unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1.

27. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

28. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1.

29. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5. (constraint 10)

30. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5.

31. Drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1.

32. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4.

This adds steps but satisfies constraint 9. However, this makes the plan even longer.

Given the complexity and the number of constraints, it's challenging to find a shorter plan. The optimal plan likely has to include all these steps to satisfy each constraint.

But perhaps there's a smarter way. Let's think differently: maybe p2 can be in l1_3 to satisfy constraint 3 (p2 in a1 or l1_3). If we can route p2 through l1_3 instead of a1, but that would require additional steps. But since we already need to load into a1 for constraint 6, it's better to satisfy both constraints 3 and 6 with the same action.

Another observation: The constraint that p2 must be in l1_4 (goal) and when that's true, p1 must have been in l2_2 before. In our plan, p1 is in l2_2 (step 11), which is before p2 arrives in l1_4 (step 32). So that's satisfied.

Similarly, the constraint that p2 must be in a1 (step 25-26) and in l1_5 (step 29).

Another constraint: p2 must be in l1_5 at some state (step 29).

Another constraint: when p2 is in l1_4 (step 32), there must be an earlier state where p1 is in l2_2 (step 11).

So all constraints are satisfied.

But this plan has 32 steps, which seems too long. The problem states that the optimal plan must be of minimal length. So there must be a shorter way.

Alternative idea: Use airplanes to carry both packages.

For example, after p1 is in l2_1 (step 7), maybe a2 can carry both p1 and p2. But airplanes can only carry packages if they are loaded.

Alternatively, find overlapping steps where actions satisfy multiple constraints.

For example, when p2 is in l1_1, and then loaded into a1, which satisfies both being in a1 and in l1_1.

But I think given the constraints, the minimal plan must include all these steps. Therefore, the final answer is as follows, but I'm not sure if it's optimal. However, due to time constraints, I'll provide the plan with the steps outlined, ensuring all constraints are met.
