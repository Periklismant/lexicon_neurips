Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. Hmm, the goal is to get p1 to l2_5 and p2 to l1_3. But there are a bunch of constraints to satisfy along the way. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the initial state. Packages: p1 is at l2_1 (which is an airport in c2), p2 is at l1_2 (in c1). Trucks: t1 is at l1_3 (c1), t2 at l2_5 (c2). Airplanes: a1 is at l1_1 (c1's airport), a2 at l2_1 (c2's airport).

Constraints to satisfy:

1. p2 must be in l1_2 at some state. But initially, p2 is already there. So maybe that's already satisfied? But wait, the problem says the constraints must hold in the plan. So maybe we need to ensure that even though it starts there, we might move it and then bring it back? Or perhaps since the initial state is before any actions, does that count? The problem says "at least one state", so the initial state counts. So maybe that's already covered. But need to check if any constraints require changes after that.

Wait, the second constraint: if p2 is in l1_2 in some state s, then p2 must be in l2_3 at s or after. Since the initial state has p2 in l1_2, we need to ensure that at some point after, p2 is in l2_3. So that's a key point. So we have to move p2 from l1_2 to l2_3 at some point after the initial state.

Third constraint: p2 must be in l1_4 or l2_2 in some state.

Fourth: p2 must be in l1_3 (the goal), which is required, but also the fourth constraint says it must hold in at least one state. But the goal is to have p2 there, so that's covered.

Fifth: if p2 is in l1_3 (the goal), then there must be an earlier state where p1 is in l2_3. So before p2 arrives at l1_3, p1 must have been in l2_3 at some point.

Sixth: p2 must be in l2_1 at some state.

Seventh: p1 must be in l2_4.

Eighth: p1 must be in l1_5.

Ninth: p1 must be in a1.

Wow, that's a lot. Let's outline what needs to happen.

Starting with p1. It's at l2_1 (c2's airport). To get it to l2_5 (the goal). The constraints also require p1 to be in l2_4, l1_5, and inside a1. So p1 has to move through various locations and maybe be loaded into a1.

But how? Let's see. Since a1 is in l1_1 (c1's airport), to get p1 into a1, we need to transport p1 from c2 to c1. That would require using an airplane. So maybe load p1 into a2 (since a2 is at l2_1, where p1 starts), fly a2 to l1_1, then unload p1 there. Then load into a1, which is in l1_1. But then to get p1 to l1_5, which is in c1. So use truck t1 (which is at l1_3) to drive to l1_1, load p1 into t1, drive to l1_5, unload. Then maybe put it back into a1 or another airplane to send back to c2? But the goal is l2_5, which is in c2, and t2 is there. So after moving p1 around, we need to get it back to c2.

But this seems complicated. Let's think step by step.

First, for p1:

Initial location: l2_1 (c2's airport). The goal is l2_5 (c2, non-airport). So to get there, perhaps use truck t2. t2 is at l2_5. Wait, no: the initial state says "Package t2 is in location l2_5". Wait, wait. Wait the original state says:

Wait, the original state lists "Package t1 is in location l1_3", "Package t2 is in location l2_5". Wait, but t1 and t2 are trucks, right? Because the objects include "truck t1" and "truck t2". So maybe that's a typo in the problem statement. Because packages are p1 and p2. So maybe the original state should say "Truck t1 is in location l1_3", "Truck t2 is in location l2_5". Otherwise, if t1 and t2 are packages, that conflicts with p1 and p2. So probably, the problem statement has a mistake here. Let me check.

In the problem statement under "The original state of the world is the following", there are entries like "Package t1 is in location l1_3". But t1 is a truck. So that must be a mistake. It should be "Truck t1 is in location l1_3". Otherwise, the initial state is invalid because t1 is a truck, not a package. So assuming that's a typo, let's proceed with that.

So correcting that:

Original state:

Truck t1 is in l1_3 (c1)

Truck t2 is in l2_5 (c2)

Airplane a1 is in l1_1 (c1's airport)

Airplane a2 is in l2_1 (c2's airport)

Packages:

p1 is at l2_1 (c2's airport)

p2 is at l1_2 (c1)

So p1 needs to go from l2_1 (c2) to l2_5 (c2). To move within c2, can use truck t2. But t2 is at l2_5. To get to l2_1 (the airport), t2 would need to drive from l2_5 to l2_1. But the cities' locations: c2 has l2_1 (airport), l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5. So l2_5 is a location in c2, and t2 is there. So to get t2 to l2_1, we can drive it through the city. So drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2, then drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2, etc., until reaching l2_1. But that's time-consuming. Alternatively, if there's a faster way.

Wait, but p1 is at l2_1. To load it into t2, t2 needs to be at l2_1. So first, drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 via multiple steps. Then load p1 into t2, drive back to l2_5, unload. But this would satisfy the goal for p1. However, the constraints require p1 to be in l2_4, l1_5, and inside a1. So we need to move p1 through those locations as well.

So how to handle that?

First, maybe we need to move p1 from l2_1 (c2) into a2 (which is at l2_1). Load p1 into a2, then fly a2 to l1_1 (c1's airport). Then unload p1 into l1_1. Then load p1 into a1 (which is at l1_1). Then fly a1 to some other airport, but perhaps l2_1 again? Or maybe unload p1 from a1 into l1_1, then load into truck t1 (which is at l1_3, so need to drive t1 to l1_1?), drive to l1_5, unload. Then maybe load back into a1, fly to c2's airport l2_1, unload, then load into truck t2 which is driven to l2_1, drive to l2_5. But this is getting complicated, but necessary to meet the constraints.

Let's outline steps for p1:

1. Load p1 into a2 at l2_1 (since both are there). Action: loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1.

2. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

3. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1.

Now p1 is at l1_1. Then load into a1:

4. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1.

Now p1 is in a1. This satisfies the ninth constraint (p1 is in a1 in some state).

Then, fly a1 to l2_1 (c2's airport):

5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1.

Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1:

6. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1.

Now p1 is back at l2_1. Then need to move it via truck t2 to l2_5.

But t2 is at l2_5. So need to drive t2 to l2_1 first.

7. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2.

8. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2.

9. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2.

10. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2.

Now t2 is at l2_1. Load p1 into t2:

11. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1.

Then drive t2 back to l2_5:

12. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2.

13. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2.

14. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2.

15. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2.

Unload p1 at l2_5:

16. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5.

This achieves the goal for p1. But along the way, p1 was in a1 (step 4), which satisfies constraint 9. Also, when a1 flew from l1_1 to l2_1, p1 was inside a1. Then, when unloaded at l2_1, that's step 6. But when was p1 in l2_4 and l1_5?

Wait, the constraints require p1 to be in l2_4 (constraint 7) and l1_5 (constraint 8). So our current steps don't cover those. So we need to adjust.

Perhaps after unloading p1 at l1_1 (step 3), before loading into a1, we can move it via truck to l1_5. But for that, we need a truck in l1_1. The trucks in c1 are t1 (at l1_3). So drive t1 to l1_1.

So insert:

After step 3 (p1 at l1_1):

4. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1.

5. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1.

6. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1.

7. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1.

8. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1.

9. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1.

10. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1.

11. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5.

Now p1 is at l1_5, satisfying constraint 8.

Then load p1 back into t1:

12. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5.

Drive back to l1_1:

13. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1.

14. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1.

15. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1.

16. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1.

Unload p1 at l1_1:

17. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1.

Then load into a1 (step 4 from before, now step 18):

18. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1.

Fly to l2_1:

19. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1.

Unload p1:

20. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1.

Now, proceed to move p1 via truck t2 to l2_5, as before.

But this is getting too long. Also, we need to make sure p1 is in l2_4. So perhaps when moving p1 from l2_1 to l2_5 via t2, we can unload it at l2_4.

Wait, after loading p1 into t2 at l2_1 (step 11 in original plan), drive t2 to l2_2, then l2_3, then l2_4. Unload p1 at l2_4 (satisfying constraint 7), then load again and drive to l2_5.

So:

After loading p1 into t2:

11. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1.

12. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2.

13. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2. (But wait, if we unload here, p1 is at l2_2, which is part of the third constraint (p2 in l2_2 or l1_4). But no, the third constraint is about p2. So this doesn't help. But we need p1 to be in l2_4.

So maybe after driving to l2_4, unload p1 there.

So:

12. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2.

13. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2.

14. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2.

15. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4. (Now p1 is at l2_4, satisfying constraint 7.)

Then load p1 back into t2.

16. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4.

17. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2.

18. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5.

This way, p1 is in l2_4 at step 15, satisfying that constraint.

Now, the steps for p1 are getting quite involved, but necessary to meet all constraints. Now, let's check the constraints related to p1:

- Must be in a1: yes, step 18 (earlier in adjusted steps) when loaded into a1.

- Must be in l2_4: yes, step 15.

- Must be in l1_5: yes, step 11 in the adjusted steps where unloaded at l1_5.

Now, for p2:

p2 starts at l1_2 (c1). Needs to end up at l1_3 (c1). Constraints:

- Must be in l1_2 at some state (already true initially, but if the plan moves it away and back, then it's covered again. But the second constraint says that if it's in l1_2, then it must be in l2_3 at s or after. So even if the initial state counts, we need to ensure that after that, p2 goes to l2_3.

So even though the initial state has p2 in l1_2, the constraint requires that after any occurrence (including the initial state), p2 must be in l2_3 at some point. So the plan must include moving p2 to l2_3.

But how? Because p2 is in c1. To get to l2_3 (c2), we need to use an airplane. So load p2 into a truck in c1, drive to airport l1_1, load into airplane a1, fly to l2_1 (c2's airport), then unload, load into truck in c2, drive to l2_3, unload. Then, perhaps move it back to c1 to reach l1_3.

But the goal is to have p2 in l1_3, which is in c1. So this seems like a detour. But the constraints require that p2 must be in l2_3 at some point after being in l1_2 (even if that initial state counts). So we have to move p2 from c1 to c2's l2_3, then back to c1's l1_3.

Additionally, constraints require:

- p2 must be in l2_1 (sixth constraint).

- p2 must be in l1_4 or l2_2 (third constraint). Since p2 is moving from c1 to c2 and back, maybe during the process, it can pass through l2_2 or l1_4.

Let's outline steps for p2.

Initial location: l1_2 (c1).

Goal: l1_3 (c1).

Constraints:

- After any state where p2 is in l1_2 (including initial), must be in l2_3 at some point after.

- Must be in l2_3.

- Must be in l2_1.

- Must be in l1_4 or l2_2.

So steps for p2:

1. Load p2 into truck t1 (which is at l1_3). Wait, initially, t1 is at l1_3. So to load p2 into t1, we need to bring t1 to l1_2. Because p2 is at l1_2.

So first, drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_2.

Action: drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1.

Then load p2 into t1: loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2.

Then drive t1 to l1_1 (the airport in c1):

drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1.

Unload p2 at l1_1: unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

Now p2 is at l1_1 (c1's airport). Load into airplane a1: loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1.

Fly a1 to l2_1 (c2's airport): flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1.

Unload p2 at l2_1: unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1. Now p2 is at l2_1, satisfying constraint 6.

Now, to get p2 to l2_3, need to use a truck in c2. Truck t2 is at l2_5. Need to drive t2 to l2_1.

But earlier steps for p1 might have moved t2. Wait, in the p1 steps, we had to drive t2 to l2_1. So if we interleave these steps, maybe we can reuse some actions.

But let's proceed step by step.

From p2's perspective:

After being unloaded at l2_1 (c2), load into truck t2 (if t2 is there). But t2 may need to be driven to l2_1.

Assuming t2 is at l2_5, to drive it to l2_1:

drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2.

drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2.

drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2.

drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2.

Load p2 into t2: loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.

Drive t2 to l2_3: drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2; drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2.

Unload p2 at l2_3: unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3. This satisfies the second constraint (p2 in l2_3 after being in l1_2).

Now, to move p2 back to c1. Load into airplane a2 (which is at l2_1, but p2 is at l2_3. So need to drive t2 back to l2_3, load p2, drive to l2_1, unload, load into a2.

But this is getting complicated. Alternatively, after unloading p2 at l2_3, load back into t2 and drive to l2_1, then load into a2 and fly to l1_1.

So steps:

After unloading p2 at l2_3:

loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3.

Drive t2 to l2_1:

drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2.

drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2.

Unload p2 at l2_1: unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.

Load into a2: loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1.

Fly a2 to l1_1: flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

Unload p2 at l1_1: unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1.

Now, p2 is back in c1's airport. Now, use truck t1 to take it to l1_3.

But t1 is at l1_1 (if we drove it there earlier). For example, in the steps for p1, we had to move t1 to l1_1 to load p1. But if we are interleaving p1 and p2 steps, we need to make sure that the trucks are where we need them.

Assuming after handling p1's steps, t1 is back in l1_3. Wait, this is getting very tangled. Let's try to outline the entire plan, considering both p1 and p2.

But this is getting really complex. Let's try to find an optimal plan that satisfies all constraints with minimal steps.

Alternative approach: Since p2 must be in l2_3, which is in c2, but its goal is in c1, we need to transport it to c2 and back. Also, during this process, p2 can visit l2_1 (satisfying constraint 6), l2_3 (required by constraint 2), and maybe l2_2 (for constraint 3).

For p2:

1. Move p2 from l1_2 to l1_1 using truck t1.

   - drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1 (t1 moves to l1_2)

   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

   - drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1

   - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

2. Load p2 into a1 and fly to l2_1.

   - loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

   - flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

   - unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (now p2 is in l2_1, satisfying constraint 6)

3. Move p2 to l2_3 using truck t2.

   - drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (multiple steps)

   - load p2 into t2

   - drive t2 to l2_3

   - unload p2 (satisfies constraint 2)

4. Move p2 back to c1.

   - load into truck t2, drive to l2_1

   - unload and load into a2

   - fly a2 to l1_1

   - unload and load into truck t1

   - drive to l1_3 and unload (goal)

For p1:

1. Load into a2 at l2_1, fly to l1_1.

   - loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

   - fly a2 to l1_1

   - unload p1 into l1_1

2. Load into a1 (satisfies constraint 9)

   - loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

   - fly a1 to l2_1

   - unload p1

3. Move via truck t2 to l2_5, passing through l2_4 (constraint 7).

   - drive t2 to l2_1

   - load p1

   - drive to l2_4, unload (satisfy constraint 7)

   - load again and drive to l2_5

But this seems too many steps. Also, need to ensure that when p2 is in l1_3 (goal), there's an earlier state where p1 was in l2_3 (constraint 5). So during p1's movement, it must pass through l2_3.

Wait, if p1 is transported via truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_5, passing through l2_2, l2_3, l2_4. So when t2 drives from l2_1 to l2_2, then l2_3, then l2_4, etc. If we unload p1 at l2_3, then load again. This would satisfy constraint 5.

But according to the fifth constraint: if p2 is in l1_3 (the goal state), then there must be an earlier state where p1 is in l2_3. So before p2 is in l1_3, p1 must have been in l2_3.

So in the plan, p1 must be in l2_3 before p2 is delivered to l1_3.

Thus, the steps for p1 must include being in l2_3, and p2's delivery to l1_3 must happen after that.

Putting it all together, let's outline the plan step by step, interleaving actions for p1 and p2.

Plan steps:

1. For p2: Move truck t1 from l1_3 to l1_2.

   drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1

2. Load p2 into t1.

   loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

3. Drive t1 to l1_1.

   drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1

4. Unload p2 at l1_1.

   unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

5. Load p2 into a1.

   loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

6. Fly a1 to l2_1.

   flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

7. Unload p2 at l2_1.

   unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (now p2 is in l2_1, constraint 6 met)

8. For p1: Load into a2 at l2_1.

   loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

9. Fly a2 to l1_1.

   flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

10. Unload p1 at l1_1.

    unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

11. Load p1 into a1 (satisfies constraint 9).

    loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

12. Fly a1 to l2_1.

    flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

13. Unload p1 at l2_1.

    unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

14. For p2: Drive truck t2 from l2_5 to l2_4.

    drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2

15. Drive t2 to l2_3.

    drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2

16. Drive t2 to l2_2.

    drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2

17. Drive t2 to l2_1.

    drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2

18. Load p2 into t2.

    loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

19. Drive t2 to l2_2.

    drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2 (passing through l2_2, but need to reach l2_3)

20. Drive t2 to l2_3.

    drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2

21. Unload p2 at l2_3 (constraint 2 met).

    unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3

22. Load p2 back into t2.

    loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3

23. Drive t2 to l2_2.

    drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2 (now p2 is in l2_2, satisfying constraint 3's option)

24. Unload p2 at l2_2.

    unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

25. Load p2 into t2 again.

    loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

26. Drive t2 back to l2_1.

    drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2

27. Unload p2 at l2_1.

    unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

28. Load p2 into a2.

    loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

29. Fly a2 to l1_1.

    flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

30. Unload p2 at l1_1.

    unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

31. Load p2 into truck t1.

    loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

32. Drive t1 to l1_2.

    drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1

33. Drive t1 to l1_3.

    drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1

34. Unload p2 at l1_3 (goal met).

    unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

Now, for p1:

After step 13, p1 is at l2_1. Need to move it to l2_5 via truck t2, passing through l2_4.

But t2 is used for p2. So after step 27, t2 is at l2_1.

35. Load p1 into t2.

    loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

36. Drive t2 to l2_2.

    drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2

37. Drive t2 to l2_3.

    drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2 (p1 is now in l2_3, satisfying constraint 5 for p2's later step)

38. Drive t2 to l2_4.

    drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2

39. Unload p1 at l2_4 (constraint 7 met).

    unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

40. Load p1 back into t2.

    loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

41. Drive t2 to l2_5.

    drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2

42. Unload p1 at l2_5 (goal met).

    unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

Also, during step 37, p1 is in l2_3. Since p2 is unloaded at l1_3 (step 34), which is after step 37, this satisfies constraint 5.

But wait, in this plan, p1 is in l2_3 at step 37, and p2 is unloaded at l1_3 at step 34. So step 34 (p2's goal) occurs after step 37 (p1 in l2_3), which meets the requirement.

Additionally, p1 was in a1 at step 11 (loaded), satisfying constraint 9.

p1 was in l1_1 after step 10 (unloaded from a2), but to satisfy constraint 8 (p1 in l1_5), we need to include steps where p1 is moved to l1_5.

Ah, here's a problem. In the current plan outline, p1 is moved from l1_1 to a1, then flown to l2_1, but never to l1_5. So we're missing constraint 8.

So we need to adjust the plan to include p1 being in l1_5.

Let's insert steps after step 10 (p1 at l1_1):

10.5. Drive truck t1 from l1_3 to l1_1 (but t1 is at l1_1 after step 3? Wait, after step 3, t1 was driven to l1_1, then used for p2. After step 3, t1 is at l1_1. Then in step 4, p2 is unloaded at l1_1. Then steps 5-7 for p2. Then steps 8-10 for p1.

Wait, after step 10, p1 is unloaded at l1_1 (from a2). Then step 11 loads p1 into a1. So between steps 10 and 11, maybe we can move p1 via truck to l1_5.

But a1 is at l1_1. So after step 10, p1 is at l1_1.

10.5. Load p1 into truck t1 (which is at l1_1 after step 3).

loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

10.6. Drive t1 to l1_2.

drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1

10.7. Drive to l1_3.

drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1

10.8. Drive to l1_4.

drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1

10.9. Drive to l1_5.

drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1

10.10. Unload p1 at l1_5 (constraint 8 met).

unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5

10.11. Load p1 back into t1.

loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5

10.12. Drive back to l1_4.

drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1

10.13. Drive to l1_3.

drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1

10.14. Drive to l1_2.

drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1

10.15. Drive to l1_1.

drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1

10.16. Unload p1 at l1_1.

unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

Now, after step 10.16, p1 is back at l1_1, then loaded into a1 in step 11.

This addition ensures p1 is in l1_5 (step 10.10), satisfying constraint 8.

But this adds many steps. Is there a more optimal way?

Alternatively, after step 10 (p1 at l1_1), drive t1 to l1_1 (but t1 is already there?), load p1, drive to l1_5, unload, then drive back.

But steps 1-3 already use t1 for p2. So after step 3, t1 is at l1_1. Then in step 4, unload p2. Then steps 5-7 move p2 via a1.

So between step 7 and step 8, perhaps use t1 to move p1 to l1_5.

Let me adjust the plan:

After step 7 (p2 unloaded at l2_1), proceed with p1 steps.

But this is getting too complex. The optimal plan would require minimizing steps while meeting all constraints. Let's try to find the minimal path.

Alternative idea: Use a1 to carry p1 to l1_1, then truck t1 to l1_5.

But initial steps for p1:

p1 is at l2_1. Load into a2, fly to l1_1, unload. Then load into truck t1, drive to l1_5, unload (satisfies constraint 8), then load back, drive to l1_1, load into a1, fly to l2_1, then use truck t2 to deliver to l2_5.

This would add steps for p1 but satisfy all constraints.

Similarly, for p2, the steps would be to move to l2_3 and back.

Integrating all of this, the plan will be quite long, but let's try to outline it concisely.

Final plan steps (attempting optimality):

1. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1 (move t1 to p2's location)

2. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (load p2)

3. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 (drive to airport)

4. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (p2 at l1_1)

5. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (load into a1)

6. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (fly to c2)

7. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (p2 at l2_1, constraint 6 met)

8. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (p1 loaded into a2)

9. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (fly to c1)

10. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (p1 at l1_1)

11. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (load into t1)

12. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1 (drive towards l1_5)

13. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1

14. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1

15. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1 (p1 arrives at l1_5, constraint 8 met)

16. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5

17. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 (load back)

18. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1

19. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1

20. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1

21. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1

22. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

23. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (loaded into a1, constraint 9 met)

24. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (fly to c2)

25. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 (p1 at l2_1)

26. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2 (move t2 towards l2_1)

27. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2

28. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2

29. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 (t2 arrives at l2_1)

30. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (load p1 into t2)

31. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2

32. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2 (p1 passes through l2_3, satisfying constraint 5)

33. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2

34. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (constraint 7 met)

35. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

36. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2

37. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (p1 goal met)

For p2's remaining steps:

38. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (assuming t2 is back at l2_1 after step 29)

But after step 29, t2 is at l2_1. But steps 30-37 move t2 to l2_5. So need to handle p2 after step 37.

Wait, this is getting too tangled. Let's adjust:

After step 7 (p2 at l2_1):

38. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (t2 is at l2_1 after step 29)

39. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2

40. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2

41. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (constraint 2 met)

42. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3

43. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2

44. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (constraint 3 met)

45. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

46. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2

47. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

48. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

49. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

50. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

51. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

52. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1

53. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1

54. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (p2 goal met)

Now, this plan satisfies all constraints, but it's very long. However, the problem requires an optimal plan with minimal steps. It's possible that some steps can be optimized, but given the constraints, it's challenging.

After carefully considering all constraints and possible actions, here's a possible optimal plan:
