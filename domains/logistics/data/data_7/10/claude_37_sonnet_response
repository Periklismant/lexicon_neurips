This is a logistics planning problem where we have two packages, p1 and p2, and we need to move them to specific locations, l2_5 for p1 and l1_3 for p2. We also have a set of constraints that need to be satisfied during the plan execution. Let's analyze the constraints and the problem step by step.

First, let's understand the initial state:
- Package p1 is in location l2_2
- Package p2 is in location l1_4
- There are trucks t1 and t2, but they appear to be mistakenly labeled as packages in the initial state
- There are airplanes a1 and a2, also mistakenly labeled as packages in the initial state

I'm going to assume that:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_4
- Truck t2 is in location l2_5
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (airport in city c1)
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1 (airport in city c2)

The goal is to get:
- Package p1 to location l2_5
- Package p2 to location l1_3

Let's also analyze the constraints:
1. p2 must be in l1_3 at some point (this is part of the goal anyway)
2. Before p2 is in l1_3, it must be in l1_2 at some earlier point
3. p1 must be in l2_2 at some point (it already is in the initial state)
4. If p1 is in l2_2, then p2 must be in either l1_2 or l1_4 at that time or later
5. p1 must be either in t1 or in l1_1 at some point
6. p1 must be in l1_5 at some point
7. p2 must be either in l2_5 or in a1 at some point
8. p2 must be either in a1 or in l1_5 at some point
9. p2 must be either in l1_1 or in l1_5 at some point

Now, let's create a high-level plan for each package, and then combine them to satisfy all constraints.

For p1 (currently in l2_2, goal: l2_5):
- Constraint 3 is already satisfied (p1 is in l2_2)
- Need to satisfy constraint 5: Move p1 to either t1 or l1_1
- Need to satisfy constraint 6: Move p1 to l1_5
- Finally, move p1 to l2_5

For p2 (currently in l1_4, goal: l1_3):
- Need to satisfy constraint 2: Move p2 to l1_2 before moving it to l1_3
- Need to satisfy constraint 4: Ensure p2 is in l1_2 or l1_4 when or after p1 is in l2_2
- Need to satisfy constraint 7: Move p2 to l2_5 or a1
- Need to satisfy constraint 8: Move p2 to a1 or l1_5
- Need to satisfy constraint 9: Move p2 to l1_1 or l1_5
- Finally, move p2 to l1_3

Since these plans need to be coordinated, I'll create a detailed plan step by step.

First, I notice that several constraints require p2 to be in various locations, including l1_2, l1_5, l2_5 or a1, l1_1 or l1_5 at different points in the plan. 

Let's think through the paths for each package:

For p1:
- p1 starts in l2_2
- We need it to be in t1 or l1_1 (constraint 5)
- We need it to be in l1_5 (constraint 6)
- We want it to end up in l2_5

For p2:
- p2 starts in l1_4
- We need it to be in l1_2 (constraint 2)
- We need it to be in l2_5 or a1 (constraint 7)
- We need it to be in a1 or l1_5 (constraint 8)
- We need it to be in l1_1 or l1_5 (constraint 9)
- We want it to end up in l1_3

Let's plan a path for each:

For p1:
1. Load p1 onto a truck in l2_2
2. Drive the truck to l2_1 (airport)
3. Unload p1 at l2_1
4. Load p1 onto an airplane
5. Fly to l1_1 (satisfying constraint 5)
6. Unload p1 at l1_1
7. Load p1 onto a truck
8. Drive the truck to l1_5 (satisfying constraint 6)
9. Unload p1 at l1_5
10. Load p1 onto a truck
11. Drive the truck to l1_1
12. Unload p1 at l1_1
13. Load p1 onto an airplane
14. Fly to l2_1
15. Unload p1 at l2_1
16. Load p1 onto a truck
17. Drive the truck to l2_5
18. Unload p1 at l2_5 (goal achieved)

For p2:
1. Load p2 onto a truck in l1_4
2. Drive the truck to l1_2 (satisfying constraint 2)
3. Unload p2 at l1_2
4. Load p2 onto a truck
5. Drive the truck to l1_1
6. Unload p2 at l1_1 (satisfying constraint 9)
7. Load p2 onto an airplane (a1)
8. Fly to l2_1
9. Unload p2 at l2_1
10. Load p2 onto a truck
11. Drive the truck to l2_5 (satisfying constraint 7)
12. Unload p2 at l2_5
13. Load p2 onto a truck
14. Drive the truck to l2_1
15. Unload p2 at l2_1
16. Load p2 onto an airplane
17. Fly to l1_1
18. Unload p2 at l1_1
19. Load p2 onto a truck
20. Drive the truck to l1_5 (satisfying constraint 8)
21. Unload p2 at l1_5
22. Load p2 onto a truck
23. Drive the truck to l1_3
24. Unload p2 at l1_3 (goal achieved)

Let's check if these plans satisfy all constraints:
1. p2 is in l1_3 at the end (satisfied)
2. p2 is in l1_2 before it's in l1_3 (satisfied)
3. p1 is in l2_2 at the beginning (satisfied)
4. When p1 is in l2_2, p2 is in l1_4 (satisfied)
5. p1 is in l1_1 (satisfied)
6. p1 is in l1_5 (satisfied)
7. p2 is in l2_5 (satisfied)
8. p2 is in l1_5 (satisfied)
9. p2 is in l1_1 (satisfied)

Now, let's translate this high-level plan into the specific actions required, using the available trucks and airplanes.

Actually, I realize I should first verify if the actions I previously assumed are correct. The problem statement mentioned that trucks and packages were placed in some locations, but then in the original state description, I see that t1, t2, a1, and a2 are referred to as packages. Let me reconstruct the initial state more carefully:

It says:
"Package t1 is in location l1_4"
"Package t2 is in location l2_5"
"Package p1 is in location l2_2"
"Package p2 is in location l1_4"
"Package a1 is in location l1_1"
"Package a2 is in location l2_1"

This seems inconsistent with the description that t1 and t2 are trucks, and a1 and a2 are airplanes. Let me assume that there's an error in the initial state description, and that t1 and t2 are indeed trucks, and a1 and a2 are indeed airplanes, so the initial state should be:

- Truck t1 is in location l1_4
- Truck t2 is in location l2_5
- Package p1 is in location l2_2
- Package p2 is in location l1_4
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

Now, let's create the detailed action plan:

For p1:
1. Load p1 onto truck t2 in l2_2
2. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1 in city c2
3. Unload p1 from t2 in l2_1
4. Load p1 onto airplane a2 in l2_1
5. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1
6. Unload p1 from a2 in l1_1 (satisfying constraint 5)
7. Load p1 onto truck t1
8. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_5 in city c1
9. Unload p1 from t1 in l1_5 (satisfying constraint 6)
10. Load p1 onto truck t1 in l1_5
11. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_1 in city c1
12. Unload p1 from t1 in l1_1
13. Load p1 onto airplane a2 in l1_1
14. Fly a2 from l1_1 to l2_1
15. Unload p1 from a2 in l2_1
16. Load p1 onto truck t2 in l2_1
17. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_5 in city c2
18. Unload p1 from t2 in l2_5 (goal achieved)

For p2:
1. Load p2 onto truck t1 in l1_4
2. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_2 in city c1
3. Unload p2 from t1 in l1_2 (satisfying constraint 2)
4. Load p2 onto truck t1 in l1_2
5. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1 in city c1
6. Unload p2 from t1 in l1_1 (satisfying constraint 9)
7. Load p2 onto airplane a1 in l1_1
8. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1
9. Unload p2 from a1 in l2_1
10. Load p2 onto truck t2 in l2_1
11. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_5 in city c2
12. Unload p2 from t2 in l2_5 (satisfying constraint 7)
13. Load p2 onto truck t2 in l2_5
14. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 in city c2
15. Unload p2 from t2 in l2_1
16. Load p2 onto airplane a1 in l2_1
17. Fly a1 from l2_1 to l1_1
18. Unload p2 from a1 in l1_1
19. Load p2 onto truck t1 in l1_1
20. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_5 in city c1
21. Unload p2 from t1 in l1_5 (satisfying constraint 8)
22. Load p2 onto truck t1 in l1_5
23. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_3 in city c1
24. Unload p2 from t1 in l1_3 (goal achieved)

However, there's a problem with these plans: we can't execute them independently because we're using the same trucks and airplanes. We need to interleave the actions to create a valid plan that doesn't try to use the same resource simultaneously for different purposes.

Let's think about a more integrated plan that accomplishes both goals efficiently.

Actually, I realize that we don't need to satisfy all the constraints at the same time. The constraints simply state that at some point during plan execution, certain conditions must hold. So, we can simplify our plan considerably.

Here's a revised plan:

1. Load p1 onto truck t2 in l2_2
2. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1 in city c2
3. Unload p1 from t2 in l2_1
4. Load p1 onto airplane a2 in l2_1
5. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1
6. Unload p1 from a2 in l1_1 (satisfying constraint 5)
7. Load p1 onto truck t1 in l1_1
8. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_5 in city c1
9. Unload p1 from t1 in l1_5 (satisfying constraint 6)
10. Load p2 onto truck t1 in l1_4
11. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_2 in city c1
12. Unload p2 from t1 in l1_2 (satisfying constraint 2)
13. Load p2 onto truck t1 in l1_2
14. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1 in city c1
15. Unload p2 from t1 in l1_1 (satisfying constraint 9)
16. Load p2 onto airplane a1 in l1_1
17. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1
18. Unload p2 from a1 in l2_1
19. Load p2 onto truck t2 in l2_1
20. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_5 in city c2
21. Unload p2 from t2 in l2_5 (satisfying constraint 7)
22. Load p1 onto truck t2 in l1_5 (I think this is an error, p1 should be in l1_5 from step 9)
23. Load p1 onto airplane a1 in l1_1 (again, p1 should be in l1_5 from step 9)

Let me correct this plan. I made some mistakes in tracking the locations of packages and vehicles, and I'm being inconsistent about which steps I'm including. Let me start fresh with a more careful plan.

First, let's clarify the initial state:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_4
- Truck t2 is in location l2_5
- Package p1 is in location l2_2
- Package p2 is in location l1_4
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

Let's break down the constraints again:
1. p2 must be in l1_3 at some point (this is part of the goal)
2. Before p2 is in l1_3, it must be in l1_2 at some earlier point
3. p1 must be in l2_2 at some point (it is in the initial state)
4. If p1 is in l2_2, then p2 must be in either l1_2 or l1_4 at that time or later (p2 is in l1_4 in the initial state)
5. p1 must be either in t1 or in l1_1 at some point
6. p1 must be in l1_5 at some point
7. p2 must be either in l2_5 or in a1 at some point
8. p2 must be either in a1 or in l1_5 at some point
9. p2 must be either in l1_1 or in l1_5 at some point

Let's create a plan for each package, ensuring all constraints are met, and then combine them correctly.

For p1 (goal: l2_5):
- Constraint 3 is already satisfied in the initial state
- To satisfy constraint 5, we need to move p1 to either t1 or l1_1
- To satisfy constraint 6, we need to move p1 to l1_5
- Finally, we move p1 to l2_5

For p2 (goal: l1_3):
- Constraints 4 is satisfied in the initial state
- To satisfy constraint 2, we need to move p2 to l1_2 before reaching l1_3
- To satisfy constraints 7, 8, and 9, we need to move p2 through some combination of l2_5, a1, l1_5, and l1_1
- Finally, we move p2 to l1_3

Now, let's create a detailed plan:

1. Starting state: p1 in l2_2, p2 in l1_4, t1 in l1_4, t2 in l2_5, a1 in l1_1, a2 in l2_1
2. We need to move p1 to either t1 or l1_1 (constraint 5)
   - First, we need to get t2 to l2_2 to pick up p1, then get p1 to an airport to fly it to l1_1
   - drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
   - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
   - drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
   - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
   - loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
   - flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
   - unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (satisfying constraint 5)
3. We need to move p1 to l1_5 (constraint 6)
   - drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
   - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
   - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
   - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 (satisfying constraint 6)
4. We need to move p2 to l1_2 before it goes to l1_3 (constraint 2)
   - drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1
   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
   - drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1
   - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (satisfying constraint 2)
5. We need to move p2 to one of: l2_5 or a1 (constraint 7)
   - drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
   - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (satisfying constraint 9)
   - loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
   - flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
   - unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (satisfying constraint 7 through a1)
6. We need to move p2 to one of: a1 or l1_5 (constraint 8)
   - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
   - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
   - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 (satisfying constraint 7 directly)
   - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
   - drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
   - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
   - loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
   - flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
   - unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
   - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
   - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 (satisfying constraint 8)
7. We now need to move p2 to l1_3 (goal)
   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
   - drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1
   - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (p2 goal achieved)
8. Finally, we need to move p1 to l2_5 (goal)
   - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
   - drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
   - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
   - loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
   - flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
   - unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
   - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
   - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
   - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (p1 goal achieved)

Let me verify that this plan is correct and satisfies all constraints.

However, I think there are some issues with this plan, primarily related to tracking the locations of trucks and airplanes. Let me try again with a more methodical approach.

I'm going to simplify the constraints and plan more directly.

Here are the initial conditions again:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_4
- Truck t2 is in location l2_5
- Package p1 is in location l2_2
- Package p2 is in location l1_4
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

And our goal is:
- Package p1 is in location l2_5
- Package p2 is in location l1_3

Let's plan the movements needed to satisfy all constraints:

Constraint 1: p2 must be in l1_3 (this is part of our goal)
Constraint 2: p2 must be in l1_2 before l1_3
    - We need to move p2 from l1_4 to l1_2, then to l1_3
Constraint 3: p1 must be in l2_2 (it already is in the initial state)
Constraint 4: When p1 is in l2_2, p2 must be in l1_2 or l1_4
    - This is satisfied in the initial state (p1 is in l2_2, p2 is in l1_4)
Constraint 5: p1 must be in t1 or l1_1
    - We need to move p1 to either t1 or l1_1
Constraint 6: p1 must be in l1_5
    - We need to move p1 to l1_5
Constraint 7: p2 must be in l2_5 or a1
    - We need to move p2 to either l2_5 or a1
Constraint 8: p2 must be in a1 or l1_5
    - We need to move p2 to either a1 or l1_5
Constraint 9: p2 must be in l1_1 or l1_5
    - We need to move p2 to either l1_1 or l1_5

Here's a plan that satisfies all constraints:

1. Load p2 onto t1 in l1_4
2. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_2 in c1
3. Unload p2 from t1 in l1_2 (satisfying constraint 2)
4. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l2_2 (oops, this is not possible as t1 is in city c1 and l2_2 is in city c2)

Let me restart with a more careful plan.

Given the initial state:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_4
- Truck t2 is in location l2_5
- Package p1 is in location l2_2
- Package p2 is in location l1_4
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

Let's trace the movements carefully:

1. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2 in c2
   - Now t2 is in l2_2 with p1
2. Load p1 onto t2 in l2_2
   - Now p1 is in t2, which is in l2_2
3. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1 in c2
   - Now t2 with p1 is in l2_1
4. Unload p1 from t2 in l2_1
   - Now p1 is in l2_1, t2 is in l2_1
5. Load p1 onto a2 in l2_1
   - Now p1 is in a2, which is in l2_1
6. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1
   - Now a2 with p1 is in l1_1
7. Unload p1 from a2 in l1_1
   - Now p1 is in l1_1, a2 is in l1_1 (satisfying constraint 5)
8. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1 in c1
   - Now t1 is in l1_1 with p1
9. Load p1 onto t1 in l1_1
   - Now p1 is in t1, which is in l1_1 (also satisfying constraint 5)
10. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_5 in c1
    - Now t1 with p1 is in l1_5
11. Unload p1 from t1 in l1_5
    - Now p1 is in l1_5, t1 is in l1_5 (satisfying constraint 6)
12. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_4 in c1
    - Now t1 is in l1_4 with p2
13. Load p2 onto t1 in l1_4
    - Now p2 is in t1, which is in l1_4
14. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_2 in c1
    - Now t1 with p2 is in l1_2
15. Unload p2 from t1 in l1_2
    - Now p2 is in l1_2, t1 is in l1_2 (satisfying constraint 2)
16. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1 in c1
    - Now t1 is in l1_1
17. Load p2 onto t1 in l1_2
    - Now p2 is in t1, which is in l1_2
18. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1 in c1
    - Now t1 with p2 is in l1_1
19. Unload p2 from t1 in l1_1
    - Now p2 is in l1_1, t1 is in l1_1 (satisfying constraint 9)
20. Load p2 onto a1 in l1_1
    - Now p2 is in a1, which is in l1_1 (satisfying constraints 7 and 8)
21. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_5 in c1
    - Now t1 is in l1_5 with p1
22. Load p1 onto t1 in l1_5
    - Now p1 is in t1, which is in l1_5
23. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_1 in c1
    - Now t1 with p1 is in l1_1
24. Unload p1 from t1 in l1_1
    - Now p1 is in l1_1, t1 is in l1_1
25. Load p1 onto a2 in l1_1
    - Now p1 is in a2, which is in l1_1
26. Fly a2 from l1_1 to l2_1
    - Now a2 with p1 is in l2_1
27. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l1_1 (this is redundant, a1 is already in l1_1)
28. Unload p2 from a1 in l1_1
    - Now p2 is in l1_1, a1 is in l1_1
29. Load p2 onto t1 in l1_1
    - Now p2 is in t1, which is in l1_1
30. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_5 in c1
    - Now t1 with p2 is in l1_5
31. Unload p2 from t1 in l1_5
    - Now p2 is in l1_5, t1 is in l1_5 (satisfying constraints 8 and 9)
32. Load p2 onto t1 in l1_5
    - Now p2 is in t1, which is in l1_5
33. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_3 in c1
    - Now t1 with p2 is in l1_3
34. Unload p2 from t1 in l1_3
    - Now p2 is in l1_3, t1 is in l1_3 (p2 goal achieved, constraint 1 satisfied)
35. Unload p1 from a2 in l2_1
    - Now p1 is in l2_1, a2 is in l2_1
36. Load p1 onto t2 in l2_1
    - Now p1 is in t2, which is in l2_1
37. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_5 in c2
    - Now t2 with p1 is in l2_5
38. Unload p1 from t2 in l2_5
    - Now p1 is in l2_5, t2 is in l2_5 (p1 goal achieved)

Oops, I realized I included a redundant step #27, and there are some inconsistencies with tracking where p2 is. Let me redo this carefully:

1. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2 in c2
   - Now t2 is in l2_2 with p1
2. Load p1 onto t2 in l2_2
   - Now p1 is in t2, which is in l2_2
3. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1 in c2
   - Now t2 with p1 is in l2_1
4. Unload p1 from t2 in l2_1
   - Now p1 is in l2_1, t2 is in l2_1
5. Load p1 onto a2 in l2_1
   - Now p1 is in a2, which is in l2_1
6. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1
   - Now a2 with p1 is in l1_1
7. Unload p1 from a2 in l1_1
   - Now p1 is in l1_1, a2 is in l1_1 (satisfying constraint 5)
8. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1 in c1
   - Now t1 is in l1_1 with p1
9. Load p1 onto t1 in l1_1
   - Now p1 is in t1, which is in l1_1 (also satisfying constraint 5)
10. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_5 in c1

Let me review this plan to make sure it satisfies all constraints and the goals:

1. p1 is in l2_5 (goal)
2. p2 is in l1_3 (goal and constraint 1)
3. p2 is in l1_2 before it's in l1_3 (constraint 2)
4. p1 is in l2_2 (constraint 3)
5. When p1 is in l2_2, p2 is in l1_4 (constraint 4)
6. p1 is in t1 and l1_1 (constraint 5)
7. p1 is in l1_5 (constraint 6)
8. p2 is in l2_5 and a1 (constraint 7)
9. p2 is in a1 and l1_5 (constraint 8)
10. p2 is in l1_1 and l1_5 (constraint 9)

All constraints are satisfied.

However, this plan can be optimized. Let me see if I can make it shorter.

Actually, upon reflection, I think there are some redundancies in this plan. Let me try to simplify it further.

Here's a more efficient plan:

1. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2 in c2
2. Load p1 onto t2 in l2_2
3. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1 in c2
4. Unload p1 from t2 in l2_1
5. Load p1 onto a2 in l2_1
6. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1
7. Unload p1 from a2 in l1_1 (satisfying constraint 5)
8. Load p1 onto t1 in l1_1
9. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1 in c1
10. Load p1 onto t1 in l1_1 (already done, redundant)
11. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_5 in c1
12. Unload p1 from t1 in l1_5 (satisfying constraint 6)

Oops, there's an issue. t1 is in l1_4 initially, but I have it in l1_1 in step 9. Let me redo this carefully.

Here's the optimized plan:

1. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2 in c2
2. Load p1 onto t2 in l2_2
3. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1 in c2
4. Unload p1 from t2 in l2_1
5. Load p1 onto a2 in l2_1
6. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1
7. Unload p1 from a2 in l1_1 (satisfying constraint 5)
8. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1 in c1
9. Load p1 onto t1 in l1_1
10. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_5 in c1
11. Unload p1 from t1 in l1_5 (satisfying constraint 6)
12. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_4 in c1
13. Load p2 onto t1 in l1_4
14. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_2 in c1
15. Unload p2 from t1 in l1_2 (satisfying constraint 2)
16. Load p2 onto t1 in l1_2
17. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1 in c1
18. Unload p2 from t1 in l1_1 (satisfying constraint 9)
19. Load p2 onto a1 in l1_1
20. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1
21. Unload p2 from a1 in l2_1
22. Load p2 onto t2 in l2_1
23. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_5 in c2
24. Unload p2 from t2 in l2_5 (satisfying constraint 7)
25. Load p2 onto t2 in l2_5
26. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 in c2
27. Unload p2 from t2 in l2_1
28. Load p2 onto a1 in l2_1
29. Fly a1 from l2_1 to l1_1
30. Unload p2 from a1 in l1_1
31. Load p2 onto t1 in l1_1
32. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_5 in c1
33. Unload p2 from t1 in l1_5 (satisfying constraint 8)
34. Load p2 onto t1 in l1_5
35. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_3 in c1
36. Unload p2 from t1 in l1_3 (p2 goal achieved)
37. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_5 in c1
38. Load p1 onto t1 in l1_5
39. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_1 in c1
40. Unload p1 from t1 in l1_1
41. Load p1 onto a2 in l1_1
42. Fly a2 from l1_1 to l2_1
43. Unload p1 from a2 in l2_1
44. Load p1 onto t2 in l2_1
45. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_5 in c2
46. Unload p1 from t2 in l2_5 (p1 goal achieved)

This should be a valid plan that satisfies all constraints and achieves both goals. Let me double-check it:

1. p1 is in l2_5 (goal) ✓
2. p2 is in l1_3 (goal and constraint 1) ✓
3. p2 is in l1_2 before it's in l1_3 (constraint 2) ✓
4. p1 is in l2_2 (constraint 3) ✓
5. When p1 is in l2_2, p2 is in l1_4 (constraint 4) ✓
6. p1 is in t1 and l1_1 (constraint 5) ✓
7. p1 is in l1_5 (constraint 6) ✓
8. p2 is in l2_5 and a1 (constraint 7) ✓
9. p2 is in a1 and l1_5 (constraint 8) ✓
10. p2 is in l1_1 and l1_5 (constraint 9) ✓

All constraints are satisfied, and both goals are achieved.

The plan is:

```
drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

```

Actually, I see there's another problem. This plan assumes that the packages can be in two places at once, or that the trucks can pick up packages not at their location. Let me carefully check each step to make sure everything is consistent.

Actually, I see I misread several parts of the problem. For instance:
- Package t1 is in location l1_4
- Package t2 is in location l2_5
- Package p1 is in location l2_2
- Package p2 is in location l1_4
- Package a1 is in location l1_1
- Package a2 is in location l2_1

These should be:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_4
- Truck t2 is in location l2_5
- Package p1 is in location l2_2
- Package p2 is in location l1_4
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

This matches the schema of objects that was established earlier.

I think my plan is largely correct, but let me double-check each step to ensure consistency with the world state.
