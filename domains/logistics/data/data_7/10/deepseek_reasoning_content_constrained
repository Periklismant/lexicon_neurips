Okay, let me try to figure out this planning problem. So, the goal is to get package p1 to l2_5 and p2 to l1_3. There are a bunch of constraints that the plan must satisfy, which complicates things. Let's start by understanding the initial state and the required conditions.

First, the initial state:

- Locations:
  - c1 has l1_1 (airport), l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5.
  - c2 has l2_1 (airport), l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5.
  
- Packages:
  - p1 is in l2_2 (which is in c2).
  - p2 is in l1_4 (c1).
  
- Trucks:
  - t1 is in l1_4 (c1).
  - t2 is in l2_5 (c2).
  
- Airplanes:
  - a1 is in l1_1 (c1's airport).
  - a2 is in l2_1 (c2's airport).

The goal is p1 at l2_5 and p2 at l1_3. Let's think about how to move them.

For p1: It's in l2_2 (c2). To get to l2_5 (same city, c2). So maybe use truck t2, which is in l2_5. Wait, t2 is already in l2_5? Then how do we get p1 from l2_2 to l2_5? If t2 is in l2_5, maybe we need to drive t2 to l2_2, load p1, then drive back. Wait, initial state says "Package t2 is in location l2_5" — wait, that's a typo? Because t2 is a truck. Oh, the original state says "Package t1 is in location l1_4", but t1 is a truck. Wait, that must be a mistake. The user probably meant "Truck t1 is in location l1_4". Similarly, "Package t2 is in location l2_5" should be "Truck t2 is in l2_5". Similarly for airplanes: "Package a1 is in l1_1" should be "Airplane a1 is in l1_1". Otherwise, the problem is inconsistent because airplanes and trucks are not packages. So assuming those are typos, let's correct that mentally.

So, initial positions:

- Trucks: t1 at l1_4 (c1), t2 at l2_5 (c2).

- Airplanes: a1 at l1_1 (c1's airport), a2 at l2_1 (c2's airport).

- Packages: p1 at l2_2 (c2), p2 at l1_4 (c1).

So for p1: It's in l2_2 (c2). Need to get to l2_5. Since t2 is in l2_5, but to load p1 into t2, they must be in the same location. So we need to drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2, load p1, then drive back to l2_5 and unload. But wait, driving a truck between locations in the same city. c2's locations are l2_1 (airport), l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5. So t2 is in l2_5. To get to l2_2, we can drive through possible intermediate locations? Or can we drive directly? The drivetruck action allows moving from any location to any other in the same city. So drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2, load p1, then drive back to l2_5 and unload. That would work for p1.

For p2: It's in l1_4 (c1). Need to get to l1_3. Truck t1 is in l1_4. So load p2 into t1, drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_3, then unload. That seems straightforward.

But there are multiple constraints that must be satisfied. Let's look at the constraints:

1. The following must hold in at least one state: p2 in l1_3 (which is the goal, so that's covered).

2. If p2 is in l1_3 in some state, there must be an earlier state where p2 is in l1_2. So before p2 reaches l1_3, it must have been in l1_2 at some point. But according to the current plan, p2 is moved directly from l1_4 to l1_3. So this violates the constraint. So we need to make sure that p2 goes through l1_2 before reaching l1_3. So perhaps drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_2, unload p2 there (so it's in l1_2), then load again into t1, drive to l1_3 and unload. But that would require multiple steps. Hmm.

But wait, the initial location of p2 is l1_4. To get to l1_3 via l1_2, we need to move the truck through l1_4 → ... → l1_2 → l1_3. But the cities are c1 for these locations. So t1 is in c1. So possible route: l1_4 → l1_2 → l1_3. So drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_2, unload p2 (so it's in l1_2), then load p2 again into t1, drive to l1_3 and unload. But that would require loading and unloading twice. Alternatively, maybe use another truck? But the only truck in c1 is t1. So maybe that's the way.

But this complicates the plan. Let's note that constraint.

3. At least once, p1 is in l2_2. Which it is initially, so that's covered if the initial state counts. But the problem says "the original state of the world" includes that p1 is in l2_2. So if the initial state counts as a state where p1 is in l2_2, then that's satisfied. But perhaps the constraints require that this occurs during the plan execution, not just the initial state. The problem statement says "must hold in at least one state". The initial state is a state, so if p1 starts in l2_2, that's already met. But the problem might require that during the plan, it's in l2_2 again? Not sure. But assuming the initial state counts, that's covered.

4. If p1 is in l2_2 in some state s, then either p2 is in l1_2 or l1_4 at s or later. Since p1 starts in l2_2, but during the plan, when we move p1, perhaps we need to ensure that after s (the state where p1 is in l2_2), p2 is in l1_2 or l1_4. Since in the initial state, p2 is in l1_4, which satisfies the condition. But if during the plan, after moving p1 from l2_2, we need to make sure that p2 is in l1_2 or l1_4 at some point. Wait, the constraint says that if p1 is in l2_2 in state s, then in s or after s, p2 is in l1_2 or l1_4. Since the initial state has p1 in l2_2 and p2 in l1_4, that satisfies this constraint. But when we move p1 out of l2_2 (by loading it into t2 and driving away), we need to make sure that either p2 is in l1_2 or l1_4 at that state or later. Since p2's movement is part of the plan, maybe this is already handled. For example, p2 is moved to l1_2, then to l1_3. So during the time p1 is being moved, p2 might be in l1_2, which would satisfy this.

5. At least one state must have p1 in t1 or l1_1. But t1 is in c1, and p1 is in c2. So how can p1 be in t1 (c1's truck) or l1_1 (c1's airport)? That would require moving p1 from c2 to c1. So maybe using an airplane. For example, fly a2 (which is in l2_1, c2's airport) to l2_1 (wait, no, a2 is already there. To move p1 from l2_2 to l2_1 (airport), load into a2, fly to l1_1 (c1's airport), unload, then load into t1. But that's a longer plan. But this is required by the constraints: at least once, p1 is in t1 or l1_1. So the plan must include moving p1 to either t1 or l1_1 at some point.

Wait, but the goal is to have p1 in l2_5 (c2). If we move p1 to c1, we have to bring it back. So that complicates things. But the constraints require that in some state, p1 is in t1 or l1_1. So even if we later move it back to c2, this must happen.

Similarly, other constraints:

6. At least once, p1 is in l1_5. So p1 must be moved to l1_5 (c1) at some point. But l1_5 is in c1, and the goal is l2_5 (c2). So p1 has to go from c2 to c1 (to l1_5), then back to c2. That's a lot of steps.

But this seems necessary. So the plan for p1 would involve:

- From l2_2 (c2), load into truck t2 (but t2 is in l2_5 initially). So drive t2 to l2_2, load p1, drive back to l2_5. But that would not involve moving p1 to c1. But according to constraints, we need to have p1 in l1_5 and in t1 or l1_1. So maybe a better approach is to move p1 from c2 to c1 via airplane.

Wait, the airplanes can fly between airports. a2 is in l2_1 (c2's airport). So to move p1 from l2_2 (c2) to l2_1 (airport), we can use a truck. Let's see:

- In c2, truck t2 is in l2_5. Drive t2 to l2_2, load p1, then drive to l2_1 (airport). Then load p1 into airplane a2, fly a2 to l1_1 (c1's airport). Then unload p1 into l1_1. Then load into truck t1 (which is in l1_4, so drive t1 to l1_1, load p1, then drive to l1_5, unload. Then, to get p1 back to c2, load into airplane a1 (which is at l1_1), fly to l2_1, unload, load into truck t2 (drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1, load p1, drive to l2_5, unload. That's a lot of steps, but necessary to satisfy the constraints that p1 is in l1_5 and in t1 or l1_1.

But this seems very lengthy. Let's check the constraints again:

Constraints:

5. At least one state where p1 is in t1 or l1_1.

6. At least one state where p1 is in l1_5.

7. At least one state where p2 is in l2_5 or a1.

8. At least one state where p2 is in a1 or l1_5.

9. At least one state where p2 is in l1_1 or l1_5.

So for p2, the constraints require that:

- Must pass through l1_2 before reaching l1_3.

- At some point, p2 is in l2_5 or a1. But p2 starts in c1, so getting it to l2_5 (c2) would require moving it between cities. Similarly, a1 is in c1's airport. So to get p2 into a1, we can load it into a1 and then maybe fly somewhere else, but that's not needed for the goal. But the constraint requires that at some state, p2 is in l2_5 or a1. So maybe we need to move p2 into a1 (c1's airport) temporarily.

But the goal is to have p2 in l1_3 (c1). So moving p2 to a1 (l1_1) would require:

- Using truck t1 to move p2 from l1_4 to l1_1 (airport), load into a1, then unload again, but why? Unless we need to satisfy the constraints. Let's see.

Constraints 7: p2 in l2_5 or a1. Since the goal is l1_3, moving p2 to a1 (l1_1) would satisfy that. But how?

So for p2's constraints:

- Constraint 2: p2 must be in l1_2 before l1_3.

- Constraints 7,8,9: p2 must be in a1, l1_5, l1_1, or l2_5 at various points.

But moving p2 to l1_2 (as per constraint 2) and then to l1_3 (goal) is necessary. But the other constraints require that p2 is in a1, l1_5, etc.

Wait, constraint 7: at least one state where p2 is in l2_5 or a1. l2_5 is in c2. So to get p2 to l2_5, we need to move it from c1 to c2. That's possible via airplane. But the goal is to have p2 in l1_3 (c1), so moving it to c2 and back would add steps. Alternatively, moving p2 into a1 (which is in c1's airport) would satisfy constraint 7. So let's say we load p2 into a1 at some point.

Similarly, constraint 8: p2 in a1 or l1_5. If we put p2 in a1, that covers both 7 and 8. But then constraint 9 requires p2 in l1_1 or l1_5. If we unload p2 from a1 into l1_1, that would cover constraint 9. Then, move p2 from l1_1 to l1_5 (via truck), then to l1_2, then to l1_3. That's a lot, but necessary.

So putting this together, for p2:

1. Move from l1_4 (current location) to l1_1 (airport) via truck t1.

   - Load p2 into t1 at l1_4.

   - Drive t1 to l1_1.

   - Unload p2 into l1_1. (This satisfies constraint 9: p2 in l1_1.)

2. Load p2 into airplane a1 at l1_1. (Now p2 is in a1, satisfying constraints 7 and 8.)

3. Fly a1 to some location. But since we need to eventually get p2 to l1_3, maybe fly a1 to l1_1 (no, it's already there). Alternatively, fly a1 to l2_1 (c2's airport), but that would take p2 to c2. But then we need to bring it back. Hmm. But if we just load into a1 and unload back into l1_1, that's enough to satisfy constraints 7 and 8.

Wait, constraint 7 requires p2 in l2_5 or a1. If we load p2 into a1 (which is in l1_1), then that's a state where p2 is in a1. So that satisfies constraint 7. Similarly, constraint 8 requires p2 in a1 or l1_5. So loading into a1 satisfies that. Then, after that, we can unload p2 back into l1_1 (satisfying constraint 9: l1_1). Then, load p2 into t1, drive to l1_5, unload (satisfies constraint 6: p1 in l1_5, but wait, that's for p1. Wait, constraint 6 is about p1. So constraint 6 is separate.

Wait, constraint 6 is: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'Package p1 is in location l1_5'". So p1 has to be moved to l1_5 in c1. So that requires moving p1 from c2 to c1, which is a big detour.

This complicates things because p1's goal is in c2. So let's handle both packages.

Let me outline the steps for both packages, considering all constraints.

For p1:

Constraints:

- Must be in t1 or l1_1 at some point (constraint 5).

- Must be in l1_5 at some point (constraint 6).

So p1 has to be moved to c1. Let's plan:

1. In c2, load p1 into truck t2, drive to l2_1 (airport), load into airplane a2, fly to l1_1 (c1's airport), unload. Now p1 is in l1_1 (satisfies constraint 5).

2. Load p1 into truck t1 (drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1), load, drive to l1_5, unload (satisfies constraint 6).

3. Then, load p1 back into truck t1, drive to l1_1, load into airplane a1 (or a2?), fly back to l2_1, unload, load into truck t2, drive to l2_5.

For p2:

Constraints:

- Must be in l1_3 (goal), but before that, in l1_2.

- Must be in a1 or l2_5 (constraint 7).

- Must be in a1 or l1_5 (constraint 8).

- Must be in l1_1 or l1_5 (constraint 9).

So steps for p2:

1. Initially in l1_4. Load into t1.

2. Drive t1 to l1_2, unload (now p2 is in l1_2, satisfying the requirement for the goal).

3. Then, load p2 back into t1, drive to l1_1, unload (satisfies constraint 9: l1_1).

4. Load p2 into a1 (now in a1, satisfying constraints 7 and 8).

5. Unload p2 back into l1_1.

6. Load into t1, drive to l1_5, unload (satisfies constraint 8: l1_5, and constraint 9: l1_5).

7. Then, load into t1 again, drive to l1_3, unload (goal).

But this is a lot of steps, but necessary to satisfy all constraints.

Now, combining both packages' plans.

But the problem is that actions for p1 and p2 can be interleaved. We need to find a sequence that meets all constraints and is optimal (shortest possible).

But considering the constraints, perhaps there's a way to combine steps to minimize the total number of actions.

Let's try to outline the steps:

For p1:

1. In c2, p1 is in l2_2. Need to get to l2_5.

But to satisfy constraints 5 and 6, p1 must go to c1.

So steps for p1:

a. Drive t2 (in l2_5) to l2_2.

b. Load p1 into t2.

c. Drive t2 to l2_1 (airport).

d. Unload p1 into l2_1.

e. Load p1 into airplane a2.

f. Fly a2 to l1_1 (c1's airport).

g. Unload p1 into l1_1 (now satisfies constraint 5: p1 in l1_1).

h. Load p1 into truck t1 (drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1).

i. Drive t1 to l1_5.

j. Unload p1 (satisfies constraint 6: p1 in l1_5).

k. Now, to get p1 back to c2:

l. Load p1 into t1.

m. Drive t1 to l1_1.

n. Load p1 into airplane a1.

o. Fly a1 to l2_1.

p. Unload p1 into l2_1.

q. Load p1 into truck t2 (drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1).

r. Drive t2 to l2_5.

s. Unload p1 into l2_5 (goal).

For p2:

1. Initial location l1_4.

a. Load p2 into t1.

b. Drive t1 to l1_2.

c. Unload p2 (satisfies constraint 2: p2 in l1_2 before l1_3).

d. Load p2 into t1 again.

e. Drive t1 to l1_1.

f. Unload p2 (satisfies constraint 9: l1_1).

g. Load p2 into a1 (satisfies constraints 7 and 8: in a1).

h. Unload p2 into l1_1.

i. Load into t1.

j. Drive to l1_5, unload (satisfies constraint 8 and 9: l1_5).

k. Load into t1 again.

l. Drive to l1_3, unload (goal).

But interleaving these steps could save time. For example, when moving t1 for p2, maybe also use it for p1's steps in c1.

But this is getting very long. The optimal plan would need to minimize steps, but satisfying all constraints.

Alternatively, perhaps some constraints can be satisfied in overlapping steps.

For example, when p1 is in l1_1 (after being flown there), that's one state satisfying constraint 5. When p1 is driven to l1_5, that's another state.

For p2, moving it to l1_2 satisfies the pre-goal condition, then moving to l1_3.

But the constraints require that when p1 is in l2_2 (which is initially true), then p2 must be in l1_2 or l1_4 at that state or later. Since initially p2 is in l1_4, that's satisfied. But when we move p1 out of l2_2, we need to ensure that after that, p2 is in l1_2 or l1_4. But since p2 is moved to l1_2 later, that would satisfy it.

But the problem is the constraint 4: If p1 is in l2_2 in state s, then in s or later, p2 is in l1_2 or l1_4.

In the initial state, p1 is in l2_2 and p2 is in l1_4. So that's already satisfied. So the initial state takes care of that. So when p1 is moved out of l2_2 (loaded into t2), the constraint is already met because in the initial state, which is state s where p1 is in l2_2, p2 is in l1_4. So that's okay. So no need to worry about this constraint after the initial state.

Similarly, constraint 3 requires that p1 is in l2_2 at least once. Which is already in the initial state.

So the main issue is the other constraints.

So perhaps we can handle the constraints with minimal steps.

Let's see:

For p1:

- Needs to be in t1 or l1_1 (constraint 5). So load p1 into t1 (but t1 is in c1). Wait, p1 is in c2 initially. To get p1 into t1, which is in c1, we need to move p1 from c2 to c1.

Similarly, to get p1 to l1_5 (constraint 6), which is in c1.

So p1 must be transported to c1, then back to c2.

For p2:

- Needs to go through l1_2 before l1_3.

- Needs to be in a1 (constraint 7 and 8), and in l1_1 or l1_5 (constraint 9).

So perhaps the steps are:

For p1:

1. In c2: load p1 into t2, drive to l2_1 (airport), load into a2, fly to l1_1 (c1), unload. Now p1 is in l1_1 (satisfies constraint 5).

2. Load p1 into t1, drive to l1_5, unload (satisfies constraint 6).

3. Load p1 into t1, drive to l1_1, load into a1, fly to l2_1 (c2), unload.

4. Load into t2, drive to l2_5, unload (goal).

For p2:

1. Load into t1 (at l1_4), drive to l1_2, unload (satisfies constraint 2).

2. Load into t1 again, drive to l1_1, unload (satisfies constraint 9).

3. Load into a1 (satisfies constraints 7 and 8).

4. Unload into l1_1 (but this might not be necessary unless we need to move it further).

Wait, but after step 3, p2 is in a1, which is in l1_1. To move to l1_3, we need to:

5. Load into t1, drive to l1_3, unload (goal).

But after step 3, p2 is in a1. So to unload, we need to have a1 in l1_1, which it is. So unload p2 from a1 to l1_1. Then load into t1, drive to l1_3.

But this adds steps. Alternatively, fly a1 to another location? Not necessary.

But the problem is that p2 needs to be in l1_3. So after step 3 (p2 in a1), we can unload into l1_1, then load into t1, drive to l1_3.

But then the steps for p2 would be:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1

3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

4. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

5. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1

6. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

7. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

8. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l1_1 (no, need to fly to same location?) Wait, can't fly to the same location. So to unload p2 from a1 in l1_1, we don't need to fly. Just load and unload.

Wait, the unloadairplane action requires that the airplane is in l. So if a1 is in l1_1, we can unload p2 into l1_1.

So after step 7 (p2 loaded into a1), we can immediately unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1. Then, load into t1 again, drive to l1_3.

But this adds steps. Alternatively, can we fly a1 to another airport, but that's not needed.

So steps for p2:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1

3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

4. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

5. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1

6. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

7. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

8. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

9. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

10. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1

11. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

But this is a lot of steps, but necessary to meet constraints.

Now, combining both plans.

But how to interleave them optimally.

Let's try to outline the plan step by step, considering interleaving actions for p1 and p2 to minimize steps.

Initial state:

- p1 in l2_2 (c2)

- p2 in l1_4 (c1)

- t1 in l1_4 (c1)

- t2 in l2_5 (c2)

- a1 in l1_1 (c1)

- a2 in l2_1 (c2)

Plan steps:

For p1:

1. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2 (c2).

Action: drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2

2. Load p1 into t2 at l2_2.

Action: loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

3. Drive t2 to l2_1 (airport).

Action: drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2

4. Unload p1 into l2_1.

Action: unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

5. Load p1 into a2.

Action: loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

6. Fly a2 to l1_1 (c1's airport).

Action: flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

7. Unload p1 into l1_1.

Action: unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (now p1 is in l1_1, satisfying constraint 5)

8. Load p1 into t1 (drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1 first).

But t1 starts in l1_4. So need to move t1 to l1_1.

Action: drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1

9. Load p1 into t1.

Action: loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

10. Drive t1 to l1_5.

Action: drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1

11. Unload p1 into l1_5 (satisfies constraint 6).

Action: unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5

Now, to get p1 back to c2:

12. Load p1 into t1.

Action: loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5

13. Drive t1 to l1_1.

Action: drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1

14. Unload p1 into l1_1.

Action: unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

15. Load p1 into a1.

Action: loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

16. Fly a1 to l2_1 (c2's airport).

Action: flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

17. Unload p1 into l2_1.

Action: unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

18. Load p1 into t2 (drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_1? No, t2 is already in l2_1 after step 3? Wait, t2 was driven to l2_1 in step 3, then after unloading p1, it's still in l2_1. So:

After step 4, t2 is in l2_1. So steps 1-4 leave t2 in l2_1. Then step 5 is load p1 into a2. Then step 6 fly a2 to l1_1. Then steps 8-14 involve t1.

But after step 17, p1 is in l2_1. We need to load into t2 and drive to l2_5.

But t2 is in l2_1 (from step 3). So:

18. Load p1 into t2.

Action: loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

19. Drive t2 to l2_5.

Action: drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2

20. Unload p1 into l2_5 (goal).

Action: unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

Now for p2:

Parallel steps:

While handling p1, we need to handle p2.

Between steps 1-20 for p1, we can interleave p2's steps.

p2's steps:

1. Load into t1 at l1_4 (c1).

But t1 is initially in l1_4.

Action: loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (can be done early)

But after step 8, t1 is driven to l1_1. So p2's steps must be scheduled before t1 is moved.

Wait, in the p1 plan, step 8 is driving t1 to l1_1. So if we handle p2 first:

For p2:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (t1 is in l1_4)

Action: loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

2. Drive t1 to l1_2.

Action: drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1

3. Unload p2.

Action: unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (satisfies constraint 2)

4. Load p2 back into t1.

Action: loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

5. Drive t1 to l1_1.

Action: drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 (this would be step 8 in p1's plan, but now conflicting)

Wait, in p1's plan, step 8 is driving t1 to l1_1 to load p1. But if p2's step 5 is driving t1 to l1_1, then we can combine these steps.

But after loading p2 into t1 in l1_2, we need to drive t1 to l1_1, which is when t1 would be available for p1's steps.

So perhaps the plan would be:

Order of actions:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1

3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

4. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

5. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1

6. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

At this point, t1 is in l1_1. Then, for p1's step 8:

8. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_1? No, t1 is already in l1_1. But p1 is in l1_1 (after step 7). So load p1 into t1.

But wait, after step 6 for p2, p2 is unloaded in l1_1. Then, t1 is in l1_1. So for p1's step 8:

7. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (from p1's step 7)

8. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (this is p1's step 9)

9. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1 (p1's step 10)

But during this, p2 is in l1_1. Then, after moving t1 to l1_5 with p1, unload p1, then drive back to l1_1, then handle p2.

But this is getting very complex. The optimal plan requires minimizing steps, so overlapping actions where possible.

But given the time, perhaps the optimal plan is as follows:

Combined plan:

Actions:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1

3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

4. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2

5. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

6. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2

7. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

8. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

9. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

10. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

11. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

12. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1

13. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

14. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

15. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

16. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1

17. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5

18. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5

19. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1

20. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

21. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

22. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

23. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

24. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

25. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2

26. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

27. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

28. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

29. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1

30. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

But this seems very lengthy. Let's check if all constraints are met:

- p2 is in l1_2 (step 3), which is before l1_3 (step 30). Check.

- p1 is in l1_1 (step 10), l1_5 (step 17), and t1 (steps 15,18,20). Check constraints 5 and 6.

- p1 is in l2_2 initially (constraint 3), and in l1_5 (step 17). Check.

- For constraint 4: When p1 is in l2_2 (initially), p2 is in l1_4. So that's satisfied.

- p1 must be in t1 or l1_1 (step 10,15, etc.). Check.

- p2 must be in a1 (step14), which satisfies constraints 7 and 8. Also, in l1_1 (steps 13,27), satisfying constraint 9.

- p2 is in l1_5 (step 18? No, p2 is in a1 at step14, then unloaded to l1_1 at step27. Then loaded into t1 and driven to l1_3. So to satisfy p2 in l1_5, perhaps during steps for p1's movement to l1_5, we can move p2 there as well. Hmm, this seems missed. 

Wait, constraint 8 requires p2 to be in a1 or l1_5. Step14 loads p2 into a1, which satisfies constraint 8. So that's covered. 

But constraint 9 requires p2 in l1_1 or l1_5. Steps13 and 27 have p2 in l1_1. So that's covered.

Other constraints:

- p1 in l1_5 (step17). Check.

- p2 in a1 (step14). Check.

So all constraints are satisfied.

But the plan has 30 steps, which is very long. Maybe there's a shorter way.

Wait, perhaps after step14, p2 is in a1. Then, we can fly a1 to l1_5's airport? But there's no airport in l1_5. Airports are l1_1 and l2_1. So no, can't fly to l1_5. So p2 can't be flown to l1_5. To get p2 to l1_5, must use truck.

But maybe after step14 (p2 in a1), we can unload p2 into l1_1 (step27), then load into t1 and drive to l1_5 (steps28,29). But that would add steps.

Alternatively, after step14 (p2 in a1), unload into l1_1, then drive to l1_5.

But why not combine steps:

After step14, unload p2 from a1 into l1_1 (step27), then load into t1 and drive to l1_5, then unload (satisfies constraint 8 and 9).

But that's additional steps.

Alternatively, after step14 (p2 in a1), fly a1 to l1_5, but l1_5 is not an airport. So can't do that.

So, the only way is to truck p2 to l1_5.

But this makes the plan longer.

However, given the constraints, this seems necessary.

But perhaps there's a shorter path.

Wait, maybe after p2 is in l1_1 (step13), we can drive t1 to l1_5 with p2 and p1 together? But packages are separate.

Alternatively, after step13, p2 is in l1_1. Then, when we drive t1 to l1_5 for p1 (step16), we can load p2 into t1 and drive to l1_5, unload both p1 and p2. But since packages are separate, we can't load both at the same time unless we have multiple packages in the truck.

But each load/unload is per package. So maybe:

After step13 (p2 in l1_1), we load p2 into t1 (step28), drive to l1_5 (step29), unload p2 (step30), then load p1 into t1 and drive to l1_1.

But this adds steps. But this would satisfy constraint 8 (p2 in l1_5) and 9.

But this complicates the plan further.

Given the complexity, perhaps the optimal plan is as outlined earlier, but I might have missed some steps. However, considering the constraints and the required movements, this seems necessary.

But maybe there's a smarter way. Let's try to see:

For p2, after loading into a1 (step14), we can unload it back into l1_1 (step27). This satisfies constraint7 and 8. Then, load into t1 and drive to l1_5 (steps28-29), unload (step30), then drive to l1_3 (steps31-32). This adds steps but satisfies the constraints.

However, given the time constraints, I'll proceed to write the plan as per the initial outline, ensuring all constraints are met.
