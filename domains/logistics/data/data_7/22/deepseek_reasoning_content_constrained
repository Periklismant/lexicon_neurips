Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this planning problem. The goal is to get p1 to l1_1 and p2 to l1_4, right? But there are a bunch of constraints we have to satisfy along the way. Let's start by understanding the initial state and the constraints.

First, the initial state:
- p1 is in l2_5 (which is in city c2).
- p2 is in l2_2 (also c2).
- Trucks t1 is in l1_5 (c1), t2 in l2_5 (c2).
- Airplanes a1 is in l1_1 (c1's airport), a2 in l2_1 (c2's airport).

So, both packages are in city c2. The goal is to get p1 to l1_1 (which is an airport in c1) and p2 to l1_4 (a location in c1). That means we need to transport both packages from c2 to c1. Since airplanes can move between airports, maybe we can use them to transport the packages between cities.

But there are multiple constraints here. Let's list them out:

Constraints:
1. p2 must be in l2_2 at least once. (Already true initially, but since we need to move p2, maybe we have to ensure it's there again or maybe the initial state counts. Wait, the initial state is part of the plan's states, right? So maybe the initial state already satisfies that. But if we move p2 from l2_2, then maybe we have to put it back. But the problem says "must hold in at least one state", so initial state counts. But I need to check if the plan starts from the initial state, so the first state is the original state. So the first constraint is already satisfied because p2 starts in l2_2. So that's taken care of.

2. If p2 is in l2_2 in some state s, then either p2 is in l2_4 or p1 is in l1_5 at s or after. Since the initial state has p2 in l2_2, we have to ensure that either in the initial state or after, p2 is in l2_4 or p1 is in l1_5. But the initial state: p1 is in l2_5, not l1_5. So after the initial state, when we move p2 from l2_2, we need to make sure that eventually either p2 gets to l2_4 or p1 gets to l1_5.

3. p2 must be in l1_1 at least once. So at some point, p2 has to be at l1_1, which is an airport in c1.

4. If p2 is in l1_1 in state s, then in s or after, either p2 is in l2_3 or p1 is in l2_4.

5. p2 must be in l2_4 at least once.

6. At least once, either p2 is in l1_3 or p2 is in a1.

7. At least once, both p1 and p2 are in a1.

8. p2 must be in l2_1 at least once.

9. If p2 is in l2_1 in some state, there must be a prior state where either p1 is in l2_4 or p2 is in l2_5. Since p2 starts in l2_5, the initial state satisfies this. So moving p2 to l2_1 would require that before that, p2 was in l2_5 (which is true initially), so that's okay. But if we move p2 to l2_1 after moving it from l2_5, we need to check that before moving it to l2_1, there was a state where p1 was in l2_4 or p2 was in l2_5. Since the initial state has p2 in l2_5, any time after that when we move p2 to l2_1 would have the prior state (initial) where p2 was in l2_5. So that's satisfied.

10. At least once, both p1 is in t1 and p2 is in l1_2.

So, the main challenge is meeting all these constraints while getting p1 to l1_1 and p2 to l1_4.

Let's start by planning the movement of p1 and p2.

For p1: starts in l2_5 (c2). To get to l1_1 (c1's airport), we need to transport it via airplane. Since a2 is in l2_1 (c2's airport), maybe we can load p1 into a2, fly it to l1_1, then unload. But first, we need to get p1 from l2_5 to l2_1. How? Use truck t2, which is in l2_5. So:

- Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (but wait, l2_1 is an airport in c2. Are l2_5 and l2_1 in the same city? Yes, c2. So drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2. Then load p1 into t2? Wait, t2 is a truck. Wait, no: p1 is in l2_5 initially, and t2 is in l2_5. So we can load p1 into t2 at l2_5. Then drive t2 to l2_1. Then unload p1 at l2_1, then load into airplane a2. Then fly a2 to l1_1, unload p1 there.

Wait, but the goal is to have p1 in l1_1, so that would work. But we need to check constraints.

For p2: starts in l2_2 (c2). Needs to end up in l1_4 (c1). So similar approach: move p2 to l2_1 via truck, load into airplane a2, fly to l1_1, then maybe use truck t1 (which is in l1_5) to drive to l1_1, load p2, drive to l1_4, unload. But there are constraints that require p2 to be in l2_4, l1_1, l2_1, etc. Let's see.

But first, let's check the constraints that need to be met during the plan.

Constraint 2: If p2 is in l2_2 (which it is initially), then after that, in some state, p2 must be in l2_4 or p1 in l1_5. Since the initial state has p2 in l2_2, we need to ensure that after that, either p2 goes to l2_4 or p1 goes to l1_5. But p1 starts in l2_5, so getting it to l1_5 would require moving it from c2 to c1. That's part of the goal. But maybe that's too late. So maybe we need to have p2 go to l2_4 at some point.

Constraint 5: p2 must be in l2_4. So we need to move p2 to l2_4 at some point. So perhaps after moving p2 from l2_2 to somewhere else, we can have it go to l2_4.

Constraint 8: p2 must be in l2_1. So we need to get p2 to l2_1. Which is an airport in c2, so that's where airplane a2 is. So perhaps we can load p2 into a2 at l2_1 after moving it there.

Constraint 9: When p2 is in l2_1, there must have been a prior state where p1 was in l2_4 or p2 was in l2_5. Since p2 starts in l2_5, the initial state covers this. So moving p2 to l2_1 after that is okay.

Constraint 3: p2 must be in l1_1. So after flying to l1_1, we unload p2 there. But the goal is to have p2 in l1_4, so we need to move it from l1_1 to l1_4 using a truck in c1. t1 is in l1_5, so drive t1 to l1_1, load p2, drive to l1_4, unload.

Constraint 4: If p2 is in l1_1 (which it will be during the plan), then after that, either p2 is in l2_3 or p1 is in l2_4. But after p2 is in l1_1, how can we get it to l2_3 (which is in c2)? That would require moving it back to c2. But the goal is to have p2 in l1_4. So maybe during the plan, after unloading p2 in l1_1, we need to take p2 back to c2's l2_3. But that complicates things. Alternatively, maybe p1 can be moved to l2_4. But p1's goal is l1_1. So perhaps we have to arrange for p1 to be in l2_4 temporarily. Wait, p1 starts in l2_5. To get it to l2_4, we can use truck t2. So load p1 into t2 at l2_5, drive to l2_4, unload. Then later move it back. But that's adding steps. This seems complicated.

But let's think: after p2 is in l1_1 (satisfying constraint 3), we need either p2 to be in l2_3 or p1 in l2_4. So maybe after p2 is in l1_1, we can have p1 in l2_4. But how? If p1 is in l2_4, that would mean that after transporting p1 to l2_4 (from l2_5), but then we have to move it back to l2_1 to load into the airplane. That might add steps, making the plan longer. Alternatively, maybe during the transportation of p1 to l2_1 (for loading into a2), we can have a detour to l2_4. Let's see:

Original plan for p1: load into t2 at l2_5, drive to l2_1, unload, load into a2, fly to l1_1. But if instead, after loading into t2, drive to l2_4 first, unload p1 there (so p1 is in l2_4), then drive to l2_1, load into a2. This would satisfy the condition that when p2 is in l1_1, p1 is in l2_4 (since after p1 is loaded into a2 and flown to l1_1, then p1 is in l1_1. Wait, no. If we unload p1 at l2_4, then load it again into t2, drive to l2_1, then load into a2. So during the time p1 is in l2_4, that could satisfy the constraint when p2 is in l1_1. But how do these timelines overlap?

Alternatively, maybe we can have p1 in l2_4 after p2 is in l1_1. Let's think about the order.

Another approach: Since the constraints are about states occurring in the plan, maybe we can satisfy some of them during the transportation process.

For example, constraint 7: both p1 and p2 in a1. But a1 is in c1's airport l1_1. So we need to have both packages loaded into a1. But how? Because a1 is in l1_1. So perhaps after flying p1 and p2 to l1_1 via a2, then load them into a1 (but why?), but that might not be necessary. Alternatively, maybe use a1 to transport them, but a1 is in l1_1. So unless we fly a1 to l2_1, load them, and fly back. But that's possible.

Wait, airplanes can fly between any airports. So a1 is initially in l1_1. To get p1 and p2 into a1, we could fly a1 to l2_1, load both packages into a1, then fly back to l1_1. But that would require moving a1, which is in c1, to c2's airport. Let's see:

- Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
- Load p1 and p2 into a1 at l2_1.
- Fly back to l1_1.
- Unload both.

But how do p1 and p2 get to l2_1? Because p1 is in l2_5, p2 is in l2_2. So we need to get them to l2_1 using trucks.

This approach might help satisfy constraint 7 (both in a1), and also constraint 3 (p2 in l1_1), and others. Let's see.

But this seems like a longer plan. However, the problem requires an optimal plan (shortest possible). So perhaps this approach is longer than necessary.

Alternatively, using a2 (which is already in l2_1) to transport both packages to l1_1. Let's think:

For p1:

- Load into t2 at l2_5.
- Drive t2 to l2_1.
- Unload p1 at l2_1.
- Load into a2.
- Fly a2 to l1_1.
- Unload p1 into l1_1.

For p2:

- Load into t2 (but p2 is in l2_2; t2 is initially in l2_5). Wait, t2 is in l2_5. So to move p2 from l2_2 to l2_1, we need a truck in c2 that can go to l2_2. But t2 is in l2_5. So drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2 (possible, since both are in c2). Then load p2 into t2 at l2_2, drive to l2_1, unload, load into a2, fly to l1_1, unload. Then drive t1 (which is in l1_5) to l1_1, load p2, drive to l1_4, unload.

But this would handle both packages. Let's outline the steps:

1. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2 (to pick up p2).
2. Load p2 into t2 at l2_2.
3. Drive t2 to l2_1.
4. Unload p2 at l2_1.
5. Load p2 into a2.
6. Fly a2 to l1_1.
7. Unload p2 into l1_1. (This satisfies constraint 3.)
8. Now, p2 is in l1_1. According to constraint 4, after this, either p2 must go to l2_3 or p1 must be in l2_4. But p1's current location: initially in l2_5. Need to move p1 to l2_4 to satisfy this. So perhaps after moving p2 to l1_1, we handle p1.

Wait, but p1 is still in l2_5. Let's handle p1:

9. Load p1 into t2 (t2 is in l2_1 now? No, after driving to l2_1, t2 is there. But p1 is in l2_5. So perhaps we need another truck. Wait, t2 was driven to l2_2, then to l2_1. So after step 3, t2 is in l2_1. To get p1, which is in l2_5, we need to drive t2 back to l2_5? That's possible.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let's retrace.

Original plan for p2:

Steps 1-7: move p2 to l1_1.

But p1 is still in l2_5. So steps for p1:

8. Drive t2 from l2_1 back to l2_5.
9. Load p1 into t2.
10. Drive t2 to l2_1.
11. Unload p1.
12. Load p1 into a2.
13. Fly a2 to l1_1.
14. Unload p1 into l1_1.

But this would make the plan longer. However, the problem requires an optimal (shortest) plan. So maybe there's a way to combine steps.

Alternatively, after step 3 (t2 is in l2_1 with p2), perhaps we can first handle p1:

Wait, p1 is in l2_5. So after step 3, t2 is in l2_1. To get p1, we need to drive t2 back to l2_5. So:

4. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_5.
5. Load p1 into t2.
6. Drive t2 to l2_1.
7. Unload p1 at l2_1.
8. Load p1 into a2.
9. Load p2 into a2. (Wait, p2 was unloaded at l2_1 in step 4? No, the steps are getting mixed up.)

Alternatively, perhaps load both p1 and p2 into a2 in l2_1. Let me try to outline:

For p2:

1. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2. (t2 is initially in l2_5.)
2. Load p2 into t2 at l2_2.
3. Drive t2 to l2_1.
4. Unload p2 at l2_1.

For p1:

5. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_5.
6. Load p1 into t2 at l2_5.
7. Drive t2 to l2_1.
8. Unload p1 at l2_1.
9. Load both p1 and p2 into a2 at l2_1.
10. Fly a2 to l1_1.
11. Unload p1 and p2 into l1_1.

Then, to get p2 to l1_4:

12. Drive t1 (in l1_5) to l1_1.
13. Load p2 into t1.
14. Drive t1 to l1_4.
15. Unload p2.

But this would satisfy the goals. However, let's check the constraints.

Constraint 3: p2 in l1_1 (step 11).

Constraint 4: after p2 is in l1_1, either p2 is in l2_3 or p1 is in l2_4. But after step 11, p1 is in l1_1 (goal), and p2 is moved to l1_4. So unless we have p1 go to l2_4, which would require moving it back to c2, which is not part of the goal. So this approach would violate constraint 4. So we need to find a way to satisfy constraint 4.

So when p2 is in l1_1 (after step 11), we must have either p2 in l2_3 or p1 in l2_4 at that state or after. But after step 11, p1 is in l1_1 (goal), so unless we have p1 in l2_4 at some point, this won't work. Therefore, we need to arrange for p1 to be in l2_4 during the plan.

So perhaps after transporting p1 to l2_1 and before loading it into a2, we can detour to l2_4.

Let's adjust the steps:

For p1:

5. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_5.
6. Load p1 into t2 at l2_5.
7. Drive t2 to l2_4. (To drop off p1 there.)
8. Unload p1 at l2_4. (Now p1 is in l2_4, which satisfies the condition for constraint 4 when p2 is in l1_1.)
9. Load p1 into t2 again at l2_4.
10. Drive t2 to l2_1.
11. Unload p1 at l2_1.
12. Load p1 into a2.

But this adds steps. However, now, after p2 is in l1_1 (step 11), p1 was in l2_4 in step 8, which is before. But constraint 4 requires that when p2 is in l1_1 (state s), then in s or after, p2 is in l2_3 or p1 is in l2_4. If p1 was in l2_4 in a previous state (step 8) but not in s or after, that's not sufficient. So we need p1 to be in l2_4 either at the same time as p2 is in l1_1 or after.

So maybe after moving p2 to l1_1, we need to move p1 to l2_4. But p1 is supposed to end up in l1_1. So this seems conflicting. Alternatively, during the transportation of p1 to l2_1, we can have a stop at l2_4, leaving p1 there, then moving it again.

Alternatively, after unloading p1 at l1_1 (goal), can we move it back to l2_4? That would violate the goal, which requires p1 to be in l1_1 at the end.

This is a problem. So perhaps we need to have p1 in l2_4 after p2 is in l1_1. But how? Because p1 needs to end up in l1_1. So the only way is to have p1 in l2_4 after being moved to l1_1, which would require moving it back to c2, but that's not desired.

Hmm. Maybe another approach: instead of moving p2 to l1_1 directly, maybe first move it to l2_4 to satisfy constraint 5, then to l2_1, then to l1_1. Let's see:

For p2:

1. Load p2 into t2 at l2_2.
2. Drive t2 to l2_4 (satisfies constraint 5).
3. Unload p2 at l2_4.
4. Load p2 into t2 again.
5. Drive t2 to l2_1.
6. Unload p2.
7. Load into a2.
8. Fly to l1_1.
9. Unload p2.

Now, after step 9, p2 is in l1_1 (constraint 3). Now, constraint 4 requires that after this, p2 is in l2_3 or p1 is in l2_4. So maybe after this, we can have p1 in l2_4. How?

For p1:

10. Load p1 into t2 (which is in l2_5; but t2 is now in l2_1. Wait, after step 5, t2 is in l2_1. So to get p1 from l2_5, need to drive t2 back:

10. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_5.
11. Load p1 into t2.
12. Drive t2 to l2_4.
13. Unload p1 at l2_4. (Now p1 is in l2_4, satisfying constraint 4.)
14. Load p1 into t2 again.
15. Drive t2 to l2_1.
16. Unload p1.
17. Load into a2.
18. Fly to l1_1.
19. Unload p1.

Then, for p2 to get to l1_4:

20. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_1.
21. Load p2 into t1.
22. Drive to l1_4.
23. Unload p2.

This way, after p2 is in l1_1 (step 9), p1 is moved to l2_4 (step 13), satisfying constraint 4. However, this adds many steps. But maybe this is necessary to satisfy the constraints.

But the problem states that the plan must be optimal, so we need the shortest possible. Let's count the steps so far:

For p2:

1. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
2. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2
3. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
4. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
5. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
6. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
7. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
8. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
9. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

For p1:

10. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
11. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
12. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2
13. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
14. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
15. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
16. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
17. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
18. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
19. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

For p2 to l1_4:

20. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
21. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
22. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
23. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

That's 23 steps. But maybe there's a shorter way.

Let's think of combining some steps. For instance, after flying a2 to l1_1 with both packages. But a2 can carry both p1 and p2. So steps could be:

1. Move p2 to l2_1 and p1 to l2_1, load both into a2, fly to l1_1, unload both. Then move p2 to l1_4.

But how to get p1 and p2 to l2_1.

For p2:

- Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2 (since t2 starts in l2_5? Wait, no. Initial state: t2 is in l2_5. So:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

For p1:

5. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (t2 is in l2_5 initially)
Wait, no. After step 1, t2 is in l2_2. So after moving to l2_2, load p2, drive to l2_1, then drive back to l2_5 to get p1.

So steps:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
5. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
6. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
7. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
8. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
9. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
10. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
11. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
12. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
13. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
14. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
15. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
16. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
17. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

That's 17 steps. Now let's check constraints:

Constraint 3: p2 in l1_1 (step 13).

Constraint 4: after that, need p2 in l2_3 or p1 in l2_4. But p1 is in l1_1, so need to have p1 in l2_4. So maybe after step 13, we need to move p1 back to l2_4. But that's against the goal. So this approach doesn't satisfy constraint 4.

Hmm. So this is a problem. How can we satisfy constraint 4?

Alternative idea: When p2 is in l1_1 (step 13), we need to ensure that either p2 later goes to l2_3 or p1 is in l2_4. Since the goal requires p1 to stay in l1_1, the only way is to have p2 go to l2_3 after step 13. But how? That would require moving p2 back to c2, which is not part of the goal, and then moving it again to c1. But that adds steps and may not be optimal.

Alternatively, perhaps during the transportation of p1 and p2, we can have p1 visit l2_4.

For example, after step 8 (p1 in l2_1), drive t2 to l2_4, unload p1 there (step 9), then load again and drive back.

So steps:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
5. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
6. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5? No, t2 is in l2_1 after step 3. Wait, after step 3, t2 is in l2_1. So to get p1 from l2_5, we need to drive t2 back to l2_5.

Let me reorganize:

For p2:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
5. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

For p1:

6. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
7. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
8. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2
9. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (now p1 is in l2_4, satisfying constraint 4 if needed)
10. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
11. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
12. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
13. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
14. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
15. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (p2 in l1_1, constraint 3)
16. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
17. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
18. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
19. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
20. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

Now, after step 15, p2 is in l1_1. Then, in the same state, p1 is also in a2. So during the flight, both are in a2. But after unloading, p1 is in l1_1. So constraint 4 requires that after p2 is in l1_1, either p2 is in l2_3 or p1 is in l2_4. But p1 is in l1_1, so we need to have p2 go to l2_3. How?

This seems impossible unless we move p2 back. But the goal is to have p2 in l1_4. So perhaps this approach won't work.

Alternative idea: Find a way to have p1 in l2_4 after p2 is in l1_1. But how? p1 is in l1_1 (goal), so that's not possible. So perhaps the only way is to have p2 go to l2_3 after being in l1_1. But that requires:

After step 15:

21. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
22. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_3 (but l2_3 is not an airport. Wait, airports are l1_1 and l2_1. So airplanes can only fly between airports. So we can't fly to l2_3. So this is impossible.

Thus, the only way to satisfy constraint 4 is to have p1 in l2_4 after p2 is in l1_1. But p1 needs to be in l1_1 at the end. So this is impossible. Therefore, our initial approach is flawed.

We must find a different path that allows p1 to be in l2_4 after p2 is in l1_1, but that conflicts with the goal.

Wait, but constraint 4 says that if p2 is in l1_1 in state s, then in s or after, p1 must be in l2_4 or p2 in l2_3. But since p1 is in l1_1 at the end, which is after s, but p1 can't be in l2_4 after s. So the only way is for p2 to go to l2_3 after s. But that's impossible because l2_3 is in c2 and airplanes can only land at airports. So p2 can't go to l2_3 unless it's transported by truck in c2. But after p2 is in l1_1, to get it to l2_3, you'd have to fly it back to l2_1, then use a truck to drive to l2_3. But that's a lot of steps and not optimal.

This suggests that the initial plan needs to be adjusted so that when p2 is in l1_1, p1 is also in l2_4. But how?

Alternative plan: Transport p1 to l2_4 before moving it to l1_1.

For example:

1. Move p1 from l2_5 to l2_4 using t2.
2. Then move p1 to l2_1 and fly to l1_1.

But this way, when p2 is in l1_1, p1 was in l2_4 earlier. But constraint 4 requires that when p2 is in l1_1 (state s), then in s or after, p1 is in l2_4 or p2 is in l2_3. If p1 was in l2_4 before s, that doesn't count. It has to be in s or after. So unless p1 is in l2_4 after s, which is not possible because it's in l1_1, this won't work.

Hmm. This is a real problem. Maybe we need to find a different way to satisfy constraint 4.

Wait, maybe during the transportation of p2 to l1_1, p1 is in l2_4. For example:

- Transport p1 to l2_4 first.
- Then transport p2 to l1_1.
- So during the state when p2 is in l1_1, p1 is in l2_4.

But how?

Let's try:

For p1:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2 (t2 starts in l2_5)
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (wait, t2 is now in l2_4. No, after step 1, t2 is in l2_4. But p1 is in l2_5. So step 1: drive t2 to l2_5? No, t2 starts in l2_5. Wait, initial state: t2 is in l2_5. So:

1. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
2. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2
3. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (now p1 is in l2_4)
4. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
5. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (but p1 is in l2_4; wait, no. After step 3, p1 is in l2_4. To move it to l2_1, need to load it into t2 again.

4. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
5. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
6. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
7. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
8. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
9. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

For p2:

10. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2 (but after step 5, t2 is in l2_1)
11. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
12. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
13. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
14. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
15. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
16. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
17. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
18. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
19. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
20. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

Now, when p2 is unloaded at l1_1 (step 16), p1 is already in l1_1 (step 9). So constraint 4 requires that in that state or after, p2 is in l2_3 or p1 is in l2_4. But p1 is in l1_1 and p2 is moved to l1_4. So this doesn't satisfy the constraint.

But during the transportation, p1 was in l2_4 (step 3) before p2 was in l1_1. But constraint 4 requires that the condition holds in s or after. Since s is when p2 is in l1_1, and p1 was in l2_4 before, that doesn't count. Therefore, this approach fails.

This is getting very complex. Let's think differently. Maybe use a different airplane or truck.

Another constraint: constraint 7 requires both p1 and p2 to be in a1 at least once. a1 is in l1_1. So they must be loaded into a1 there. So perhaps after flying them to l1_1 via a2, we need to load them into a1. But why would we do that? Maybe:

After unloading from a2 into l1_1, load both into a1 (which is already there), then unload again. But that adds steps.

For example:

17. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
18. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
19. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
20. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

But this satisfies constraint 7 (both in a1 at step 18). Also, when p2 is in l1_1 (step 16), after that, we load them into a1 (steps 17-18), which satisfies constraint 7. Then unload. But this adds steps. Also, after p2 is in l1_1 (step 16), constraint 4 requires p2 to be in l2_3 or p1 in l2_4. Since we're not addressing that, this doesn't help.

Another constraint: constraint 6 requires p2 to be in l1_3 or in a1. If we load p2 into a1, that would satisfy it. So step 18 would satisfy that.

But we still have to handle constraint 4.

Alternatively, during the flight of a2 to l1_1, both packages are in a2. So in that state, both are in a2. But a2 is not a1. So constraint 7 requires them to be in a1.

So perhaps we need to transfer them to a1. So after arriving at l1_1 with a2, unload, then load into a1, then unload again. This would satisfy constraint 7.

But this adds steps. Let's see:

After steps 1-16 (p1 and p2 in l1_1 via a2):

17. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
18. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (now both are in a1, satisfying constraint 7)
19. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
20. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
21. then move p2 to l1_4.

This adds four more steps. Now, total steps are 21.

But we still haven't addressed constraint 4. When p2 is in l1_1 (step 16), after that, in steps 17-20, p2 is still in l1_1 (until step 18 when it's loaded into a1). So during step 16 (s), p2 is in l1_1. After that, we load it into a1 (step 18), so in state s (step 16), the condition is that either p2 is in l2_3 or p1 is in l2_4 at s or after. Since neither is true, this violates the constraint.

Thus, this approach doesn't work.

I'm starting to think that the only way to satisfy all constraints is to have a more complex plan where p1 is temporarily moved to l2_4 after p2 is in l1_1. But that would require moving p1 back to c2, which is not part of the goal, and thus increases the plan length.

Alternatively, maybe during the initial movement of p1, we can have it pass through l2_4.

For example:

1. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
2. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2
3. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (now p1 is in l2_4)
4. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
5. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
6. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
7. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
8. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
9. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

For p2:

10. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
11. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
12. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
13. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
14. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
15. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
16. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

Now, when p2 is in l1_1 (step 16), p1 is also there. Constraint 4 requires that either p2 is in l2_3 or p1 is in l2_4 at step 16 or after. But p1 was in l2_4 in step 3, which is before. So this doesn't satisfy the constraint.

But if during step 16, p1 is in l1_1, and p2 is in l1_1, how can we satisfy constraint 4? It seems impossible.

Perhaps the key is to have p1 in l2_4 at the same time as p2 is in l1_1. But that would require p1 to be in l2_4 and l1_1 at the same time, which is impossible. So the only way is to have p2 in l2_3 after being in l1_1. But how?

Wait, what if after moving p2 to l1_1, we move it back to l2_3 via truck and airplane. But that's a lot of steps. Let's try:

After step 16 (p2 in l1_1):

17. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
18. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (c2's airport)
19. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
20. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
21. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
22. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (now p2 is in l2_3, satisfying constraint 4)
23. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
24. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
25. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
26. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
27. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
28. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
29. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
30. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
31. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
32. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

This adds 16 more steps after step 16, making the total steps 32. This is clearly not optimal.

This suggests that the problem is quite complex and requires a careful sequence of actions to meet all constraints. Perhaps the optimal plan involves multiple back-and-forth movements to satisfy the constraints in passing.

Let's try to list all constraints and see which ones can be satisfied naturally:

Constraint 1: p2 in l2_2. Initially true.

Constraint 2: If p2 in l2_2, then p2 in l2_4 or p1 in l1_5. Since p2 starts in l2_2, after that, we need to move p2 to l2_4 or p1 to l1_5. Moving p2 to l2_4 satisfies this.

Constraint 5: p2 in l2_4. So moving p2 to l2_4 satisfies both constraints 2 and 5.

Constraint 3: p2 in l1_1.

Constraint 4: If p2 in l1_1, then p2 in l2_3 or p1 in l2_4. So after p2 is in l1_1, need to have p1 in l2_4.

But p1's goal is l1_1, so we need to have p1 in l2_4 during the plan before moving it to l1_1.

Constraint 6: p2 in l1_3 or in a1. So either move p2 to l1_3 or load it into a1.

Constraint 7: both p1 and p2 in a1.

Constraint 8: p2 in l2_1. Which will happen when we load it into a2.

Constraint 9: If p2 in l2_1, then prior state has p1 in l2_4 or p2 in l2_5. Since p2 starts in l2_5, moving it to l2_1 satisfies this via the initial state.

Constraint 10: p1 in t1 and p2 in l1_2. So we need to have p1 loaded into t1 and p2 in l1_2.

But t1 is in c1's l1_5. So to load p1 into t1, p1 must be in c1. But p1 starts in c2. So this requires transporting p1 to c1 first.

But the goal requires p1 to be in l1_1, so after transporting to c1, p1 is in l1_1. To have p1 in t1, we must load it into t1 in some location in c1. For example, after arriving at l1_1, drive t1 to l1_1, load p1 into t1, then unload again. But this would satisfy constraint 10 if p2 is in l1_2 during that time.

So, let's try to outline a plan that satisfies all constraints:

1. Move p2 to l2_4 to satisfy constraints 2 and 5.
2. Move p2 to l2_1 (airport), load into a2.
3. Fly a2 to l1_1, unload p2 (satisfies constraint 3).
4. Move p1 to l2_4 (satisfies constraint 4 when p2 is in l1_1).
5. Move p1 to l2_1, load into a2, fly to l1_1.
6. Now, p1 and p2 are in l1_1. To satisfy constraint 7, load both into a1.
7. To satisfy constraint 6, ensure p2 is in a1.
8. To satisfy constraint 10, drive t1 to l1_1, load p1 into t1, and have p2 in l1_2. But p2 is in l1_1. So need to move p2 to l1_2.

This is getting too convoluted. I think the optimal plan must involve:

- Transport p2 from l2_2 to l2_4 (satisfy constraints 2,5).
- Transport p2 to l2_1, fly to l1_1 (constraint 3).
- Transport p1 from l2_5 to l2_4 (constraint 4).
- Transport p1 to l2_1, fly to l1_1.
- Then move p2 to l1_4 via t1.

Additionally, during the process, ensure that p2 is in l2_1 (constraint 8), which it will be when loaded into a2.

For constraint 6: p2 in l1_3 or in a1. If we load p2 into a1 at some point, that would satisfy it. For example, after flying to l1_1 via a2, unload, then load into a1.

For constraint 7: both in a1. So after unloading from a2, load both into a1.

For constraint 10: p1 in t1 and p2 in l1_2. After p1 is in l1_1, drive t1 to l1_1, load p1 into t1. Then drive t1 to l1_2 and unload p2 there. But p2 needs to be in l1_4 at the end. So this would require moving p2 from l1_1 to l1_2, then to l1_4. But this adds steps.

Alternatively, during the transportation of p2 to l1_4, stop at l1_2 to satisfy constraint 10.

But this is getting too long. Perhaps the optimal plan is as follows, incorporating all these steps:

1. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
2. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2
3. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (satisfies constraints 2,5)
4. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
5. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
6. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
7. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (now p2 in l2_1, satisfies constraint 8)
8. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
9. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (constraint 3)
10. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
11. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
12. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2
13. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (now p1 in l2_4, satisfies constraint 4 when p2 is in l1_1)
14. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
15. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
16. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
17. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
18. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
19. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
20. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
21. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (constraint 7 satisfied)
22. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
23. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (constraint 6 satisfied as p2 is in a1)
24. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
25. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (constraint 10: p1 in t1)
26. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1 (constraint 10: p2 in l1_2?)
Wait, no. After step 23, p2 is in l1_1. To satisfy constraint 10, we need p2 in l1_2 and p1 in t1. So after step 25, p1 is in t1. Now, drive t1 to l1_2 with p1 and unload p1 there, but then we have to move p1 back to l1_1. Alternatively, move p2 to l1_2.

But this is getting too complicated. Perhaps constraint 10 can be satisfied earlier. For example, after transporting p2 to l1_1, drive t1 to l1_1, load p1 into t1, then drive to l1_2 and unload p1 there. But then we have to move p1 back to l1_1.

Alternatively, during the movement of p2 from l1_1 to l1_4, pass through l1_2.

24. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
25. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
26. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
27. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (constraint 10: p2 in l1_2 and p1 in t1? No, p1 is in l1_1. Not sure.)

This is very challenging. Given time constraints, I'll attempt to provide a step-by-step plan that addresses as many constraints as possible, ensuring each is met.
