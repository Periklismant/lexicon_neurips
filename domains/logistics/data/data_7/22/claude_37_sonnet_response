I'll analyze this planning problem step by step.

First, let me understand the initial state:
- Location l1_1 is an airport in city c1
- Locations l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5 are in city c1
- Location l2_1 is an airport in city c2
- Locations l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5 are in city c2
- Truck t1 is in location l1_5
- Truck t2 is in location l2_5
- Package p1 is in location l2_5
- Package p2 is in location l2_2
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (airport in c1)
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1 (airport in c2)

The goal is:
- Package p1 is in location l1_1
- Package p2 is in location l1_4

Now, let's look at the constraints:

1. "Package p2 is in location l2_2" must hold in at least one state
   - This is initially true, so this constraint is satisfied from the start.

2. If "Package p2 is in location l2_2" holds, then "Package p2 is in location l2_4" OR "Package p1 is in location l1_5" must hold at some point afterward
   - Since p2 starts in l2_2, we must ensure either p2 reaches l2_4 or p1 reaches l1_5 at some point.

3. "Package p2 is in location l1_1" must hold in at least one state
   - We need to bring p2 to airport l1_1 at some point.

4. If "Package p2 is in location l1_1" holds, then "Package p2 is in location l2_3" OR "Package p1 is in location l2_4" must hold at some point afterward
   - After p2 reaches l1_1, either p2 must reach l2_3 or p1 must reach l2_4.

5. "Package p2 is in location l2_4" must hold in at least one state
   - We need to bring p2 to l2_4 at some point.

6. "Package p2 is in location l1_3" OR "Package p2 is in a1" must hold in at least one state
   - p2 must either be in l1_3 or in airplane a1 at some point.

7. "Package p1 is in a1" AND "Package p2 is in a1" must hold in at least one state
   - Both packages must be in airplane a1 at the same time.

8. "Package p2 is in location l2_1" must hold in at least one state
   - We need to bring p2 to airport l2_1 at some point.

9. If "Package p2 is in location l2_1" holds, then there must be an earlier state in which "Package p1 is in location l2_4" OR "Package p2 is in location l2_5" is true
   - Before p2 reaches l2_1, either p1 must have been in l2_4 or p2 must have been in l2_5.

10. "Package p1 is in t1" AND "Package p2 is in location l1_2" must hold in at least one state
    - At some point, p1 must be in truck t1 while p2 is in location l1_2.

This is a complex problem with many constraints. Let me start by planning the movement of the packages to satisfy all constraints and eventually reach the goal.

Initial state:
- p1 in l2_5
- p2 in l2_2
- t1 in l1_5
- t2 in l2_5
- a1 in l1_1
- a2 in l2_1

Given the constraints, I'll try to construct a plan:

First, I'll think about how to satisfy constraint 5 (p2 must be in l2_4 at some point) and constraint 2 (after p2 is in l2_2, either p2 must be in l2_4 or p1 must be in l1_5).

Since p2 starts in l2_2, I can move it to l2_4 using truck t2. First, I need to move t2 from l2_5 to l2_2:
1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2
4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

Now, p2 is in l2_4, which satisfies constraint 5 and part of constraint 2.

Next, I can move p2 to l2_1 (airport in c2) to satisfy constraint 8:
5. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
6. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
7. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

For constraint 9, before p2 is in l2_1, either p1 must be in l2_4 or p2 must be in l2_5. Since p2 wasn't in l2_5 (it started in l2_2), I need to ensure p1 is in l2_4 at some point before step 7. Let's move p1:
8. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (p1 starts in l2_5, and t2 is now in l2_1)

Hmm, this doesn't work because t2 is not in l2_5 anymore. Let me rethink this.

Actually, I made a mistake in my reasoning. Let's restart the plan.

Initial state:
- p1 in l2_5
- p2 in l2_2
- t1 in l1_5
- t2 in l2_5
- a1 in l1_1
- a2 in l2_1

Let's first load p1 into t2 (since they're both in l2_5):
1. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

Now, to satisfy constraint 9, before p2 reaches l2_1, either p1 must be in l2_4 or p2 must be in l2_5. Let's move p1 to l2_4:
2. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2
3. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

Now, p1 is in l2_4, which helps satisfy constraint 9. Let's continue by moving p2 to l2_4 (to satisfy constraint 5):
4. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2
5. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
6. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2
7. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

Now, both p1 and p2 are in l2_4. Let's move them to the airport l2_1:
8. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
9. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
10. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
11. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
12. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

Now, p1 and p2 are in airport l2_1. Next, let's load them onto an airplane to move them to city c1. We'll use airplane a2 since it's already at l2_1:
13. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
14. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
15. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

Now, both p1 and p2 are in airplane a2 at airport l1_1 in city c1.

However, constraint 7 requires both p1 and p2 to be in airplane a1 at some point. This means we need to transfer them to a1. First, let's unload them:
16. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
17. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

Now, p1 and p2 are in airport l1_1. This already satisfies part of our goal (p1 is in l1_1) and constraint 3 (p2 is in l1_1).

Next, for constraint 7, we need to load both p1 and p2 into airplane a1 (which is already at l1_1):
18. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
19. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

This satisfies constraint 7 and also constraint 6 (p2 is in a1).

Now, for constraint 4, after p2 is in l1_1, either p2 must be in l2_3 or p1 must be in l2_4. Since p1 was already in l2_4 earlier in our plan, this constraint is satisfied.

Next, we need to move p2 to l1_4 to satisfy the goal. Let's first unload both packages from a1:
20. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
21. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

Now, let's move p2 to l1_4 using truck t1. First, we need to move t1 from l1_5 to l1_1:
22. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
23. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

For constraint 10, p1 must be in t1 while p2 is in l1_2. Let's plan for that:
24. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
25. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
26. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

Now, p1 is in t1 and p2 is in l1_2, which satisfies constraint 10.

Let's continue by loading p2 back into t1 and moving to l1_4:
27. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
28. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1
29. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

Now, p2 is in l1_4, which is part of our goal. Let's move p1 back to l1_1:
30. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
31. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

Wait, I notice I've skipped constraint 10. Let me check the constraints again to ensure my plan satisfies all of them.

1. "Package p2 is in location l2_2" - Satisfied initially.
2. After p2 is in l2_2, either p2 in l2_4 or p1 in l1_5 - Satisfied by steps 6 and 7 (p2 in l2_4).
3. "Package p2 is in location l1_1" - Satisfied by step 17.
4. After p2 is in l1_1, either p2 in l2_3 or p1 in l2_4 - Satisfied by earlier steps (p1 was in l2_4 at step 3).
5. "Package p2 is in location l2_4" - Satisfied by step 7.
6. "Package p2 is in location l1_3" OR "Package p2 is in a1" - Satisfied by step 19 (p2 in a1).
7. "Package p1 is in a1" AND "Package p2 is in a1" - Satisfied by steps 18 and 19.
8. "Package p2 is in location l2_1" - Satisfied by step 12.
9. Before p2 in l2_1, either p1 in l2_4 or p2 in l2_5 - Satisfied by step 3 (p1 in l2_4).
10. "Package p1 is in t1" AND "Package p2 is in location l1_2" - Satisfied by steps 24, 25, and 26.

I think my plan satisfies all constraints. Now let's verify the final goal:
- p1 is in l1_1 (satisfied by step 31)
- p2 is in l1_4 (satisfied by step 29)

So, the goal is satisfied as well.

However, I'm noticing some issues with the plan, such as the sequence of actions. Let me revise the plan to make it more coherent:

Initial state:
- p1 in l2_5
- p2 in l2_2
- t1 in l1_5
- t2 in l2_5
- a1 in l1_1
- a2 in l2_1

1. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (loading p1 into t2 in l2_5)
2. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2 (moving t2 with p1 to l2_4)
3. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (unloading p1 in l2_4, satisfying part of constraint 9)
4. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2 (moving t2 to l2_2)
5. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (loading p2 into t2 in l2_2)
6. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2 (moving t2 with p2 to l2_4)
7. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (unloading p2 in l2_4, satisfying constraint 5)
8. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (loading p1 back into t2)
9. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (loading p2 into t2)
10. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2 (moving t2 with both packages to airport l2_1)
11. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (unloading p1 at l2_1)
12. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (unloading p2 at l2_1, satisfying constraint 8)

Wait, there's an issue here. Truck t2 can only be in one location at a time, and I need to ensure the plan respects that. Let me reconsider the sequence.

Actually, the plan is coherent. t2 starts in l2_5, then moves to l2_4, then to l2_2, back to l2_4, and finally to l2_1. This is a valid sequence of locations.

Let's continue:

13. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (loading p1 into a2 at l2_1)
14. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (loading p2 into a2 at l2_1)
15. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (flying a2 with both packages to l1_1)
16. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (unloading p1 at l1_1)
17. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (unloading p2 at l1_1, satisfying constraint 3)

Now, for constraint 7, both p1 and p2 need to be in a1 at some point:
18. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (loading p1 into a1 at l1_1)
19. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (loading p2 into a1 at l1_1, satisfying constraints 6 and 7)
20. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (unloading p1 at l1_1)
21. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (unloading p2 at l1_1)

Next, we need to move t1 from l1_5 to l1_1:
22. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1

For constraint 10, p1 must be in t1 while p2 is in l1_2:
23. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (loading p1 into t1 at l1_1)
24. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (loading p2 into t1 at l1_1)
25. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1 (moving t1 with both packages to l1_2)
26. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (unloading p2 at l1_2, satisfying constraint 10)
27. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (loading p2 back into t1)
28. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1 (moving t1 with both packages to l1_4)
29. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (unloading p2 at l1_4, part of goal)
30. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 (moving t1 with p1 to l1_1)
31. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (unloading p1 at l1_1, part of goal)

Now, the final state is:
- p1 in l1_1
- p2 in l1_4
- t1 in l1_1
- t2 in l2_1
- a1 in l1_1
- a2 in l1_1

This satisfies our goal:
- Package p1 is in location l1_1
- Package p2 is in location l1_4

Let me check all constraints one more time:

1. "Package p2 is in location l2_2" - Satisfied initially (and at step 5 where p2 is loaded from l2_2).
2. After p2 is in l2_2, either p2 in l2_4 or p1 in l1_5 - Satisfied by step 7 (p2 in l2_4).
3. "Package p2 is in location l1_1" - Satisfied by step 17.
4. After p2 is in l1_1, either p2 in l2_3 or p1 in l2_4 - Satisfied by earlier step 3 (p1 was in l2_4).
5. "Package p2 is in location l2_4" - Satisfied by step 7.
6. "Package p2 is in location l1_3" OR "Package p2 is in a1" - Satisfied by step 19 (p2 in a1).
7. "Package p1 is in a1" AND "Package p2 is in a1" - Satisfied by steps 18 and 19.
8. "Package p2 is in location l2_1" - Satisfied by step 12.
9. Before p2 in l2_1, either p1 in l2_4 or p2 in l2_5 - Satisfied by step 3 (p1 in l2_4).
10. "Package p1 is in t1" AND "Package p2 is in location l1_2" - Satisfied by steps 23, 25, and 26.

All constraints are satisfied. Let me go over the final plan once more:

1. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (loading p1 into t2 in l2_5)
2. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2 (moving t2 with p1 to l2_4)
3. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (unloading p1 in l2_4, satisfying part of constraint 9)
4. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2 (moving t2 to l2_2)
5. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (loading p2 into t2 in l2_2)
6. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2 (moving t2 with p2 to l2_4)
7. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (unloading p2 in l2_4, satisfying constraint 5)
8. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (loading p1 back into t2)
9. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (loading p2 into t2)
10. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2 (moving t2 with both packages to airport l2_1)
11. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (unloading p1 at l2_1)
12. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (unloading p2 at l2_1, satisfying constraint 8)
13. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (loading p1 into a2 at l2_1)
14. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (loading p2 into a2 at l2_1)
15. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (flying a2 with both packages to l1_1)
16. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (unloading p1 at l1_1)
17. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (unloading p2 at l1_1, satisfying constraint 3)
18. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (loading p1 into a1 at l1_1)
19. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (loading p2 into a1 at l1_1, satisfying constraints 6 and 7)
20. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (unloading p1 at l1_1)
21. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (unloading p2 at l1_1)
22. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1 (moving t1 to l1_1)
23. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (loading p1 into t1 at l1_1)
24. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (loading p2 into t1 at l1_1)
25. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1 (moving t1 with both packages to l1_2)
26. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (unloading p2 at l1_2, satisfying constraint 10)
27. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (loading p2 back into t1)
28. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1 (moving t1 with both packages to l1_4)
29. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (unloading p2 at l1_4, part of goal)
30. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 (moving t1 with p1 to l1_1)
31. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (unloading p1 at l1_1, part of goal)

Wait, I realized I made an error in my understanding. The prompt states that "Package t1 is in location l1_5" and "Package t2 is in location l2_5", but t1 and t2 are trucks, not packages. Let me correct this and re-check the initial state:

- Location l1_1 is an airport in city c1
- Locations l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5 are in city c1
- Location l2_1 is an airport in city c2
- Locations l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5 are in city c2
- Truck t1 is in location l1_5
- Truck t2 is in location l2_5
- Package p1 is in location l2_5
- Package p2 is in location l2_2
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (airport in c1)
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1 (airport in c2)

Okay, my understanding was correct, and the plan should still be valid.

Let me do one more check to ensure the plan is optimal (i.e., has no unnecessary steps):

1. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 - Necessary to move p1
2. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2 - Necessary to move p1 to l2_4
3. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 - Necessary to satisfy part of constraint 9
4. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2 - Necessary to pick up p2
5. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 - Necessary to move p2
6. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2 - Necessary to move p2 to l2_4
7. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 - Necessary to satisfy constraint 5
8. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 - Necessary to move p1
9. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 - Necessary to move p2
10. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2 - Necessary to reach the airport
11. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 - Necessary to load to airplane
12. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 - Necessary to load to airplane
13. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 - Necessary to move p1 to city c1
14. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 - Necessary to move p2 to city c1
15. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 - Necessary to move to city c1
16. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 - Necessary to satisfy the goal
17. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 - Necessary to satisfy constraint 3
18. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 - Necessary to satisfy constraint 7
19. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 - Necessary to satisfy constraints 6 and 7
20. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 - Necessary to move p1
21. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 - Necessary to move p2
22. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1 - Necessary to move t1 to p1 and p2
23. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 - Necessary to move p1
24. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 - Necessary to move p2
25. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1 - Necessary to satisfy constraint 10
26. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 - Necessary to satisfy constraint 10
27. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 - Necessary to move p2
28. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1 - Necessary to satisfy the goal
29. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 - Necessary to satisfy the goal
30. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 - Necessary to move p1 to the goal
31. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 - Necessary to satisfy the goal

All steps seem necessary to satisfy the constraints and goals. So, this is the optimal plan.

Actually, I'll double-check the constraints to make sure my understanding is correct.

1. "Package p2 is in location l2_2" must hold in at least one state - This is satisfied initially, so no special action is needed.

2. After p2 is in l2_2, either p2 in l2_4 or p1 in l1_5 must hold - We satisfy this by moving p2 to l2_4.

3. "Package p2 is in location l1_1" must hold in at least one state - We satisfy this by unloading p2 from a2 at l1_1.

4. After p2 is in l1_1, either p2 in l2_3 or p1 in l2_4 must hold - We already had p1 in l2_4 earlier in the plan, so this constraint is satisfied.

5. "Package p2 is in location l2_4" must hold in at least one state - We satisfy this by unloading p2 from t2 at l2_4.

6. "Package p2 is in location l1_3" OR "Package p2 is in a1" must hold in at least one state - We satisfy this by loading p2 into a1 at l1_1.

7. "Package p1 is in a1" AND "Package p2 is in a1" must hold in at least one state - We satisfy this by loading both p1 and p2 into a1 at l1_1.

8. "Package p2 is in location l2_1" must hold in at least one state - We satisfy this by unloading p2 from t2 at l2_1.

9. Before p2 in l2_1, either p1 in l2_4 or p2 in l2_5 must hold - We already had p1 in l2_4 earlier in the plan, so this constraint is satisfied.

10. "Package p1 is in t1" AND "Package p2 is in location l1_2" must hold in at least one state - We satisfy this by having p1 in t1 and unloading p2 at l1_2.

It seems all constraints are satisfied by the plan we have.

The final plan is:

1. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (loading p1 into t2 in l2_5)
2. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2 (moving t2 with p1 to l2_4)
3. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (unloading p1 in l2_4, satisfying part of constraint 9)
4. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2 (moving t2 to l2_2)
5. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (loading p2 into t2 in l2_2)
6. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2 (moving t2 with p2 to l2_4)
7. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (unloading p2 in l2_4, satisfying constraint 5)
8. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (loading p1 back into t2)
9. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (loading p2 into t2)
10. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2 (moving t2 with both packages to airport l2_1)
11. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (unloading p1 at l2_1)
12. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (unloading p2 at l2_1, satisfying constraint 8)
13. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (loading p1 into a2 at l2_1)
14. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (loading p2 into a2 at l2_1)
15. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (flying a2 with both packages to l1_1)
16. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (unloading p1 at l1_1)
17. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (unloading p2 at l1_1, satisfying constraint 3)
18. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (loading p1 into a1 at l1_1)
19. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (loading p2 into a1 at l1_1, satisfying constraints 6 and 7)
20. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (unloading p1 at l1_1)
21. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (unloading p2 at l1_1)
22. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1 (moving t1 to l1_1)
23. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (loading p1 into t1 at l1_1)
24. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (loading p2 into t1 at l1_1)
