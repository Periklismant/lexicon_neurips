Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. The goal is to get p1 to l2_4 and p2 to l1_2, while satisfying all the constraints. Hmm, let me start by understanding the initial state and the constraints.

First, the initial state. Let's see:

- p1 is at l1_5 (city c1), p2 is at l1_1 (airport in c1). 
- Trucks t1 is at l1_2 (c1), t2 at l2_4 (c2). Airplanes a1 at l1_1 (c1's airport), a2 at l2_1 (c2's airport).

The goal is p1 at l2_4 (c2) and p2 at l1_2 (c1).

Constraints are a bit complex. Let me list them:

1. p2 must be in l1_4 at some state.
2. p2 must be in l1_2 (which is the goal, so that's covered).
3. If p2 is in l1_2 in a state, there must be an earlier state where p2 is in l1_4 or p1 is in l1_4.
4. p1 must be in l1_5 (its initial location) in some state. Since it starts there, maybe we just need to ensure that it's not moved before a certain point.
5. If p1 is in l1_5 in state s, then in s or after, either p2 is in l2_3 or l1_4.
6. At some state, p1 is in a2 or in l1_2.
7. p2 must be in l1_3 at some state.
8. p1 must be in l2_1 (c2's airport) at some state.
9. If p1 is in l2_1, there must be an earlier state where p1 was in l1_2.
10. At some state, p2 is in l2_1 or p1 is in l1_3.

So, let's plan step by step, making sure all constraints are met.

Starting with p1. To get p1 from l1_5 (c1) to l2_4 (c2). Since airplanes can move between airports, perhaps we need to transport p1 via airplane. But l1_5 is not an airport. So first, use a truck to move p1 to the airport l1_1. Then load it onto an airplane (a1?), fly to l2_1 (c2's airport), unload, then use truck t2 in c2 to take it to l2_4.

But wait, t2 is at l2_4 initially. So if we need to drive t2 to l2_1 (the airport) to pick up p1 after it's unloaded from the airplane. Wait, but l2_1 is an airport in c2. So the truck t2 is in c2's city. So, drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1, load p1 into t2, then drive back to l2_4. But that's possible.

But let's check the steps:

For p1:

1. Move p1 from l1_5 to l1_1 (airport) using truck t1. Wait, but t1 is at l1_2. So first, drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_5, load p1, drive to l1_1, unload. Then load onto airplane a1, fly to l2_1. Then in c2, use t2 to pick up p1 from l2_1 and drive to l2_4.

But wait, t2 is at l2_4. So we need to drive t2 to l2_1 (airport) first. Then load p1 into t2, then drive back to l2_4. But how?

So steps for p1:

- Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_5 (city c1). Load p1 into t1 at l1_5. Then drive t1 to l1_1. Unload p1 at l1_1. Then load p1 onto airplane a1. Fly a1 to l2_1. Then in c2, unload p1 from a1 into l2_1. Now, to get p1 to l2_4, we need t2. But t2 is at l2_4. So drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1 (can't, because cities' locations. Wait, city c2's locations are l2_1 (airport), l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5. So t2 is in c2. So to move t2 from l2_4 to l2_1, use drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2. Then load p1 into t2 at l2_1, then drive to l2_4, unload. So p1 is at l2_4.

Now, for p2. The goal is to get p2 from l1_1 to l1_2. But there's a constraint that p2 must be in l1_3 at some state, and also in l1_4. Also, the constraint that if p2 is in l1_2, there must be an earlier state where p2 is in l1_4 or p1 is in l1_4. So perhaps p2 needs to go through l1_4 and l1_3.

But how? Let's see. p2 starts at l1_1 (airport). To get to l1_2, which is in c1. So maybe use truck t1. But t1 is initially at l1_2. Wait, but if we need to move t1 to l1_1 to load p2. So perhaps:

For p2:

- Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1 (if possible). Wait, l1_1 is in c1. So drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1. Then load p2 into t1, drive to l1_2, unload. But that's the straightforward way. However, we have constraints that require p2 to be in l1_3, l1_4, etc.

So perhaps the path for p2 is l1_1 -> l1_4 -> l1_3 -> l1_2. So use t1 to move p2 through these locations.

But how? Let me outline possible steps:

1. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1 (c1). Load p2 into t1. Then drive t1 to l1_4 (via l1_2? Or direct?), unload p2 there (so p2 is in l1_4, satisfying constraint 1). Then later, pick it up again, move to l1_3, unload (satisfying constraint 7), then move to l1_2.

But also, the constraint that when p2 is in l1_2 (the goal), there must have been an earlier state where p2 was in l1_4 or p1 was in l1_4. If we take p2 through l1_4, that satisfies this.

Now, let's check the constraints one by one.

Constraints:

1. p2 in l1_4: achieved when we unload p2 there.

2. p2 in l1_2: the goal, so achieved.

3. When p2 is in l1_2, previous state must have p2 in l1_4 or p1 in l1_4. Since p1 is being moved to l2_4, unless we take a detour, p1 doesn't go through l1_4. So we need to ensure p2 is in l1_4 earlier.

4. p1 in l1_5: initially there, so as long as we don't move it before that state is recorded, but since the initial state counts, this is already satisfied.

5. If p1 is in l1_5 (which it is initially), then in that state or after, p2 must be in l2_3 or l1_4. So after moving p2 to l1_4, that condition is satisfied. Since p1 starts in l1_5, the first state is when p1 is there, and after that, when p2 is in l1_4, which should be after some actions.

6. At some state, p1 is in a2 or l1_2. So a2 is the airplane in l2_1 (c2's airport). How can p1 be in a2? Maybe if we load it into a2. But a2 is initially in l2_1. So unless we fly a2 to l1_1, load p1 into a2 there, then fly back. That's possible, but seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps during the movement of p1, it's loaded into a1 (which is in l1_1) and flown to l2_1. Then maybe transfer to a2? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the plan will involve p1 being in l1_2. But how? Since t1 is used to move p2, maybe after moving p2, t1 can take p1. Wait, p1 is initially at l1_5. So if we first move p1 using t1, but then t1 is used for p2.

Wait, the initial position of t1 is l1_2, and p1 is in l1_5. So to move p1, t1 has to drive to l1_5, load p1, then drive to l1_1. But during that time, perhaps p2 is at l1_1 (initial position). So maybe:

Let's outline the steps for both packages, considering the constraints.

First, handle p1:

1. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_5 (c1). drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_5 c1

2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5

3. Drive t1 to l1_1: drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1

4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 → now p1 is in l1_1.

5. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

6. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

7. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 → p1 is now in l2_1 (satisfies constraint 8)

Then, in c2, we need to get p1 from l2_1 to l2_4 using t2:

8. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2 (move t2 to airport)

9. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

10. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2

11. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 → p1 at goal.

Now, for p2:

p2 is at l1_1 initially. Need to get it to l1_2, but must pass through l1_4 and l1_3.

But during the movement of t1 for p1, t1 is at l1_1 after step 3, then unloads p1 there. So after step 4, t1 is at l1_1. Then, perhaps:

After step 4 (p1 unloaded at l1_1), we can use t1 to move p2.

But wait, p2 is at l1_1. So:

12. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (now t1 is at l1_1, p2 is there)

13. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1 (drive from l1_1 to l1_4 in c1)

14. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 → p2 is here (satisfies constraint 1)

15. Now, need to get p2 to l1_3. So load p2 again:

    loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

16. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1

17. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 → satisfies constraint 7

18. Then, drive to l1_2:

    loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

    drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1

    unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 → goal achieved.

But wait, after step 17, p2 is unloaded at l1_3. Then we need to load it again into t1 (which is at l1_3), drive to l1_2, unload.

But let's check the steps and constraints.

Now, let's check constraints:

- Constraint 3: when p2 is in l1_2 (step 18's unload), there must be an earlier state where p2 is in l1_4 (step 14) or p1 is in l1_4. Since step 14 happens before, this is satisfied.

- Constraint 5: p1 is in l1_5 initially. So in the initial state, that's true. Then, after that, p2 is moved to l1_4 (step 14), which satisfies the condition that after s (initial state), p2 is in l1_4. So that's okay.

- Constraint 6: at some state, p1 is in a2 or l1_2. In step 7, p1 is in l2_1 (unloaded from a1). Then in step 9, loaded into t2. So how does p1 get into a2? It doesn't. So unless another approach is needed. Wait, this is a problem. Because constraint 6 requires that at some state, p1 is in a2 or in l1_2. 

In our current plan, p1 is never in a2 or l1_2. So this constraint is not satisfied. So we need to adjust the plan.

Hmm. How can we get p1 into a2 or l1_2?

Option 1: Have p1 loaded into a2. But a2 is in l2_1 (c2's airport). So if we fly a2 to l1_1, load p1, then fly back. But that would require:

But a2 starts at l2_1. So fly a2 to l1_1 (but can airplanes fly between any airports? Yes, as per flyairplane action. So:

flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1

unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 → now p1 is in l2_1, and in a2 during transport. But this would satisfy constraint 6, as p1 is in a2 during that step.

But integrating this into the plan would require adjusting steps for p1.

Alternative approach:

Instead of using a1 to fly p1 to l2_1, use a2. But a2 is at l2_1 initially. So we need to fly a2 to l1_1 first.

So:

After step 4 (p1 is at l1_1), instead of loading into a1, perhaps:

5. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

6. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

7. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1

8. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 → now p1 is in l2_1, and was in a2 (satisfies constraint 6).

Then proceed with t2 steps as before.

But this adds steps, but maybe necessary.

But then, the steps would be:

For p1:

1. t1 drives to l1_5, loads p1.

2. drives to l1_1, unloads p1.

3. fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.

4. load p1 into a2.

5. fly a2 back to l2_1.

6. unload p1.

Then use t2 to move to l2_4.

This way, during step 4, p1 is in a2, satisfying constraint 6.

But this requires a2 to fly to l1_1 and back. Is that feasible?

Let me check the steps again.

Original steps for p1 (adjusted):

1. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_5 c1

2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5

3. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1

4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 → p1 at l1_1.

5. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 → a2 moves to l1_1.

6. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 → p1 now in a2.

7. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1 → a2 returns.

8. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 → p1 at l2_1.

Then, t2 steps:

9. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2

10. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

11. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2

12. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 → done.

Now, this plan includes p1 being in a2 (step 6-7), satisfying constraint 6.

But also, step 8 requires that when p1 is in l2_1, there's an earlier state where p1 was in l1_2. Wait, constraint 9 says: if p1 is in l2_1, then earlier state where p1 is in l1_2. But in this plan, p1 was never in l1_2. So this violates constraint 9.

Oh right, constraint 9: if p1 is in l2_1, then there's an earlier state where p1 was in l1_2.

But in our current plan, p1 was moved from l1_5 to l1_1 via t1, then to l2_1. So p1 never was in l1_2. So this violates constraint 9.

So we need to adjust the plan so that p1 is in l1_2 at some point before being in l2_1.

How can we do that? Maybe have p1 go through l1_2.

For example, after moving p1 to l1_1, drive t1 to l1_2, unload p1 there. Then load into a different truck, but maybe not. Wait, let's think.

Alternative plan for p1:

1. t1 starts at l1_2. Drive to l1_5 (load p1), drive to l1_1 (unload), fly to l2_1 via a2, but p1 needs to have been in l1_2.

Alternatively, after moving p1 to l1_1, perhaps take it back to l1_2 with t1, then fly.

Wait, but that would add steps.

So perhaps:

After step 3 (t1 at l1_1 with p1), unload p1 at l1_1. Then drive t1 to l1_2 (drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1). Then load p1 into t1 again (since p1 is in l1_1, and t1 is at l1_2. No, that's not possible. So we need to find a way to get p1 to l1_2.

Alternative approach: Instead of taking p1 directly from l1_5 to l1_1, take it through l1_2.

So:

1. t1 drives from l1_2 to l1_5 (c1).

2. load p1 into t1 at l1_5.

3. drive t1 to l1_2 (c1).

4. unload p1 at l1_2 → p1 now in l1_2 (satisfies constraint 6? Because constraint 6 requires p1 in a2 or l1_2. So step 4 satisfies that. Then, from l1_2, move p1 to l1_1 via t1.

Wait, but how:

After step 4 (p1 at l1_2), load into t1 again:

5. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2

6. drive t1 to l1_1.

7. unload p1 at l1_1.

Then proceed with flying via a2.

But this way, p1 is in l1_2 (step 4), satisfying constraint 6. Also, when p1 is later in l2_1 (after flying), we have an earlier state (step 4) where p1 was in l1_2, satisfying constraint 9.

This seems better.

So adjusted steps for p1:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_5 c1

2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5

3. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_2 c1

4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 → p1 at l1_2 (satisfies constraint 6)

Now, p1 is in l1_2. Then, to move it to l1_1:

5. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2

6. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1

7. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 → p1 at l1_1

Then fly a2 to l1_1:

8. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

9. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

10. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1

11. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 → p1 at l2_1 (satisfies constraint 8)

Now, constraint 9 is satisfied because before step 11 (p1 at l2_1), step 4 had p1 at l1_2.

Then, use t2 to move p1 to l2_4:

12. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2

13. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

14. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2

15. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 → goal achieved.

Now, let's check constraints again.

Constraints:

6. p1 in l1_2 (step 4) → satisfied.

8. p1 in l2_1 (step 11) → satisfied.

9. p1 in l2_1 requires earlier state in l1_2 → step 4 → satisfied.

Now, for p2:

p2 is initially at l1_1. Need to get to l1_2, but must go through l1_4 and l1_3.

But after step 7 (p1 unloaded at l1_1), t1 is at l1_1. So we can use t1 to move p2.

Steps for p2:

16. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

17. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

18. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 → satisfies constraint 1.

19. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

20. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1

21. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 → satisfies constraint 7.

22. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

23. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1

24. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 → goal achieved.

Now, check other constraints:

Constraint 3: when p2 is in l1_2 (step 24), previous state had p2 in l1_4 (step 18) → satisfied.

Constraint 5: if p1 is in l1_5 (initial state), then after that, p2 is in l1_4 (step 18) → satisfies the condition.

Constraint 10: at some state, p2 is in l2_1 or p1 is in l1_3. In our current plan, p1 is never in l1_3. p2 is in l1_3 (step 21). So p1 is not in l1_3. But p2 is in l1_3. So the condition is "p2 in l2_1 OR p1 in l1_3". Wait, no. The condition is "At least one of: p2 in l2_1, p1 in l1_3". Since p2 is in l1_3 (step 21), that's not the same as l2_1. So this constraint is not satisfied. Oops, that's a problem.

Wait, the constraint says: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "At least one of the following conditions is true: "Package p2 is in location l2_1", "Package p1 is in location l1_3""

In our current plan, p2 is in l1_3 (step 21), but the condition requires p2 in l2_1 or p1 in l1_3. So neither of these is true. Wait, p2 is in l1_3, which is different from l2_1. So the constraint is not satisfied.

So we need to have either p2 in l2_1 or p1 in l1_3.

How can we achieve this?

Option 1: Have p1 in l1_3 at some point. But in the current plan, p1 is moved from l1_2 to l1_1, then flown to l2_1. So it's not passing through l1_3.

Option 2: Have p2 in l2_1. How? That would require moving p2 from c1 to c2, which is possible via airplane. But p2's goal is in c1 (l1_2). So this would involve moving p2 to c2 and back, which complicates the plan.

Alternatively, maybe during the movement of a1 or a2, p2 could be loaded into an airplane. But given the initial positions, p2 is in l1_1 (airport in c1), and a1 is there. So perhaps:

After moving p2 to l1_1 (original position), load it into a1 and fly to l2_1, then unload (p2 in l2_1), satisfying constraint 10. But then we need to bring it back to c1. But that's extra steps.

Alternatively, after step 18 (p2 in l1_4), load it into t1 and drive to l1_3, then unload (step 21). Then, instead of proceeding to l1_2, maybe take p2 to l1_1 and fly to l2_1.

But this would complicate the plan. Let's think:

Alternative steps for p2 after step 18 (p2 in l1_4):

19. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

20. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1

21. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 → p2 back at l1_1.

22. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

23. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

24. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 → p2 in l2_1 (satisfies constraint 10)

Then, to get p2 back to c1:

25. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

26. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

27. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 → p2 back in l1_1.

Then proceed to move to l1_4, l1_3, l1_2 as before.

But this adds many steps and may conflict with other constraints.

Alternatively, perhaps during the movement of p1, there's a way to have p1 in l1_3. For example, after step 4 (p1 in l1_2), maybe drive t1 to l1_3, unload p1 there, then load again and proceed.

But that would require:

After step 4 (p1 in l1_2):

5. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2

6. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1

7. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 → p1 in l1_3 (satisfies constraint 10)

Then continue moving p1 to l1_1.

This way, p1 is in l1_3 at step 7, satisfying constraint 10.

But how does that fit into the plan:

Original steps for p1 (with this adjustment):

1. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_5 c1

2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5

3. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_2 c1

4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 → p1 in l1_2.

5. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2

6. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1

7. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 → p1 here.

8. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3

9. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1

10. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 → p1 at l1_1.

Then proceed with flying via a2.

This adds steps but ensures p1 is in l1_3 (step 7), satisfying constraint 10.

Now, constraint 10 is satisfied.

But then, p2's movement needs to be adjusted.

Now, after step 10, t1 is at l1_1. Then, for p2:

11. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

12. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

13. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 → constraint 1.

14. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

15. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1

16. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 → constraint 7.

17. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

18. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1

19. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 → goal.

Now, constraint 10 is satisfied at step 7 (p1 in l1_3).

But we also need to ensure other constraints.

But let's check again:

Constraint 10 requires that in some state, p2 is in l2_1 or p1 is in l1_3. We have p1 in l1_3 at step 7 → satisfied.

Other constraints:

- Constraint 8: p1 in l2_1. When we fly p1 to l2_1, yes.

- Constraint 9: p1 in l2_1 (step say 15 after flying) requires earlier state where p1 was in l1_2. Which is step 4 → yes.

So this seems to work.

But this makes the plan longer. However, the user requires an optimal plan (shortest possible). So maybe there's a better way.

Alternative approach to satisfy constraint 10 without adding steps for p1:

Maybe during p2's movement, move p2 to l2_1. For example:

After p2 is at l1_1 (initial), load into a1, fly to l2_1, unload (p2 in l2_1), then fly back. But this adds steps but satisfies constraint 10.

But p2's goal is in l1_2, so we have to get it back.

But this would be:

Steps for p2:

1. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

2. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

3. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 → p2 in l2_1 (satisfies constraint 10)

Then, load into a2 and fly back:

4. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

5. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

6. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 → p2 back at l1_1.

Then proceed with truck movement as before.

But this adds 6 steps. Not optimal.

Alternatively, during p1's flight, perhaps p2 is loaded into a2 at l2_1. But p2 is in c1, so not possible.

Hmm. This is getting complex. Let's try to find the minimal steps.

Current plan with p1 going through l1_3 adds steps but satisfies constraints. Let's see how many steps that plan would take.

For p1:

1. Drive t1 to l1_5.

2. Load p1.

3. Drive to l1_2.

4. Unload p1 (now in l1_2).

5. Load p1.

6. Drive to l1_3.

7. Unload p1 (satisfies constraint 10).

8. Load p1.

9. Drive to l1_1.

10. Unload p1.

Then fly to l2_1:

11. Fly a2 to l1_1.

12. Load p1 into a2.

13. Fly to l2_1.

14. Unload p1.

Then move via t2:

15. Drive t2 to l2_1.

16. Load p1.

17. Drive to l2_4.

18. Unload.

Total steps for p1: 18 actions.

For p2:

19. Load p2 into t1 (at l1_1).

20. Drive to l1_4.

21. Unload p2 (satisfies constraint 1).

22. Load p2.

23. Drive to l1_3.

24. Unload p2 (satisfies constraint 7).

25. Load p2.

26. Drive to l1_2.

27. Unload (goal).

Total steps for p2: 9 actions.

Total steps: 27. But maybe some steps can be merged or ordered better.

Wait, the actions for p1 and p2 can be interleaved. For example, after step 4 (p1 in l1_2), start moving p2 while moving p1.

But given the dependencies, perhaps not. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps after p1 is in l1_2 (step 4), we can start moving p2, but need to ensure that t1 is available.

But in the current plan, t1 is used for both p1 and p2. So the steps must be sequential.

This makes the plan longer. But perhaps there's a more optimal way.

Alternative idea: Use airplane a1 to transport p2 to l2_1 briefly to satisfy constraint 10, then bring it back.

For example:

After p2 is in l1_1 (initial state), load into a1, fly to l2_1, unload, then fly back.

Steps:

1. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

2. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

3. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 → p2 in l2_1 (satisfies constraint 10)

4. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (assuming a2 is there)

5. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

6. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 → p2 back.

Then proceed to move p2 via truck.

But this adds 6 steps. However, this allows p2 to be in l2_1, satisfying constraint 10 without affecting p1's path.

But this is 6 steps added. The total plan length would be longer. But perhaps it's necessary.

Comparing the two options:

Option 1: Adjust p1's path to go through l1_3 (adding 4 steps) → total steps for p1: 18, p2: 9 → total 27.

Option 2: Add steps for p2 to fly to l2_1 and back (6 steps) → total steps would be p1's original plan (15 steps) plus p2's 9 steps plus 6 → 30.

Option 1 seems better, but is it optimal?

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to combine some actions.

Wait, maybe after p1 is unloaded at l1_3 (step 7), we can use t1 to move p2 while p1 is there. But not sure.

Alternatively, use another truck. Wait, there's t1 in c1 and t2 in c2. But t2 is in c2 and can't be used in c1. So only t1 can move p2 in c1.

So the steps must be sequential.

Hmm. Given the constraints, perhaps the first option with p1 going through l1_3 is necessary to satisfy constraint 10. So the plan would be as follows:

Plan steps:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_5 c1

2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5

3. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_2 c1

4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2

5. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2

6. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1

7. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3

8. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3

9. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1

10. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

11. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

12. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

13. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1

14. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

15. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2

16. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

17. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2

18. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

19. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

20. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

21. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

22. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

23. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1

24. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

25. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

26. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1

27. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

This plan has 27 steps. But is it optimal? Maybe there's a shorter way.

Let me see if any steps can be optimized.

For example, after step 4, p1 is in l1_2. To get to l1_3, steps 5-7: load, drive, unload. Then steps 8-10 to get to l1_1.

Alternatively, after step 4, can we drive t1 to l1_3 directly, but p1 is not in the truck. No, because after step 4, p1 is unloaded at l1_2.

So steps are necessary.

Alternative idea: After step 4 (p1 in l1_2), use a different truck to move p1. But there's only t1 in c1.

No, t2 is in c2. So no.

Another idea: Maybe use airplane a1 to move p1 from l1_2. But l1_2 is not an airport. So can't load airplane there.

So no.

Thus, this seems to be the minimal steps required to satisfy all constraints.

Let's check all constraints again with this plan:

1. p2 in l1_4: step 21 → yes.

2. p2 in l1_2: step 27 → yes.

3. When p2 is in l1_2 (step 27), earlier state has p2 in l1_4 (step 21) → yes.

4. p1 in l1_5: initial state → yes.

5. If p1 is in l1_5 (initial state), then after that, p2 is in l1_4 (step 21) → yes.

6. p1 in a2 or l1_2: p1 in l1_2 (step 4) → yes.

7. p2 in l1_3: step 24 → yes.

8. p1 in l2_1: step 14 → yes.

9. When p1 is in l2_1 (step 14), earlier state in l1_2 (step 4) → yes.

10. At some state, p2 in l2_1 or p1 in l1_3: p1 in l1_3 (step 7) → yes.

All constraints are satisfied.

Now, check if this plan is optimal. Are there any redundant steps?

For example, after step 7 (p1 in l1_3), we load it again and drive to l1_1. Is there a way to avoid this?

Alternatively, after step 7, could we fly p1 from l1_3? But l1_3 is not an airport. So no.

Thus, steps 8-10 are necessary.

Similarly, steps for p2 seem necessary to pass through l1_4 and l1_3.

This seems to be the minimal steps required. Therefore, the plan is optimal.
