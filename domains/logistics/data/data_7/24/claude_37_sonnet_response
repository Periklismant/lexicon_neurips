Alright, so I'm given a logistics planning problem with packages, trucks, airplanes, and cities. Let's start by understanding the initial state and the goal:

Initial State:
- Location l1_1 to l1_5 are in city c1
- Location l2_1 to l2_5 are in city c2
- Truck t1 is in location l1_3 (city c1)
- Truck t2 is in location l2_3 (city c2)
- Package p1 is in location l2_1 (city c2)
- Package p2 is in location l2_1 (city c2)
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (city c1, which is an airport)
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1 (city c2, which is an airport)

Goal:
- Package p1 should be in location l2_1
- Package p2 should be in location l2_2

Constraints:
1. At some point, p2 must be in l2_1 (initially it is in l2_1, so this constraint is satisfied)
2. If p2 is in l2_1, then p1 must be in l2_4 at the same time or later
3. At some point, p2 must be in l2_2 (part of the goal)
4. If p2 is in l2_2, then earlier, p2 should have been in l2_3 or p1 should have been in l2_2
5. At some point, p2 must be in l1_3
6. At some point, p1 must be in t2 and p2 in l2_4
7. At some point, p1 or p2 must be in a2
8. At some point, p2 must be in l2_3 and p1 in t1
9. At some point, p2 must be in l2_4

Let me analyze the constraints more methodically:

Constraint 1: p2 must be in l2_1 at some point - Satisfied by the initial state

Constraint 2: If p2 is in l2_1, then p1 must be in l2_4 at the same time or later - Since p2 is already in l2_1, we need to make sure p1 is in l2_4 sometime during the plan

Constraint 3: p2 must be in l2_2 at some point - This is consistent with our goal, p2 must end up in l2_2

Constraint 4: If p2 is in l2_2, then earlier, p2 should have been in l2_3 or p1 should have been in l2_2 - This means either we need to move p2 to l2_3 before moving it to l2_2, or we need to move p1 to l2_2 before moving p2 to l2_2.

Constraint 5: p2 must be in l1_3 at some point - This means p2 must move to city c1, specifically to location l1_3

Constraint 6: At some point, p1 must be in t2 and p2 in l2_4 - This means we need to load p1 on truck t2 and have p2 at location l2_4 at the same time.

Constraint 7: At some point, p1 or p2 must be in a2 - This means we need to load either p1 or p2 on airplane a2 at some point.

Constraint 8: At some point, p2 must be in l2_3 and p1 in t1 - This requires coordinating the positions of both packages. p2 must be in l2_3 and p1 must be loaded in truck t1.

Constraint 9: p2 must be in l2_4 at some point - This is consistent with Constraint 6, which already specifies p2 must be in l2_4 at some point.

Now, let's sketch a high-level plan:

1. Since p1 is already in l2_1 (airport), we can keep it there temporarily.
2. Since p2 is already in l2_1 and we have constraint 2 requiring p1 to be in l2_4 now or later, we need to move p1 to l2_4 at some point.
3. Given constraint 8, we need to load p1 on truck t1 (which is in l1_3 initially) while p2 is in l2_3. This means we need to move p1 to city c1 first (via an airplane), then load it into t1, and also move p2 to l2_3.
4. Given constraint 5, p2 must be in l1_3 at some point, which means p2 must also move to city c1, specifically to l1_3.
5. Given constraint 6, we need p1 in t2 and p2 in l2_4 at the same time. So after moving p1 back to city c2, we need to load it onto t2, and simultaneously have p2 at l2_4.
6. Given constraint 7, we must have either p1 or p2 in a2 at some point. Since a2 is already at l2_1 and both packages are there too, it would be easier to satisfy this constraint by loading one of the packages onto a2.
7. Given constraint 4, if p2 is in l2_2 (final goal), then either p2 was in l2_3 earlier, or p1 was in l2_2 earlier. We already have to move p2 to l2_3 for constraint 8, so this constraint will be satisfied.
8. Final goal requires p1 to be in l2_1 and p2 to be in l2_2.

Let's work out a detailed plan:

Starting state:
- p1 and p2 are both in l2_1
- t1 is in l1_3, t2 is in l2_3
- a1 is in l1_1, a2 is in l2_1

1. Load p1 into a2 at l2_1 (satisfies constraint 7)
2. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1
3. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1
4. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1
5. Load p1 into t1 at l1_1
6. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_3 (now p1 is in t1 at l1_3)

7. Load p2 into a2 at l2_1
8. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1
9. Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1
10. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1
11. Load p2 into t1 at l1_1
12. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_3
13. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_3 (now p2 is in l1_3, satisfying constraint 5)

14. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1
15. Load p2 into t1 at l1_3 (p2 back into t1)
16. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1
17. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1
18. Load p2 into a1 at l1_1
19. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1
20. Unload p2 from a1 at l2_1

21. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_3
22. Load p2 into t2 at l2_1
23. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_3
24. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_3 (now p2 is in l2_3, partial satisfaction of constraint 8)

25. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_3 (now p1 is in l1_3)
26. Load p1 into t1 at l1_3 (p1 is in t1 at l1_3, combined with p2 in l2_3, this satisfies constraint 8)
27. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1
28. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1
29. Load p1 into a1 at l1_1
30. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1
31. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1
32. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_4
33. Load p1 into t2 at l2_1
34. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4
35. Load p2 into t2 at l2_3
36. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_4
37. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_4 (now p2 is in l2_4, satisfying constraint 9)
38. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_2
39. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_4 (now p1 is in l2_4, combined with p2 already having been in l2_1, this satisfies constraint 2)

40. Load p2 into t2 at l2_4
41. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_2
42. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_2 (now p2 is in l2_2, satisfying constraint 3)

43. Load p1 into t2 at l2_4 (now p1 is in t2 and p2 is in l2_4, satisfying constraint 6... Wait, that's wrong. We would need p1 in t2 and p2 in l2_4 simultaneously)

Let me rethink this. There are some issues with the plan. Let me restructure it:

Hmm, I'm finding it a bit complex due to the multiple constraints. Let me approach it differently by focusing on one package at a time.

For p1:
- We need to move p1 to l2_4 (constraint 2)
- We need to load p1 into t1 (constraint 8)
- We need to load p1 into t2 (constraint 6)
- The goal requires p1 to be in l2_1 (where it already is)

For p2:
- We need to keep p2 in l2_1 initially (constraint 1)
- We need to move p2 to l2_3 (constraint 8)
- We need to move p2 to l1_3 (constraint 5)
- We need to move p2 to l2_4 (constraint 6 and 9)
- The goal requires p2 to be in l2_2

Let's try again with a more structured approach:

1. Initially, p1 and p2 are in l2_1, satisfying constraint 1
2. Load p2 into t2 at l2_1
3. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_3
4. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_3 (now p2 is in l2_3)
5. Load p1 into a2 at l2_1 (satisfies constraint 7)
6. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1
7. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1
8. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1
9. Load p1 into t1 at l1_1
10. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_3 (now p1 is in t1 at l1_3 and p2 is in l2_3, satisfying constraint 8)
11. Load p2 into t2 at l2_3
12. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_4
13. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_4 (now p2 is in l2_4, satisfying constraint 9)
14. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_3
15. Load p2 into a2 at l2_4 (we're trying to move p2 to l1_3 as per constraint 5)
16. Fly a2 from l2_4 to l1_1 (can't fly from l2_4, only from airports, fly from l2_1 to l1_1)

Hmm, I'm making a mistake with the airplane logic. Let me restart with a clearer understanding of which locations are airports:

Airports:
- l1_1 is an airport in city c1
- l2_1 is an airport in city c2

1. Initially, p1 and p2 are in l2_1 (an airport), satisfying constraint 1
2. Load p2 into t2 at l2_1
3. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_3
4. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_3 (now p2 is in l2_3)
5. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1 (to prepare for receiving p1)
6. Load p1 into a2 at l2_1 (satisfies constraint 7)
7. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1
8. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1
9. Load p1 into t1 at l1_1
10. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_3 (now p1 is in t1 at l1_3 and p2 is in l2_3, satisfying constraint 8)
11. Load p2 into t2 at l2_3
12. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_4
13. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_4 (now p2 is in l2_4, satisfying constraint 9)
14. Load p1 into t2 at l1_3 (we need to get p1 to t2 while p2 is in l2_4 for constraint 6)

Wait, that's still wrong. t2 is in city c2 and p1 is in city c1. Let me reconsider the constraint 6: at some point, p1 must be in t2 and p2 in l2_4.

Ok, I'm getting a bit confused with the multiple constraints and the movement of packages. Let me restart with a clearer focus and work out the entire plan step by step, making sure each constraint is satisfied.

Initial state:
- p1 and p2 are both in l2_1
- t1 is in l1_3, t2 is in l2_3
- a1 is in l1_1, a2 is in l2_1

Ultimate goal: p1 in l2_1, p2 in l2_2

Alright, let's work backwards from the goal and see what constraints must be satisfied:

Given the goal, p1 must be in l2_1 (already is) and p2 must be in l2_2.

Constraint 4 says that if p2 is in l2_2, then earlier, p2 should have been in l2_3 or p1 should have been in l2_2. Given the initial locations, it's easier to move p2 to l2_3 first (which also satisfies constraint 8 partially).

Constraint 8 says that at some point, p2 must be in l2_3 and p1 in t1. So, after getting p2 to l2_3, we need to make sure p1 is in t1 at that time.

Constraint 5 says p2 must be in l1_3 at some point. So, p2 needs to move from city c2 to city c1, specifically to location l1_3.

Constraint 6 says that at some point, p1 must be in t2 and p2 in l2_4. So, p1 must be loaded onto t2, and p2 must be in l2_4 at the same time.

Constraint 9 says p2 must be in l2_4 at some point, which is consistent with constraint 6.

Constraint 2 says that if p2 is in l2_1, then p1 must be in l2_4 at the same time or later. Initially, p2 is in l2_1, so we need to make sure p1 is in l2_4 sometime during the plan.

Constraint 7 says at some point, p1 or p2 must be in a2. 

Ok, let's sketch a plan:

1. Initially, p1 and p2 are both in l2_1, satisfying constraint 1.
2. Load p1 into a2 at l2_1 (satisfies constraint 7).
3. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1.
4. Load p2 into t2 at l2_1.
5. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_3.
6. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_3 (now p2 is in l2_3, partially satisfying constraint 8).
7. Fly a2 (with p1) from l2_1 to l1_1.
8. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1.
9. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1.
10. Load p1 into t1 at l1_1.
11. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_3 (now p1 is in t1 at l1_3, with p2 in l2_3, this satisfies constraint 8).
12. Load p2 into t2 at l2_3.
13. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_4.
14. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_4 (now p2 is in l2_4, satisfying constraint 9).
15. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_3.
16. Load p2 into a1 at l2_4 (wait, that's not possible, we can only load packages into airplanes at airports).

Ok, I'm making the mistake of forgetting that airplanes can only be at airports (l1_1 and l2_1). Let me try again:

1. Initially, p1 and p2 are both in l2_1, satisfying constraint 1.
2. Load p1 into a2 at l2_1 (satisfies constraint 7).
3. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1.
4. Load p2 into t2 at l2_1.
5. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_3.
6. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_3 (now p2 is in l2_3, partially satisfying constraint 8).
7. Fly a2 (with p1) from l2_1 to l1_1.
8. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1.
9. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1.
10. Load p1 into t1 at l1_1.
11. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_3 (now p1 is in t1 at l1_3, with p2 in l2_3, this satisfies constraint 8).
12. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_3.
13. Load p2 into t2 at l2_3.
14. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1 (the airport).
15. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1.
16. Load p2 into a1 at l2_1.
17. Fly a1 (with p2) from l2_1 to l1_1.
18. Unload p2 from a1 at l1_1.
19. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1.
20. Load p2 into t1 at l1_1.
21. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_3.
22. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_3 (now p2 is in l1_3, satisfying constraint 5).
23. Load p2 into t1 at l1_3.
24. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1.
25. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1.
26. Load p2 into a1 at l1_1.
27. Fly a1 (with p2) from l1_1 to l2_1.
28. Unload p2 from a1 at l2_1.
29. Load p1 into a1 at l1_3 (wait, a1 is at l2_1, not l1_3).

I'm being sloppy here...ok, a1 is in l1_1 and p1 is in l1_3. Let me fix the current plan:

1. Initially, p1 and p2 are both in l2_1, satisfying constraint 1.
2. Load p1 into a2 at l2_1 (satisfies constraint 7).
3. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1.
4. Load p2 into t2 at l2_1.
5. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_3.
6. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_3 (now p2 is in l2_3, partially satisfying constraint 8).
7. Fly a2 (with p1) from l2_1 to l1_1.
8. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1.
9. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1.
10. Load p1 into t1 at l1_1.
11. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_3 (now p1 is in t1 at l1_3, with p2 in l2_3, this satisfies constraint 8).
12. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_3.
13. Load p2 into t2 at l2_3.
14. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1 (the airport).
15. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1.
16. Load p2 into a1 at l2_1 (wait, a1 is in l1_1 not l2_1. Let's have a2 fly back to pickup p2).

Ok, we have a bit of a juggling act to do with the airplanes. Let's rethink this:

1. Initially, p1 and p2 are both in l2_1, satisfying constraint 1.
2. Load p1 into a2 at l2_1 (satisfies constraint 7).
3. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1.
4. Load p2 into t2 at l2_1.
5. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_3.
6. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_3 (now p2 is in l2_3, partially satisfying constraint 8).
7. Fly a2 (with p1) from l2_1 to l1_1.
8. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1.
9. Fly a2 from l1_1 back to l2_1.
10. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1.
11. Load p1 into t1 at l1_1.
12. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_3 (now p1 is in t1 at l1_3, with p2 in l2_3, this satisfies constraint 8).
13. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_3.
14. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1.
15. Load p2 into t2 at l2_3.
16. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_4.
17. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_4 (now p2 is in l2_4, satisfying constraint 9).
18. Load p1 into a1 at l1_3. (Wait, a1 is at l1_1 not l1_3).

Alright, i'm being sloppy again. Moving airplanes to current locations of packages:

1. Initially, p1 and p2 are both in l2_1, satisfying constraint 1.
2. Load p1 into a2 at l2_1 (satisfies constraint 7).
3. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1.
4. Load p2 into t2 at l2_1.
5. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_3.
6. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_3 (now p2 is in l2_3, partially satisfying constraint 8).
7. Fly a2 (with p1) from l2_1 to l1_1.
8. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1.
9. Fly a2 from l1_1 back to l2_1.
10. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1.
11. Load p1 into t1 at l1_1.
12. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_3 (now p1 is in t1 at l1_3, with p2 in l2_3, this satisfies constraint 8).
13. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_3.
14. Load p2 into t2 at l2_3.
15. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_4.
16. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_4 (now p2 is in l2_4, satisfying constraint 9).
17. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1.
18. Load p1 into t1 at l1_3.
19. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1.
20. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1.
21. Load p1 into a1 at l1_1.
22. Fly a1 (with p1) from l1_1 to l2_1.
23. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1.
24. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
25. Load p1 into t2 at l2_1.
26. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4 (now p1 is in t2 and p2 is in l2_4, satisfying constraint 6).
27. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_2.
28. Load p2 into t2 at l2_4.
29. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
30. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1 (fulfilling part of the goal: p1 is in l2_1).
31. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4.
32. Load p2 into t2 at l2_4.
33. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_2.
34. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_2 (fulfilling the other part of the goal: p2 is in l2_2).

But wait, we haven't satisfied constraint 5 (p2 must be in l1_3 at some point). Let's revise:

1. Initially, p1 and p2 are both in l2_1, satisfying constraint 1.
2. Load p1 into a2 at l2_1 (satisfies constraint 7).
3. Fly a2 (with p1) from l2_1 to l1_1.
4. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1.
5. Fly a2 from l1_1 back to l2_1.
6. Load p2 into a2 at l2_1.
7. Fly a2 (with p2) from l2_1 to l1_1.
8. Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1.
9. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1.
10. Load p2 into t1 at l1_1.
11. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_3.
12. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_3 (now p2 is in l1_3, satisfying constraint 5).
13. Load p1 into t1 at l1_1.
14. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_3 (now p1 is in t1 at l1_3 and p2 is also in l1_3. However, for constraint 8, p2 needs to be in l2_3. So we need to move p2 back to l2_3).
15. Load p2 into t1 at l1_3.
16. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1.
17. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1.
18. Load p2 into a1 at l1_1 (a1 is at l1_1).
19. Fly a1 (with p2) from l1_1 to l2_1.
20. Unload p2 from a1 at l2_1.
21. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1.
22. Load p2 into t2 at l2_1.
23. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_3.
24. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_3 (now p2 is in l2_3 and p1 is in t1 at l1_3, satisfying constraint 8).
25. Load p2 into t2 at l2_3.
26. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_4.
27. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_4 (now p2 is in l2_4, satisfying constraint 9).
28. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_3 (We just moved it to l1_1 in step 16, but now we need to move it back to pick up p1. This is redundant, but okay for now).
29. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_3 (if it's still loaded, not quite sure, but let's assume so).
30. Load p1 into t1 at l1_3.
31. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1.
32. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1.
33. Load p1 into a1 at l1_1.
34. Fly a1 (with p1) from l1_1 to l2_1.
35. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1.
36. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
37. Load p1 into t2 at l2_1.
38. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4 (now p1 is in t2 at l2_4 and p2 is in l2_4, satisfying constraint 6).
39. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
40. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1 (fulfilling part of the goal: p1 is in l2_1).
41. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4.
42. Load p2 into t2 at l2_4.
43. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_2.
44. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_2 (fulfilling the other part of the goal: p2 is in l2_2).

But wait, we're missing constraint 2. We need to ensure p1 is in l2_4 at some point.

Ok, after step 38, p1 is in t2 at l2_4. We can unload p1 at this point, ensuring it's in l2_4. Then we can load it back onto t2 to continue with the rest of the plan.

Let's adjust:

38. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4.
39. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_4 (now p1 is in l2_4, satisfying constraint 2).
40. Load p1 into t2 at l2_4 (now p1 is in t2 at l2_4 and p2 is in l2_4, satisfying constraint 6).
41. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
42. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1 (fulfilling part of the goal: p1 is in l2_1).
43. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4.
44. Load p2 into t2 at l2_4.
45. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_2.
46. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_2 (fulfilling the other part of the goal: p2 is in l2_2).

But wait, I think we've overcomplicated this. Let's reconsider the initial state and goal, and see if there's a more straightforward way to satisfy all constraints.

Initial state:
- p1 and p2 are both in l2_1 (airport in city c2)
- t1 is in l1_3 (city c1), t2 is in l2_3 (city c2)
- a1 is in l1_1 (airport in city c1), a2 is in l2_1 (airport in city c2)

Goal:
- p1 should remain in l2_1
- p2 should be in l2_2

Let's try to satisfy the constraints more efficiently:

1. Initially, p1 and p2 are both in l2_1, satisfying constraint 1 (p2 must be in l2_1 at some point).
2. Load p2 into t2 at l2_1
3. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_3
4. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_3 (p2 is now in l2_3)
5. Load p1 into a2 at l2_1 (satisfies constraint 7: p1 or p2 in a2 at some point)
6. Fly a2 (with p1) from l2_1 to l1_1
7. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1
8. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1
9. Load p1 into t1 at l1_1
10. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_3 (now p1 is in t1 at l1_3 and p2 is in l2_3, satisfying constraint 8: p2 in l2_3 and p1 in t1 at some point)
11. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_3
12. Load p2 into t2 at l2_3
13. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_4
14. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_4 (now p2 is in l2_4, satisfying constraint 9: p2 in l2_4 at some point)
15. Fly a2 from l1_1 back to l2_1
16. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1
17. Load p1 into t1 at l1_3
18. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1
19. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1
20. Load p1 into a2 at l1_1
21. Fly a2 (with p1) from l1_1 to l2_1
22. Unload p1 from a2 at l2_1
23. Load p2 into a1 at l2_4 (not possible, can't load at l2_4 as it's not an airport)

Actually, let's get back to constraint 5 (p2 must be in l1_3). To do this, we need to fly p2 from city c2 to city c1, and then drive it to l1_3.

1. Initially, p1 and p2 are both in l2_1, satisfying constraint 1 (p2 must be in l2_1 at some point).
2. Load p2 into a2 at l2_1.

41. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.

47. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_2.

Hmm, I'm still not satisfied with this plan. It's quite long and I think I can simplify it further. Let me be more explicit about tracking the constraints to make sure we don't lose track. Specifically, the constraint on when p2 is in l2_2, it needs to have been in l2_3 earlier or p1 should have been in l2_2 earlier.

1. Initially, p1 and p2 are both in l2_1, satisfying constraint 1 (p2 must be in l2_1 at some point).

21. Fly a2 (with p1) from l2_1 to l1_1.
22. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1.
23. Load p1 into t1 at l1_1.
24. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_3 (now p1 is in t1 at l1_3, with p2 in l2_3, this satisfies constraint 8: p2 in l2_3 and p1 in t1 at some point).
25. Load p2 into t2 at l2_3.
26. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_4.
27. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_4 (now p2 is in l2_4, satisfying constraint 9: p2 in l2_4 at some point).

32. Load p1 into a1 at l1_1.
33. Fly a1 (with p1) from l1_1 to l2_1.
34. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1 (this, combined with the fact that p2 is in l2_4, satisfies constraint 2: p1 in l2_4 after or while p2 in l2_1, as p2 was in l2_1 at the start and p1 will go to l2_4 soon).
35. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
36. Load p1 into t2 at l2_1.
37. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4 (now p1 is in t2 at l2_4 and p2 is in l2_4, satisfying constraint 6).
38. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_4 (now p1 is in l2_4, satisfying constraint 2).
39. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
40. Load p1 into t2 at l2_4.
41. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.

45. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_2.
46. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_2 (p2 is now in l2_2, as per goal).

Hmm, I still think we can optimize this. I'm having a hard time getting a clean plan through. Let's focus on satisfying the constraints first, then achieve the goal:

1. Initially, p1 and p2 are both in l2_1, satisfying constraint 1.
2. Load p2 into a2 at l2_1 (satisfies constraint 7).

28. Load p2 into t2 at l2_3.
29. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_4.
30. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_4 (satisfies constraint 9).
31. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1.
32. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1.
33. Load p1 into a1 at l1_1.
34. Fly a1 (with p1) from l1_1 to l2_1.

36. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
37. Load p1 into t2 at l2_1.

40. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
41. Load p1 into t2 at l2_4.
42. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
43. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1 (p1 is now in l2_1, as per goal).
44. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4.
45. Load p2 into t2 at l2_4.
46. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_2.
47. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_2 (p2 is now in l2_2, as per goal).

Hmm, this plan seems even longer than before. I'm worried I'm making a mistake in my planning. Let me try a cleaner, step-by-step approach, focusing on the goals and constraints:

***
Looking at the current state:
Packages p1 and p2 are in l2_1 (airport). The goal is to have p1 in l2_1 and p2 in l2_2.

So we need to move p2 to l2_2, while ensuring all constraints are met. The constraints are:

1. p2 must be in l2_1 at some point (already satisfied by the initial state).
2. If p2 is in l2_1, then p1 must be in l2_4 at the same time or later (p2 is in l2_1 right now, so we need to make sure p1 gets to l2_4 later).
3. p2 must be in l2_2 at some point (part of the goal).
4. If p2 is in l2_2, then p2 should have been in l2_3 earlier, or p1 should have been in l2_2 earlier (since we want p2 to be in l2_2, we need to make sure either p2 goes via l2_3 or p1 goes to l2_2 first).
5. p2 must be in l1_3 at some point.
6. At some point, p1 must be in t2 and p2 in l2_4.
7. At some point, p1 or p2 must be in a2.
8. At some point, p2 must be in l2_3 and p1 in t1 at the same time.
9. p2 must be in l2_4 at some point.

In our plan, we need to ensure p2 is in l2_3 and then p1 gets loaded onto t1 (constraint 8). This means p1 has to be taken to city c1 and loaded onto t1. Also, p2 needs to be moved to l1_3 at some point (constraint 5), which also requires flying p2 to city c1. We also need to make sure p1 is in truck t2 while p2 is in l2_4 (constraint 6).

Ok, final, clean plan:

1. Load p2 into a2 at l2_1 (satisfies constraint 7).
2. Fly a2 (with p2) from l2_1 to l1_1.
3. Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1.
4. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1.
5. Load p2 into t1 at l1_1.
6. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_3.
7. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_3 (satisfies constraint 5).
8. Fly a2 from l1_1 to l2_1.
9. Load p1 into a2 at l2_1.
10. Fly a2 (with p1) from l2_1 to l1_1.
11. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1.
12. Load p1 into t1 at l1_1.

29. Load p2 into t2 at l2_3.
30. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_4.
31. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_4 (satisfies constraint 9).

34. Load p1 into a1 at l1_1.
35. Fly a1 (with p1) from l1_1 to l2_1.
36. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1.
37. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
38. Load p1 into t2 at l2_1.
39. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4 (now p1 is in t2 at l2_4 and p2 is in l2_4, satisfying constraint 6).

46. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_2.
47. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_2 (p2 is now in l2_2, as per goal).
