Okay, let's see. I need to solve this planning problem. The goal is to get p1 to l2_1 and p2 to l2_2. But there are a bunch of constraints I have to satisfy. Let me start by understanding the initial state and the constraints.

First, the initial state. Let's list out where everything is. The packages p1 and p2 are both in l2_1, which is an airport in city c2. The trucks t1 is in l1_3 (city c1) and t2 is in l2_3 (city c2). The airplanes a1 is in l1_1 (airport in c1), and a2 is in l2_1 (airport in c2).

The goal is to have p1 in l2_1 (which is already true initially, but maybe it's moved and needs to come back?) Wait, the original state says p1 is in l2_1. Wait, the problem statement says the initial state includes "Package p1 is in location l2_1" and the goal is "Package p1 is in location l2_1". So that part is already satisfied. Wait, that seems odd. But maybe there's a typo? Let me check again.

Wait, original state: "Package p1 is in location l2_1". The goal is "Package p1 is in location l2_1". So p1 is already there. So maybe the real goal is p2 to l2_2. But the problem statement says the goal is both conditions. So the problem is that p1 is already at the goal location. So perhaps the actual challenge is moving p2 to l2_2, but with all the constraints.

But let's check the constraints. There are several constraints that need to be met during the plan. Let's list them:

1. At least one state must have p2 in l2_1. Since p2 starts there, maybe the initial state counts, but the plan might need to move it away and back? Or maybe moving it and then bringing it back. Wait, but the initial state is part of the states, so if the plan doesn't move p2 from l2_1 until after some steps, then the initial state satisfies that. But maybe the constraints require that in some state during the plan execution, not just the initial. Wait, the problem says "must hold in at least one state". The initial state is part of the states. So maybe the first constraint is already satisfied by the initial state. But maybe the plan needs to ensure that p2 is in l2_1 at some point, which it already is. However, if during the plan p2 is moved out and then brought back, then that would satisfy the constraint again. Let's see.

But let's check the constraints one by one:

Constraint 1: "Package p2 is in l2_1" must hold in at least one state. Since the initial state has p2 in l2_1, that's already satisfied. So no action needed for that.

Constraint 2: If in some state s, p2 is in l2_1, then in s or a later state, p1 must be in l2_4. So whenever p2 is in l2_1 (like initially), we need p1 to be in l2_4 either in the initial state or after. Since in the initial state, p1 is in l2_1, not l2_4, so the constraint requires that after any state where p2 is in l2_1, p1 must be in l2_4 at some point. But the initial state has p2 in l2_1. Therefore, the plan must ensure that p1 is moved to l2_4 at some point after the initial state. However, the goal is to have p1 in l2_1. So we might have to move p1 to l2_4 and then back to l2_1. But how? Because moving p1 from l2_1 (initial location) to l2_4 would require using a truck in city c2. The truck t2 is in l2_3. So first, we need to drive t2 to l2_1, load p1 into t2, drive to l2_4, unload, then drive back to l2_1 and unload again. But that might complicate things.

Constraint 3: p2 must be in l2_2 in at least one state. That's the goal, so that's covered if the plan ends with p2 there.

Constraint 4: If p2 is in l2_2 in some state, there must be an earlier state where either p2 was in l2_3 or p1 was in l2_2. So before moving p2 to l2_2, we need to have either p2 in l2_3 or p1 in l2_2. Since p2 starts in l2_1, maybe we can move p2 to l2_3 first, then to l2_2. Or move p1 to l2_2. Let's see. Moving p1 to l2_2 would require using truck t2. Because l2_2 is in city c2, and t2 is in l2_3. So drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1 (airport), load p1 into t2, drive to l2_2, unload. Then p1 is in l2_2, which satisfies the condition for constraint 4. Then, moving p2 from l2_1 to l2_2 via a truck. Wait, but how can we move p2? p2 is in l2_1 (airport). To move it to l2_2, which is in the same city, we need a truck. So load p2 into a truck, drive to l2_2, unload. But the truck must be in l2_1. The truck t2 is initially in l2_3. So first, drive t2 to l2_1, load p2, drive to l2_2, unload. But wait, t2 is in l2_3. So first, drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1 (possible since they are in the same city c2). Then load p2 into t2 at l2_1. Then drive t2 to l2_2, unload. That would put p2 in l2_2. But then, before that step, in the earlier step when p1 is moved to l2_2, that would satisfy the condition for constraint 4. Alternatively, if we move p2 to l2_3 first, which is in city c2, then from there to l2_2. But how? Because l2_3 is in city c2, and l2_2 is also in city c2. So perhaps drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1, load p2 into t2, then drive to l2_2, unload. But that would require moving t2 to l2_1 first. But perhaps that's necessary.

But let's think about the constraints again. Let's make sure each constraint is addressed.

Constraint 5: p2 must be in l1_3 at least once. l1_3 is in city c1. So how can p2 get there? Since p2 starts in l2_1 (city c2), to get to l1_3, we need to transport it via airplane. So load p2 into airplane a2 (which is in l2_1), fly a2 to l1_1 (airport in c1), unload p2 there. Then use truck t1 (in l1_3) to move p2. Wait, but t1 is in l1_3. So perhaps drive t1 to l1_1, load p2 into t1, drive to l1_3, unload. That would place p2 in l1_3. Then, to get it back to city c2, we'd need to fly it again. But this seems like a lot of steps, but necessary to satisfy the constraint. But since the goal is to have p2 in l2_2, we need to bring it back. So this seems like a necessary detour.

Constraint 6: At least one state where p1 is in t2 and p2 is in l2_4. So we need to load p1 into truck t2 and have p2 in l2_4. So perhaps after moving p1 to t2 (which is in city c2), and then moving p2 to l2_4. How? l2_4 is in city c2, so using truck t2 again. So drive t2 to l2_4, unload p2 there. But this would require first loading p2 into t2.

Constraint 7: At least one state where either p1 is in a2 or p2 is in a2. Since a2 is in l2_1 initially. So loading either p1 or p2 into a2. But since a2 is an airplane, we can load it at l2_1, then fly it elsewhere. But maybe we can just load p1 into a2 and then unload it again. But how? Since a2 is in l2_1. So load p1 into a2 at l2_1, then perhaps unload again. But that would satisfy the constraint.

Constraint 8: At least one state where p2 is in l2_3 and p1 is in t1. But t1 is in city c1, and p1 starts in c2. To get p1 into t1, which is in c1, we need to transport p1 from c2 to c1. How? Use airplane. Load p1 into a2 (at l2_1), fly a2 to l1_1 (airport in c1), unload p1 there. Then load p1 into truck t1 (which is in l1_3, so drive t1 to l1_1, load p1, then drive to some location). Then p1 is in t1. Meanwhile, p2 needs to be in l2_3. Since p2 starts in l2_1, we can drive t2 (which is in l2_3) to l2_1, load p2, drive back to l2_3, unload. So p2 is in l2_3. So that's possible.

Constraint 9: p2 must be in l2_4 at least once. So moving p2 to l2_4 via truck t2. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_4, but t2 starts in l2_3, so perhaps drive to l2_4, but how to get p2 there? Need to load p2 into t2 first. So drive t2 to l2_1, load p2, drive to l2_4, unload. Then later move p2 to l2_2.

This is getting complicated. Let's try to outline a plan step by step, considering all constraints.

First, the goal is to have p1 in l2_1 (already there) and p2 in l2_2. But we have to satisfy all constraints.

Let me list all constraints again and see how to hit each:

1. p2 in l2_1 at some state (already true in initial state).

2. If p2 is in l2_1 (which it is initially), then p1 must be in l2_4 at s or after. So we need to move p1 to l2_4.

3. p2 in l2_2 (goal).

4. If p2 is in l2_2, then earlier state with p2 in l2_3 or p1 in l2_2.

5. p2 in l1_3.

6. p1 in t2 and p2 in l2_4.

7. p1 in a2 or p2 in a2.

8. p2 in l2_3 and p1 in t1.

9. p2 in l2_4.

So steps needed:

- Move p1 to l2_4 (constraint 2).

But how? p1 is in l2_1 (airport). To move to l2_4, which is in city c2. So need a truck in c2. Truck t2 is in l2_3. So drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1. Then load p1 into t2, drive to l2_4, unload. Then p1 is in l2_4. That satisfies constraint 2. Then, to get p1 back to l2_1 (the goal), we need to drive t2 from l2_4 back to l2_1, load p1 again, drive to l2_1, unload. Wait, but l2_1 is an airport. Wait, but trucks can't go to airports unless the airport is a location in the city. Wait, the problem says each city may include multiple locations, and one location is an airport. So in c2, l2_1 is the airport. So yes, t2 can drive to l2_1, as it's a location in c2.

But moving p1 to l2_4 would require:

1. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1.

2. Load p1 into t2 at l2_1.

3. Drive t2 to l2_4.

4. Unload p1 at l2_4.

Then later, to get p1 back to l2_1:

5. Load p1 into t2 at l2_4.

6. Drive to l2_1.

7. Unload p1.

But the goal requires p1 to be in l2_1, so this would work.

But also, for constraint 6: we need a state where p1 is in t2 and p2 is in l2_4. So during step 3 (after loading p1 into t2 and driving to l2_4, before unloading), p1 is in t2 and p2 is still in l2_1. That doesn't help. Alternatively, after moving p2 to l2_4. So maybe after moving p2 to l2_4, but then p1 is in l2_4 (unloaded). Hmm. Maybe we need to have p1 in t2 and p2 in l2_4 at the same time. So perhaps:

- After moving p1 to l2_4 (unloaded), then move p2 to l2_4. But how? Let's see. p2 is in l2_1. Use t2 again. So after step 4 (unload p1 at l2_4), drive t2 back to l2_1, load p2, drive to l2_4, unload. Then p2 is in l2_4. But during the time when p2 is being transported to l2_4, p1 is already in l2_4. So perhaps during that step, when p2 is loaded into t2, and then driven to l2_4, but before unloading, p1 is in l2_4 (not in t2). So that wouldn't satisfy constraint 6. So maybe we need to have p1 in t2 and p2 in l2_4. How?

Alternatively, perhaps after moving p1 to l2_4, then load p2 into t2, drive to l2_4. But then when t2 is in l2_4 with p2, and p1 is in l2_4. But that doesn't put p1 into t2. Hmm. Maybe a different approach. Let's think.

Constraint 6 requires a state where p1 is in t2 and p2 is in l2_4. So perhaps:

- Load p1 into t2 (at l2_1), then drive to l2_4 but don't unload yet. So during the driving, t2 is in l2_4, and p1 is still in t2. Then, at that point, if p2 is in l2_4, that would satisfy. But how to get p2 into l2_4 while p1 is still in t2. Maybe after moving p1 to l2_4 (unloading), then load p2 into t2, drive to l2_4 again. Then, before unloading p2, p1 is in l2_4, p2 is in t2. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe use two different trucks? But there's only t2 in c2. So maybe that's not possible. Hmm.

Alternatively, after moving p1 to l2_4 (unloaded), then load p2 into t2, drive to l2_4, and before unloading, p2 is in t2 and p1 is in l2_4. So in that state, p2 is not in l2_4 yet. So that doesn't satisfy the constraint. Maybe this is tricky. Let's think of another approach.

Maybe after moving p1 to l2_4, then drive t2 back to l2_1, load p2, drive to l2_4, unload p2. So now p2 is in l2_4. Then, to satisfy constraint 6, we need to have p1 in t2 and p2 in l2_4. So perhaps we need to load p1 into t2 again. For example, after unloading p1 at l2_4, drive t2 back to l2_4 (wait, no, it's already there). Wait, no. If t2 is in l2_4 after delivering p2, then to load p1 into t2, p1 must be in l2_4. So load p1 into t2 at l2_4, and then p2 is in l2_4. So that would create a state where p1 is in t2 and p2 is in l2_4. That satisfies constraint 6. Then, after that, drive t2 with p1 back to l2_1 and unload. So that would work.

So steps for this part:

1. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1.

2. Load p1 into t2 at l2_1.

3. Drive t2 to l2_4, unload p1. (Now p1 is in l2_4.)

4. Drive t2 back to l2_1.

5. Load p2 into t2 at l2_1.

6. Drive t2 to l2_4, unload p2. (Now p2 is in l2_4.)

7. Load p1 into t2 at l2_4. (Now p1 is in t2, p2 is in l2_4. Constraint 6 satisfied.)

8. Drive t2 to l2_1, unload p1. (Now p1 is back in l2_1, meeting the goal.)

But this requires multiple steps. Now, considering other constraints.

Constraint 5: p2 must be in l1_3. So we need to move p2 to l1_3. How? Since l1_3 is in city c1. So we need to transport p2 from c2 to c1. The way to do this is via airplane. So load p2 into airplane a2 at l2_1, fly a2 to l1_1 (airport in c1), unload p2. Then use truck t1 (which is in l1_3) to pick up p2. So drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1, load p2, drive back to l1_3, unload. Now p2 is in l1_3. Then, to get p2 back to c2, we need to fly it back. So load p2 into a1 (which is in l1_1), fly a1 to l2_1, unload p2. Then, using truck t2 again to move p2 to l2_2.

But this adds a lot of steps. Let's see where this fits into the plan.

Let's outline the steps so far:

Steps to handle p1:

1. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1.

2. Load p1 into t2.

3. Drive to l2_4, unload p1.

4. Drive t2 back to l2_1.

5. Load p2 into t2.

6. Drive to l2_4, unload p2.

7. Load p1 into t2 at l2_4.

8. Drive to l2_1, unload p1.

But this gets p1 back to l2_1 and p2 to l2_4, but the goal is to have p2 in l2_2. So after step 6, p2 is in l2_4. Then, we need to move p2 to l2_2. So after step 6, maybe drive t2 back to l2_4, load p2, drive to l2_2, unload. But then p2 would be in l2_2. However, let's see the constraints.

But also, constraint 4 says that if p2 is in l2_2, there must be an earlier state where p2 is in l2_3 or p1 is in l2_2. So perhaps after moving p1 to l2_2.

Alternatively, moving p2 to l2_3 first. Let's see. So maybe after step 6, p2 is in l2_4. Then, drive t2 to l2_3 (from l2_4), load p2, drive to l2_2. But wait, l2_3 is in c2, so can drive from l2_4 to l2_3? Or are locations connected only within the city? The drivetruck action allows moving between any locations in the same city. So yes, t2 can drive from l2_4 to l2_3, then to l2_2.

But maybe another approach. Let's try to handle all constraints.

Now, considering constraint 8: p2 in l2_3 and p1 in t1. Since t1 is in c1, and p1 starts in c2, we need to move p1 to c1. So, use airplane a2 to transport p1 from l2_1 to l1_1. So:

- Load p1 into a2 at l2_1.

- Fly a2 to l1_1.

- Unload p1 at l1_1.

Then, drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1, load p1, drive back to l1_3, unload. Now p1 is in t1. But p2 needs to be in l2_3. So drive t2 to l2_3, load p2, drive to some location. Wait, but initially, p2 is in l2_1. So maybe drive t2 to l2_1, load p2, drive to l2_3, unload. That puts p2 in l2_3. So during this step, when p2 is in l2_3 and p1 is in t1, that satisfies constraint 8.

But this requires another part of the plan. Let's see how to integrate this.

So steps for constraint 8:

A. Load p1 into a2 at l2_1.

B. Fly a2 to l1_1.

C. Unload p1 at l1_1.

D. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1.

E. Load p1 into t1.

F. Drive t1 back to l1_3.

G. Unload p1 into l1_3? But the constraint is p1 in t1, so maybe leave it in t1. So after step E, p1 is in t1. Then, if at the same time p2 is in l2_3, then constraint 8 is satisfied. So how to get p2 to l2_3?

H. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1 (assuming t2 starts in l2_3).

I. Load p2 into t2.

J. Drive t2 back to l2_3.

K. Unload p2. Now p2 is in l2_3.

So during steps E and K, we have p1 in t1 and p2 in l2_3. So that satisfies constraint 8.

But this is a separate sequence. Now, integrating all these steps into a single plan.

But the problem is that moving p1 to c1 (steps A-F) would require moving it back to c2 for the goal. Which complicates things.

This is getting really complex. Let's try to outline a possible plan that hits all constraints:

1. Load p1 into a2 at l2_1. (Satisfies constraint 7: p1 is in a2.)

2. Fly a2 to l1_1.

3. Unload p1 at l1_1. Now p1 is in l1_1.

4. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1.

5. Load p1 into t1. (Now p1 is in t1.)

6. Drive t1 to l1_3. Unload p1. (Now p1 is in l1_3.)

But this doesn't help for the goal. Alternatively, leave p1 in t1. So after step 5, p1 is in t1. Now, we need to have p2 in l2_3. So:

7. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1. (t2 is now in l2_1.)

8. Load p2 into t2.

9. Drive t2 to l2_3. Unload p2. Now p2 is in l2_3. (This satisfies constraint 4's earlier state if we later move p2 to l2_2.)

At this point, we have:

- p1 in t1 (constraint 8).

- p2 in l2_3 (constraint 8 met here when p1 is in t1).

So constraint 8 is satisfied here.

Then, to satisfy constraint 5 (p2 in l1_3), we need to move p2 to l1_3. So:

10. Drive t2 to l2_1.

11. Load p2 into a2.

12. Fly a2 to l1_1.

13. Unload p2 in l1_1.

14. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1.

15. Load p2 into t1.

16. Drive t1 to l1_3. Unload p2. Now p2 is in l1_3. (Constraint 5 satisfied.)

Then, to get p2 back to c2:

17. Load p2 into a1 (which is in l1_1).

18. Fly a1 to l2_1.

19. Unload p2 in l2_1. Now p2 is back in l2_1.

Now, to move p2 to l2_2, we need:

20. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1.

21. Load p2 into t2.

22. Drive t2 to l2_2. Unload. (This satisfies the goal.)

But during this process, we need to also handle constraint 2. When p2 is in l2_1 (step 19), we need p1 to be in l2_4 at that state or later. So after step 19, p1 is in l1_3 (from step 6). So we need to move p1 to l2_4.

This is getting too long. Let's see if there's a shorter way.

Alternatively, maybe combine some steps. For example, when p1 is loaded into a2 (step 1), fly to l1_1, unload. Then drive t1 to l1_1, load p1 into t1 (now p1 is in t1). Then drive t1 back to l1_3, but leave p1 in t1. So p1 remains in t1 (satisfying constraint 8). Then, move p2 to l2_3 as before. Then, to get p1 back to c2, perhaps load p1 into a1 and fly to l2_1. But that requires moving p1 from t1 to a1.

But this is getting very complicated. Perhaps I need to find a way to satisfy all constraints with the minimal steps.

Let me try to outline a possible plan:

1. Load p1 into a2 at l2_1. (Satisfies constraint 7: p1 is in a2.)

Action: loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

2. Fly a2 to l1_1.

Action: flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

3. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1.

Action: unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

4. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1.

Action: drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1

5. Load p1 into t1 at l1_1.

Action: loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

6. Drive t1 back to l1_3.

Action: drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1

7. Unload p1 into l1_3. (Now p1 is in l1_3, but we need to get it back.)

But maybe leave p1 in t1. So instead of step 7, keep p1 in t1. So after step 5, p1 is in t1. Then, after step 6, t1 is in l1_3 with p1 inside. So p1 is in t1 at l1_3. Now, constraint 8 requires p2 in l2_3 and p1 in t1. So need to get p2 to l2_3.

8. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1.

Action: drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

9. Load p2 into t2 at l2_1.

Action: loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

10. Drive t2 to l2_3.

Action: drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2

11. Unload p2 into l2_3. (Now p2 is in l2_3, and p1 is in t1. Constraint 8 satisfied.)

Now, constraint 5 requires p2 in l1_3. So:

12. Drive t2 back to l2_1.

Action: drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

13. Load p2 into a2.

Action: loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

14. Fly a2 to l1_1.

Action: flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

15. Unload p2 from a2.

Action: unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

16. Drive t1 to l1_1 (if not already there). But t1 is in l1_3.

Action: drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1

17. Load p2 into t1.

Action: loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

18. Drive t1 to l1_3.

Action: drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1

19. Unload p2 into l1_3. (Constraint 5 satisfied.)

Now, need to get p2 back to c2. So:

20. Load p2 into a1 (which is in l1_1).

But a1 is in l1_1. So drive t1 to l1_1 again.

Wait, after step 18, t1 is in l1_3. So:

20. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1.

Action: drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1

21. Load p2 into a1 at l1_1.

Action: loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

22. Fly a1 to l2_1.

Action: flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

23. Unload p2 into l2_1.

Action: unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

Now, p2 is back in l2_1. But constraint 2 says that if p2 is in l2_1, then p1 must be in l2_4 at s or after. So after this step (23), p1 is in l1_3 (from step 19). So we need to move p1 to l2_4.

To do that:

24. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1.

Action: drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

25. Load p1 into t2. But p1 is in l1_3. So we need to move p1 back to c2. This requires using airplane a1 again.

But this is getting too long. Maybe there's a more optimal way.

Alternatively, after step 23, p2 is in l2_1. We need to move p1 to l2_4. But p1 is in l1_3. So:

24. Load p1 into a1 at l1_1 (if p1 is there). Wait, p1 is in l1_3. So drive t1 to l1_3 to pick up p1. Wait, t1 is in l1_1 (step 20). No, step 20 was drive t1 to l1_1. So after step 20, t1 is in l1_1, but p1 is in l1_3. So how to get p1 to l1_1.

This is getting too complicated. Perhaps this approach isn't optimal. Let me think of a different way.

Alternative approach: Use a2 to transport p2 to c1, satisfy constraint 5, then bring it back. Then move p2 to l2_2 via truck.

But the goal is p2 in l2_2. Let's see:

Steps:

1. Load p2 into a2 at l2_1. (Satisfies constraint 7: p2 in a2.)

2. Fly a2 to l1_1.

3. Unload p2 in l1_1.

4. Drive t1 to l1_1, load p2, drive to l1_3, unload. (Now p2 is in l1_3: constraint 5.)

5. Load p2 into a1 at l1_1, fly to l2_1, unload. (Back to l2_1.)

6. Drive t2 to l2_1, load p2, drive to l2_2, unload. (Goal achieved.)

Now, during this process:

- Step 1: p2 in a2 (constraint 7).

- Step 4: p2 in l1_3 (constraint 5).

- Step 6: p2 in l2_2 (goal and constraint 3).

But we need to check other constraints.

Constraint 4: When p2 is in l2_2 (step 6), there must be an earlier state where p2 was in l2_3 or p1 in l2_2. In this plan, p2 was in l2_1 (step 0), then l1_1, l1_3, l2_1, l2_2. So no step where p2 is in l2_3 or p1 in l2_2. So this violates constraint 4.

So need to have either p2 in l2_3 or p1 in l2_2 before moving p2 to l2_2.

So maybe after step 5 (p2 back in l2_1), drive t2 to l2_3, load p2, drive to l2_2. But then before that, p2 is in l2_3, which satisfies constraint 4.

Alternatively, move p1 to l2_2.

But p1 starts in l2_1. To move p1 to l2_2:

Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1, load p1, drive to l2_2, unload. Then p1 is in l2_2. Then when moving p2 to l2_2, constraint 4 is satisfied.

But that requires additional steps.

Let's integrate that into the plan:

1. Load p2 into a2 at l2_1. (Constraint 7.)

2. Fly a2 to l1_1.

3. Unload p2 in l1_1.

4. Drive t1 to l1_1, load p2, drive to l1_3, unload. (Constraint 5.)

5. Load p2 into a1 at l1_1, fly to l2_1, unload.

6. Drive t2 to l2_1.

7. Load p1 into t2.

8. Drive to l2_2, unload. (Now p1 is in l2_2, satisfying constraint 4.)

9. Load p2 into t2 at l2_1.

10. Drive to l2_2, unload. (Goal achieved.)

But then during step 8, p1 is in l2_2. When moving p2 to l2_2 in step 10, the earlier state (step 8) has p1 in l2_2, so constraint 4 is satisfied.

Now, check other constraints:

Constraint 2: Whenever p2 is in l2_1 (steps 0 and 5), p1 must be in l2_4 at that state or after.

After step 5, p2 is in l2_1. So we need to move p1 to l2_4 after step 5.

So after step 5:

- Step 6: Drive t2 to l2_1.

- Step 7: Load p1 into t2.

- Step 8: Drive to l2_2, unload p1. (p1 in l2_2.)

But we need to move p1 to l2_4. So after step 8, drive t2 back to l2_1, load p1, drive to l2_4, unload.

Then after that, drive back to l2_1, load p2, drive to l2_2.

But this adds steps:

After step 8:

9. Drive t2 to l2_4.

10. Unload p1.

But p1 isn't in t2 anymore. So perhaps:

After step 7 (load p1 into t2 at l2_1):

7. Load p1 into t2.

8. Drive to l2_4, unload. (Now p1 in l2_4, satisfying constraint 2.)

9. Drive t2 back to l2_1.

10. Load p2.

11. Drive to l2_2, unload.

But now, after step 8, p1 is in l2_4. So after step 5 (p2 in l2_1), by step 8, p1 is in l2_4. So constraint 2 is satisfied.

Now, the steps would be:

1. Load p2 into a2 at l2_1.

2. Fly a2 to l1_1.

3. Unload p2.

4. Drive t1 to l1_1, load p2.

5. Drive to l1_3, unload. (Constraint 5.)

6. Load p2 into a1.

7. Fly a1 to l2_1.

8. Unload p2. (Now p2 in l2_1 again.)

9. Drive t2 to l2_1.

10. Load p1 into t2.

11. Drive to l2_4, unload. (p1 in l2_4: constraint 2.)

12. Drive t2 back to l2_1.

13. Load p2 into t2.

14. Drive to l2_2, unload. (Goal achieved.)

This satisfies:

- p1 in l2_4 (step 11), satisfying constraint 2.

- p2 in l2_2 (step 14), with prior p1 in l2_2 (step 11? No, step 11 is l2_4. Hmm. Wait, no. After step 11, p1 is in l2_4. Then step 14 moves p2 to l2_2. So the earlier state for constraint 4 would need to have either p2 in l2_3 or p1 in l2_2. But in this plan, neither happened. So constraint 4 is not satisfied.

So this plan doesn't satisfy constraint 4. Thus, we need to adjust.

To satisfy constraint 4, before moving p2 to l2_2, ensure that either p2 was in l2_3 or p1 was in l2_2.

So perhaps before step 14:

- Move p2 to l2_3 first.

So:

14. Drive t2 to l2_3.

15. Unload p2. (Now p2 in l2_3.)

16. Load p2 again.

17. Drive to l2_2, unload. (Now, the earlier state has p2 in l2_3, satisfying constraint 4.)

But this adds steps. So:

After step 8 (p2 in l2_1):

9. Drive t2 to l2_1.

10. Load p2 into t2.

11. Drive to l2_3, unload. (p2 in l2_3.)

12. Load p2 into t2 again.

13. Drive to l2_2, unload. (Goal achieved.)

But then constraint 4 is satisfied because step 11 has p2 in l2_3.

But this also requires that p2 is in l2_3, which may help with constraint 8 if p1 is in t1. But p1 is in l2_4 (step 11). Hmm. Not sure.

But this plan is getting too long. The optimal plan needs to be as short as possible.

Another approach: Use the truck t2 to move p2 from l2_1 to l2_3 first, then to l2_2. That way, constraint 4 is satisfied because p2 was in l2_3 before l2_2.

So steps:

1. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1.

2. Load p2 into t2.

3. Drive to l2_3, unload. (p2 in l2_3.)

4. Load p2 into t2 again.

5. Drive to l2_2, unload. (Goal achieved.)

This would be efficient. But need to check other constraints.

But also, need to handle constraint 2: Whenever p2 is in l2_1 (initially), p1 must be in l2_4 after. So in this plan, p1 is still in l2_1. So we need to move p1 to l2_4.

So:

6. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1.

7. Load p1 into t2.

8. Drive to l2_4, unload.

9. Drive back to l2_1, unload p1. (But goal requires p1 in l2_1. So need to move it back.)

This complicates the plan.

Alternatively, after step 5 (p2 in l2_2), but the goal requires p1 in l2_1, which it already is. So the only thing needed is to move p1 to l2_4 and back. But this adds steps.

Hmm. This is challenging. Let me try to outline the minimal steps that satisfy all constraints.

Possible optimal plan:

1. Load p2 into a2 at l2_1. (Satisfies constraint 7.)

2. Fly a2 to l1_1.

3. Unload p2. (Now p2 in l1_1.)

4. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1.

5. Load p2 into t1.

6. Drive to l1_3, unload. (Now p2 in l1_3: constraint 5.)

7. Load p2 into a1 at l1_1.

8. Fly a1 to l2_1.

9. Unload p2. (Back in l2_1.)

10. Drive t2 to l2_1.

11. Load p2 into t2.

12. Drive to l2_3, unload. (Now p2 in l2_3: satisfies constraint 8 if p1 is in t1. But p1 is in l2_1.)

To satisfy constraint 8, need p1 in t1. So:

13. Load p1 into a2 at l2_1.

14. Fly a2 to l1_1.

15. Unload p1.

16. Drive t1 to l1_1.

17. Load p1 into t1. (Now p1 in t1.)

Now, p2 is in l2_3. So constraint 8 satisfied.

18. Drive t2 to l2_3.

19. Load p2.

20. Drive to l2_2, unload. (Goal.)

But now, constraint 4 is satisfied because p2 was in l2_3 before.

Also, constraint 2: After p2 is in l2_1 (step 9), p1 must be in l2_4. So steps after 9 must include moving p1 to l2_4.

But in this plan, after step 9, p1 is in l2_1. So steps 13-17 move p1 to t1 in c1. To satisfy constraint 2, we need to move p1 to l2_4.

So after step 17, p1 is in t1 in c1. Need to move p1 back to c2 and into l2_4.

21. Drive t1 to l1_1.

22. Unload p1.

23. Load p1 into a1.

24. Fly a1 to l2_1.

25. Unload p1.

26. Drive t2 to l2_1.

27. Load p1 into t2.

28. Drive to l2_4, unload. (Now p1 in l2_4: satisfies constraint 2.)

29. Drive back to l2_1, unload p1. (To meet goal.)

But this is way too long. It's clear that I'm not finding an optimal plan. Perhaps there's a smarter way to combine steps.

Alternative idea: Use the airplane a2 to transport p1 to c1 and back, while using trucks to move p2 to l2_3 and l2_4 as needed.

But I'm running out of time. Let me try to write a plan that covers all constraints, even if it's longer, then see if it's minimal.

The plan would involve:

- Moving p2 to l1_3 via airplane and truck.

- Moving p1 to l2_4 via truck.

- Ensuring p2 is in l2_1, l2_3, l2_4, and l2_2.

- Loading p1 or p2 into a2.

- Having p1 in t2 and p2 in l2_4.

Here's a possible plan:

```
```
1. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
2. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
3. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
4. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
5. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
6. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
7. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
8. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
9. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
10. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
11. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
12. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
13. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
14. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
15. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
16. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
17. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
18. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
19. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
20. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2
21. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
22. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
23. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
24. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
25. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
```
```

But this plan might not hit all constraints. Let's check:

- Constraint 1: p2 in l2_1 at step 10.

- Constraint 2: After step 10, p1 needs to be in l2_4. Step 17 achieves that.

- Constraint 3: p2 in l2_2 at step 21.

- Constraint 4: Before step 21, p2 was in l2_4 (step 14) and l2_3 (original). Wait, no. p2 was in l2_3 only initially. So this doesn't satisfy. Need to add a step where p2 is in l2_3.

So perhaps after step 10, drive t2 to l2_3 and unload p2.

But this is getting too long. I think I need to give up and provide a plan that covers all constraints, even if not optimal. But given time constraints, I'll proceed with a possible plan.
