Let me break down this logistical planning problem. I'm asked to create a plan to solve a transportation problem involving packages, trucks, and airplanes across different cities and locations.

First, I notice that there's an error in the initial state:
- It says "Package t1 is in location l1_3", but t1 is a truck, not a package
- It says "Package t2 is in location l2_5", but t2 is a truck, not a package
- It says "Package a1 is in location l1_1", but a1 is an airplane, not a package
- It says "Package a2 is in location l2_1", but a2 is an airplane, not a package

I'll assume the intended state is:
- "Truck t1 is in location l1_3"
- "Truck t2 is in location l2_5"
- "Airplane a1 is in location l1_1" (which is an airport)
- "Airplane a2 is in location l2_1" (which is an airport)

The goal is to bring about the following situation:
- "Package p1 is in location l2_4"
- "Package p2 is in location l2_1"

There are additional constraints that have to be satisfied during the execution of the plan. Let's list them:

1. "Package p2 is in location l2_4" at some point
2. "Package p1 is in a1" at some point (p1 must be in airplane a1)
3. "Package p2 is in location l2_1" at some point (which is part of the goal)
4. If "Package p2 is in location l2_1", then at some earlier point, "Package p1 is in location l1_3" or "Package p1 is in location l2_3"
5. "Package p1 is in location l2_2" at some point
6. If "Package p1 is in location l2_2", then at that point or later, "Package p2 is in location l1_4" or "Package p2 is in location l2_3"
7. "Package p2 is in location l2_2" at some point
8. If "Package p2 is in location l2_2", then at that point or later, "Package p1 is in location l1_2" or "Package p2 is in location l1_3"
9. "Package p1 is in location l2_5" at some point
10. "Package p2 is in t1" (p2 is in truck t1) or "Package p2 is in location l1_5" at some point

Let's start by understanding our initial state:
- p1 is in location l2_2
- p2 is in location l2_2
- t1 is in location l1_3
- t2 is in location l2_5
- a1 is in location l1_1 (airport)
- a2 is in location l2_1 (airport)

And our goal:
- p1 should end up in l2_4
- p2 should end up in l2_1

Now, let's start planning. I'll need to account for all the constraints while creating the optimal plan.

Constraint 7 is already satisfied in the initial state: both p1 and p2 are in l2_2.

Due to constraint 8, after p2 is in l2_2 (which is true initially), either p1 should be in l1_2 or p2 should be in l1_3 at some point.

Due to constraint 5, p1 needs to be in l2_2 at some point. This is already satisfied in the initial state.

Due to constraint 6, after p1 is in l2_2 (which is true initially), either p2 should be in l1_4 or p2 should be in l2_3 at some point.

Summarizing, we have the following things to achieve:
- Move p1 to l2_4 (goal)
- Move p2 to l2_1 (goal)
- Have p2 in l2_4 at some point (constraint 1)
- Have p1 in a1 at some point (constraint 2)
- Have p2 in l2_1 at some point (constraint 3 and already part of the goal)
- Before p2 is in l2_1, have p1 in l1_3 or l2_3 (constraint 4)
- Have p1 in l2_2 at some point (constraint 5, already satisfied initially)
- After p1 is in l2_2, have p2 in l1_4 or l2_3 (constraint 6)
- Have p2 in l2_2 at some point (constraint 7, already satisfied initially)
- After p2 is in l2_2, have p1 in l1_2 or p2 in l1_3 (constraint 8)
- Have p1 in l2_5 at some point (constraint 9)
- Have p2 in t1 or in l1_5 at some point (constraint 10)

Let's start formulating a plan. I'll need to move the packages to satisfy all the constraints and eventually reach the goal.

Since I'll want to satisfy the temporal constraints, I'm noting that:
1. We need to move p1 to l1_2 or p2 to l1_3 because of constraint 8. Since p1 needs to be in a1 (constraint 2), which would be at the airport l1_1, it makes sense to also move p1 to l1_2. So, let's plan to move p1 to l1_2.
2. We also need to move p2 to l1_4 or l2_3 because of constraint 6. Let's plan to move p2 to l2_3.
3. We need to move p1 to l1_3 or l2_3 before p2 is in l2_1 because of constraint 4. Since I'm already planning to move p1 to l1_2, it makes sense to also move it to l1_3 (since it's in the same city). So, let's plan to move p1 to l1_3.
4. We need to have p2 in t1 or in l1_5 because of constraint 10. Since I'm planning to move p1 to city c1, it makes sense to also move p2 there. Let's plan to move p2 to l1_5.
5. We need to have p1 in l2_5 at some point because of constraint 9. This can be on the way to the final destination l2_4.
6. We need to have p2 in l2_4 at some point because of constraint 1. This can be on the way to the final destination l2_1.

Given the above, let's outline the plan:

Initial state:
- p1 is in l2_2
- p2 is in l2_2
- t1 is in l1_3
- t2 is in l2_5
- a1 is in l1_1
- a2 is in l2_1

We need to move packages and vehicles to satisfy all constraints. Here's a high-level plan:

1. Move t2 to l2_2 to pick up p1 and p2
2. Move t2 with p1 and p2 to l2_3 to satisfy part of constraint 6 (p2 in l2_3 after p1 is in l2_2)
3. Move t2 with p1 and p2 to l2_5 (constraint 9 will be satisfied as p1 will be in l2_5)
4. Load p1 on airplane a2 at l2_1
5. Fly a2 with p1 to l1_1
6. Transfer p1 from a2 to a1 at l1_1 (constraint 2 will be satisfied as p1 will be in a1)
7. Fly a1 with p1 to l2_1
8. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1
9. Move t1 to l1_2
10. Load p1 on t1 at l1_2 (constraint 8 will be satisfied as p1 will be in l1_2 after p2 was in l2_2)
11. Move t1 with p1 to l1_3 (constraint 4 will be satisfied as p1 will be in l1_3 before p2 is in l2_1)
12. Move t1 with p1 to l1_5 (p2 will also be in l1_5, satisfying constraint 10)
13. Load p2 on t1 at l1_5
14. Move t1 with p1 and p2 to l1_3
15. Move t1 with p1 and p2 to l1_1
16. Transfer p1 and p2 to airplane a1 at l1_1
17. Fly a1 with p1 and p2 to l2_1
18. Unload p2 from a1 at l2_1 (goal for p2 achieved)
19. Load p1 on t2 at l2_1
20. Move t2 with p1 to l2_4 (goal for p1 achieved)

Wait, this doesn't seem to make sense logistically. Let me reconsider the plan. Let's first move t2 to pick up p1 and p2 and use it to move them within city c2, and then use airplanes to move them between cities as needed.

Actually, let me reconsider the entire strategy. 

Let me note where we start:
- p1 is in l2_2
- p2 is in l2_2
- t1 is in l1_3
- t2 is in l2_5
- a1 is in l1_1
- a2 is in l2_1

We want to end up with:
- p1 is in l2_4
- p2 is in l2_1

Here's a better plan:

1. Move t2 from l2_5 to l2_2
2. Load p1 and p2 onto t2 at l2_2
3. Move t2 with p1 and p2 to l2_3 (constraint 6 satisfied: p2 in l2_3 after p1 was in l2_2)
4. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_3 (constraint 4 satisfied for the future: p1 in l2_3 before p2 will be in l2_1)
5. Move t2 with p2 to l2_4 (constraint 1 satisfied: p2 in l2_4)
6. Move t2 with p2 to l2_5 (constraint 9 for p1 still needs to be satisfied)
7. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_5
8. Move t2 to l2_3
9. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_3
10. Move t2 with p1 to l2_5 (constraint 9 satisfied: p1 in l2_5)
11. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_5
12. Move t2 with p1 and p2 to l2_1
13. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1 (goal for p2 achieved and constraint 3 satisfied: p2 in l2_1)

But wait, there are other constraints I missed:
- We need p1 to be in a1 at some point (constraint 2)
- After p2 is in l2_2, which is true initially, either p1 should be in l1_2 or p2 should be in l1_3 (constraint 8)
- We need p2 to be in t1 or in l1_5 at some point (constraint 10)

So, I can't just keep p1 and p2 in city c2. I need to move one or both to city c1 to satisfy these constraints.

Let's see... we can move p1 to l1_2 to satisfy constraint 8, move it onto a1 to satisfy constraint 2, and move p2 to either t1 or l1_5 to satisfy constraint 10. Then, we can move them back to their respective goal locations.

Here's a more comprehensive plan:

1. Move t2 from l2_5 to l2_2
2. Load p1 and p2 onto t2 at l2_2
3. Move t2 with p1 and p2 to l2_3 (constraint 6 satisfied: p2 in l2_3 after p1 was in l2_2)
4. Move t2 with p1 and p2 to l2_1
5. Unload p1 and p2 from t2 at l2_1
6. Load p1 and p2 onto a2 at l2_1
7. Fly a2 with p1 and p2 to l1_1
8. Unload p1 and p2 from a2 at l1_1
9. Load p1 onto a1 at l1_1 (constraint 2 satisfied: p1 in a1)
10. Move t1 from l1_3 to l1_1
11. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_1 (constraint 10 satisfied: p2 in t1)
12. Move t1 with p2 to l1_2
13. Unload p1 from a1 at l1_1
14. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_2 (constraint 8 satisfied: p1 in l1_2 after p2 was in l2_2)
15. Move t1 with p1 and p2 to l1_3 (constraint 4 satisfied for the future: p1 in l1_3 before p2 will be in l2_1)
16. Move t1 with p1 and p2 to l1_5
17. Unload p1 and p2 from t1 at l1_5
18. Load p1 and p2 onto t1 at l1_5 (redundant, but added for clarity)
19. Move t1 with p1 and p2 to l1_1
20. Unload p1 and p2 from t1 at l1_1
21. Load p1 and p2 onto a1 at l1_1
22. Fly a1 with p1 and p2 to l2_1
23. Unload p2 from a1 at l2_1 (goal for p2 achieved and constraint 3 satisfied: p2 in l2_1)
24. Move t2 from l2_1 to l2_4
25. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1
26. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_1
27. Move t2 with p1 to l2_5 (constraint 9 satisfied: p1 in l2_5)
28. Move t2 with p1 to l2_4 (goal for p1 achieved)

Actually, I've noticed that some of the actions in the plan don't make sense because of the order or the location. Let me reorganize and refine the plan:

1. Move t2 from l2_5 to l2_2
2. Load p1 and p2 onto t2 at l2_2
3. Move t2 with p1 and p2 to l2_3 (constraint 6 satisfied: p2 in l2_3 after p1 was in l2_2)
4. Move t2 with p1 and p2 to l2_1
5. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1
6. Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1
7. Fly a2 with p1 to l1_1
8. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1
9. Load p1 onto a1 at l1_1 (constraint 2 satisfied: p1 in a1)
10. Move t1 from l1_3 to l1_1
11. Unload p1 from a1 at l1_1
12. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_1
13. Move t1 with p1 to l1_2 (constraint 8 satisfied: p1 in l1_2 after p2 was in l2_2)
14. Move t1 with p1 to l1_3 (constraint 4 satisfied for the future: p1 in l1_3 before p2 will be in l2_1)
15. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1
16. Move t2 with p2 to l2_4 (constraint 1 satisfied: p2 in l2_4)
17. Move t2 with p2 to l2_5
18. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_5
19. Move t2 back to l2_1
20. Load p2 onto a2 at l2_1
21. Fly a2 with p2 to l1_1
22. Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1
23. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_1 (constraint 10 partially satisfied: p2 in t1)
24. Move t1 with p1 and p2 to l1_5
25. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_5 (constraint 10 fully satisfied: p2 in l1_5)
26. Load p2 back onto t1 at l1_5
27. Move t1 with p1 and p2 to l1_1
28. Unload p1 and p2 from t1 at l1_1
29. Load p1 and p2 onto a1 at l1_1
30. Fly a1 with p1 and p2 to l2_1
31. Unload p2 from a1 at l2_1 (goal for p2 achieved and constraint 3 satisfied: p2 in l2_1)
32. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1

Wait, there's something weird in the plan. Let me carefully rethink and step through things from the beginning.

The initial state:
- p1 is in l2_2
- p2 is in l2_2
- t1 is in l1_3
- t2 is in l2_5
- a1 is in l1_1
- a2 is in l2_1

I'll track the constraints as I go along:
- Constraint 5: "p1 is in l2_2" is already satisfied in the initial state.
- Constraint 7: "p2 is in l2_2" is already satisfied in the initial state.

Now, because of constraint 6, after p1 is in l2_2 (which is true initially), either p2 should be in l1_4 or p2 should be in l2_3 at some point. Similarly, because of constraint 8, after p2 is in l2_2 (which is true initially), either p1 should be in l1_2 or p2 should be in l1_3 at some point.

Let's build a plan:
1. Move t2 from l2_5 to l2_2
2. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_2
3. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_2
4. Move t2 with p1 and p2 to l2_3 (constraint 6 satisfied: p2 in l2_3 after p1 was in l2_2)
5. Move t2 with p1 and p2 to l2_5 (constraint 9 satisfied: p1 in l2_5)
6. Move t2 with p1 and p2 to l2_4 (constraint 1 satisfied: p2 in l2_4)
7. Move t2 with p1 and p2 to l2_1
8. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1
9. Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1
10. Fly a2 with p1 to l1_1
11. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1
12. Load p1 onto a1 at l1_1 (constraint 2 satisfied: p1 in a1)
13. Unload p1 from a1 at l1_1
14. Move t1 from l1_3 to l1_2
15. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_2 (constraint 8 satisfied: p1 in l1_2 after p2 was in l2_2)
16. Move t1 with p1 to l1_3 (constraint 4 satisfied for the future: p1 in l1_3 before p2 will be in l2_1)
17. Move t1 with p1 to l1_5

Wait, there's an issue. How can I move p1 to l1_2 if it has been unloaded at l1_1? The actions are inconsistent. Let me carefully redo this.

I should try to satisy the constraints as I go and keep a clear track of where the packages are.

Initial state:
- p1 is in l2_2
- p2 is in l2_2
- t1 is in l1_3
- t2 is in l2_5
- a1 is in l1_1
- a2 is in l2_1

Constraints 5 & 7 are already satisfied. Let's build a coherent plan:

1. Move t2 from l2_5 to l2_2
2. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_2
3. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_2
4. Move t2 with p1 and p2 to l2_3 (constraint 6 satisfied: p2 in l2_3 after p1 was in l2_2)
5. Move t2 with p1 and p2 to l2_4 (constraint 1 satisfied: p2 in l2_4)
6. Move t2 with p1 and p2 to l2_5 (constraint 9 satisfied: p1 in l2_5)
7. Move t2 with p1 and p2 to l2_1
8. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1
9. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1
10. Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1
11. Fly a2 with p1 to l1_1
12. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1
13. Load p1 onto a1 at l1_1 (constraint 2 satisfied: p1 in a1)
14. Unload p1 from a1 at l1_1
15. Move t1 from l1_3 to l1_1
16. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_1
17. Move t1 with p1 to l1_2 (constraint 8 satisfied: p1 in l1_2 after p2 was in l2_2)
18. Move t1 with p1 to l1_3 (constraint 4 satisfied for the future: p1 in l1_3 before p2 will be in l2_1)
19. Move t1 with p1 to l1_5
20. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_5
21. Fly a2 from l1_1 to l2_1
22. Load p2 onto a2 at l2_1
23. Fly a2 with p2 to l1_1
24. Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1
25. Move t1 from l1_5 to l1_1
26. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_1
27. Move t1 with p2 to l1_5 (constraint 10 satisfied: p2 in l1_5)
28. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_5
29. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_5
30. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_5
31. Move t1 with p1 and p2 to l1_1
32. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1
33. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1
34. Load p1 onto a1 at l1_1
35. Load p2 onto a1 at l1_1
36. Fly a1 with p1 and p2 to l2_1
37. Unload p2 from a1 at l2_1 (goal for p2 achieved and constraint 3 satisfied: p2 in l2_1)
38. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1
39. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_1
40. Move t2 with p1 to l2_4 (goal for p1 achieved)

Step 28, 29, 30 contain redundant operations. Let me streamline:

1. Move t2 from l2_5 to l2_2
2. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_2
3. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_2
4. Move t2 with p1 and p2 to l2_3 (constraint 6 satisfied: p2 in l2_3 after p1 was in l2_2)
5. Move t2 with p1 and p2 to l2_4 (constraint 1 satisfied: p2 in l2_4)
6. Move t2 with p1 and p2 to l2_5 (constraint 9 satisfied: p1 in l2_5)
7. Move t2 with p1 and p2 to l2_1
8. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1
9. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1
10. Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1
11. Fly a2 with p1 to l1_1
12. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1
13. Load p1 onto a1 at l1_1 (constraint 2 satisfied: p1 in a1)
14. Unload p1 from a1 at l1_1
15. Move t1 from l1_3 to l1_1
16. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_1
17. Move t1 with p1 to l1_2 (constraint 8 satisfied: p1 in l1_2 after p2 was in l2_2)
18. Move t1 with p1 to l1_3 (constraint 4 satisfied for the future: p1 in l1_3 before p2 will be in l2_1)
19. Move t1 with p1 to l1_5
20. Fly a2 from l1_1 to l2_1
21. Load p2 onto a2 at l2_1
22. Fly a2 with p2 to l1_1
23. Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1
24. Move t1 from l1_5 to l1_1
25. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_1
26. Move t1 with p1 and p2 to l1_5 (constraint 10 satisfied: p2 in l1_5)
27. Move t1 with p1 and p2 to l1_1
28. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1
29. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1
30. Load p1 onto a1 at l1_1
31. Load p2 onto a1 at l1_1
32. Fly a1 with p1 and p2 to l2_1
33. Unload p2 from a1 at l2_1 (goal for p2 achieved and constraint 3 satisfied: p2 in l2_1)
34. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1
35. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_1
36. Move t2 with p1 to l2_4 (goal for p1 achieved)

Actually, there are some issues with the above plan. Let me more carefully go through the actions and ensure they are valid.

Hmm, I feel like I'm making this more complex than it needs to be. Let me reconsider the constraints and see if I can come up with a more streamlined plan.

Let me first see if I really need to move both packages to city c1:

- For constraint 8 (after p2 is in l2_2, either p1 in l1_2 or p2 in l1_3), I need to move p1 to l1_2 or p2 to l1_3. Let's go with moving p1 to l1_2.
- For constraint 2 (p1 in a1 at some point), I need to have p1 and a1 in the same location. Since a1 starts in l1_1, I can have p1 in l1_1 as well.
- For constraint 4 (before p2 is in l2_1, p1 should be in l1_3 or l2_3), I need to move p1 to l1_3 or l2_3. Since I'm already planning to move p1 to l1_2, it makes sense to also move it to l1_3.
- For constraint 10 (p2 in t1 or p2 in l1_5 at some point), I need to move p2 to city c1 as well.

So, it seems like I need to move both packages to city c1 to satisfy all the constraints. 

Let me rework the plan:

1. Move t2 from l2_5 to l2_2
2. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_2
3. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_2
4. Move t2 with p1 and p2 to l2_3 (constraint 6 satisfied: p2 in l2_3 after p1 was in l2_2)
5. Move t2 with p1 and p2 to l2_4 (constraint 1 satisfied: p2 in l2_4)
6. Move t2 with p1 and p2 to l2_5 (constraint 9 satisfied: p1 in l2_5)
7. Move t2 with p1 and p2 to l2_1
8. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1
9. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1
10. Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1
11. Load p2 onto a2 at l2_1
12. Fly a2 with p1 and p2 to l1_1
13. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1
14. Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1
15. Load p1 onto a1 at l1_1 (constraint 2 satisfied: p1 in a1)
16. Unload p1 from a1 at l1_1
17. Move t1 from l1_3 to l1_1
18. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_1
19. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_1 (constraint 10 partially satisfied: p2 in t1)
20. Move t1 with p1 and p2 to l1_2 (constraint 8 satisfied: p1 in l1_2 after p2 was in l2_2)
21. Move t1 with p1 and p2 to l1_3 (constraint 4 satisfied for the future: p1 in l1_3 before p2 will be in l2_1)
22. Move t1 with p1 and p2 to l1_5 (constraint 10 fully satisfied: p2 in l1_5)
23. Move t1 with p1 and p2 to l1_1
24. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1
25. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1
26. Load p1 onto a1 at l1_1
27. Load p2 onto a1 at l1_1
28. Fly a1 with p1 and p2 to l2_1
29. Unload p2 from a1 at l2_1 (goal for p2 achieved and constraint 3 satisfied: p2 in l2_1)
30. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1
31. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_1
32. Move t2 with p1 to l2_4 (goal for p1 achieved)

This should be a valid plan. Let me check if all the constraints are satisfied:

1. "Package p2 is in location l2_4" at some point: Satisfied in step 5.
2. "Package p1 is in a1" at some point: Satisfied in step 15.
3. "Package p2 is in location l2_1" at some point: Satisfied in step 29.
4. If "Package p2 is in location l2_1", then at some earlier point, "Package p1 is in location l1_3" or "Package p1 is in location l2_3": Satisfied in step 21 (p1 is in l1_3) before step 29 (p2 is in l2_1).
5. "Package p1 is in location l2_2" at some point: Satisfied in the initial state.
6. If "Package p1 is in location l2_2", then at that point or later, "Package p2 is in location l1_4" or "Package p2 is in location l2_3": Satisfied in step 4 (p2 is in l2_3) after p1 was in l2_2 in the initial state.
7. "Package p2 is in location l2_2" at some point: Satisfied in the initial state.
8. If "Package p2 is in location l2_2", then at that point or later, "Package p1 is in location l1_2" or "Package p2 is in location l1_3": Satisfied in step 20 (p1 is in l1_2) after p2 was in l2_2 in the initial state.
9. "Package p1 is in location l2_5" at some point: Satisfied in step 6.
10. "At least one of the following conditions is true: Package p2 is in t1", "Package p2 is in location l1_5"" at some point: Satisfied in steps 19 (p2 is in t1) and 22 (p2 is in l1_5).

All constraints are satisfied, and the goals are achieved at the end of the plan. I believe this is a valid plan.

Let me now translate each action to the format requested:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
3. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
4. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
5. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
6. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2
7. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
8. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
9. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
10. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
11. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
12. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
13. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
14. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
15. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
16. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
17. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
18. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
19. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
20. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
21. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1
22. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_5 c1
23. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
24. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
25. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
26. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
27. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
28. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
29. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
30. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
31. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
32. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2

Ah, I see a problem. In the original problem description, one action is defined incorrectly:
"unloadairplane p ap l": Unload package p from airplane ap in location l.

Let me correct step 16, and all other similar steps:
16. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

Let me check for any other errors in the plan.

I think there's a problem with step 11 and 12. I plan to load both p1 and p2 onto a2, but a2 starts in l2_1 and needs to go to l1_1. However, after I load p1 onto a2, I plan to fly a2 with p1, but then I'm also planning to load p2 onto a2. This doesn't make sense chronologically.

Let's reorganize:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
3. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
4. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
5. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
6. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2
7. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
8. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
9. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
10. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
11. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
12. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
13. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
14. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
15. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
16. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
17. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
18. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
19. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
20. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
21. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1
22. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_5 c1
23. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
24. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
25. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
26. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
27. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
28. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
29. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
30. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
31. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
32. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2

Actually, there's another issue with steps 15 and 16. I'm planning to load p1 onto a1 and then immediately unload it. This doesn't make logical sense and is inefficient.

Let me review the constraint 2: "Package p1 is in a1" at some point.

I can place this action at a more strategic point in the plan, such as right before flying a1 to l2_1.

Let's reorganize again:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
3. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
4. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
5. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
6. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2
7. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
8. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
9. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
10. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
11. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
12. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
13. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
14. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
15. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
16. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
17. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
18. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
19. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1
20. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_5 c1
21. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
22. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
23. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
24. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (constraint 2 satisfied: p1 is in a1)
25. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
26. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
27. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (goal for p2 achieved and constraint 3 satisfied: p2 is in l2_1)
28. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
29. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
30. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2 (goal for p1 achieved)

This should be a valid plan now. Let me go through the constraints once more to make sure:

1. "Package p2 is in location l2_4" at some point: Satisfied in step 5.
2. "Package p1 is in a1" at some point: Satisfied in step 24.
3. "Package p2 is in location l2_1" at some point: Satisfied in step 27.
4. If "Package p2 is in location l2_1", then at some earlier point, "Package p1 is in location l1_3" or "Package p1 is in location l2_3": Satisfied in step 19 (p1 is in l1_3) before step 27 (p2 is in l2_1).
5. "Package p1 is in location l2_2" at some point: Satisfied in the initial state.
6. If "Package p1 is in location l2_2", then at that point or later, "Package p2 is in location l1_4" or "Package p2 is in location l2_3": Satisfied in step 4 (p2 is in l2_3) after p1 was in l2_2 in the initial state.
7. "Package p2 is in location l2_2" at some point: Satisfied in the initial state.
8. If "Package p2 is in location l2_2", then at that point or later, "Package p1 is in location l1_2" or "Package p2 is in location l1_3": Satisfied in step 18 (p1 is in l1_2) after p2 was in l2_2 in the initial state.
9. "Package p1 is in location l2_5" at some point: Satisfied in step 6.
10. "At least one of the following conditions is true: Package p2 is in t1", "Package p2 is in location l1_5"" at some point: Satisfied in step 17 (p2 is in t1) and step 20 (p2 is in l1_5).

All constraints are satisfied, and the goals are achieved at the end of the plan. I believe this is a valid plan.

The final sequence of actions is:
1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
3. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
4. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
5. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
6. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2
7. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
8. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
9. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
10. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
11. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
12. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
13. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
14. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
15. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
16. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
17. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
18. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
19. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1
20. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_5 c1
21. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
22. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
23. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
24. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
25. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
26. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
27. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
28. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
29. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
30. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2

This seems to be a valid and optimized plan for the given problem.
