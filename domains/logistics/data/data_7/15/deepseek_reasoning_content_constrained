Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. First, I need to understand the initial state, the goal, and all the constraints. The goal is to get both p1 and p2 to l1_3. The initial positions are p1 at l1_1 and p2 at l1_2. 

Looking at the constraints, there are several that p2 must go through specific locations. For example, p2 must be in l1_1, l1_4, l1_3, l1_2, and also be in a2 at some point. Also, when p2 is in l1_3, there must have been a prior state where it was in l1_1 or l2_5. Additionally, if p2 is in l1_2 in some state, then either p1 is in l1_2 or p2 is in l2_1 at that state or later. Another constraint is that either p2 is in l1_4 or p1 is in l2_5 at some point, and p1 must be in l2_3 at some state.

Hmm. Let's start with p1. It needs to end up in l1_3. Currently, it's at l1_1, which is an airport in c1. The truck t1 is also at l1_1. So maybe we can load p1 into t1, drive t1 to l1_3, then unload. But wait, the initial state says "Package t1 is in location l1_1". Wait, no—the problem mentions that the objects include trucks t1 and t2. The original state lists "Package t1 is in location l1_1"—wait, that must be a typo. Because t1 is a truck, not a package. Oh, maybe the original state has a mistake. Let me check again.

Wait, the original state says:

"Package t1 is in location l1_1"
"Package t2 is in location l2_4"
"Package p1 is in location l1_1"
"Package p2 is in location l1_2"
"Package a1 is in location l1_1"
"Package a2 is in location l2_1"

Wait, that can't be right. Because t1 and t2 are trucks, a1 and a2 are airplanes, so they shouldn't be listed as packages. This must be an error in the problem description. But assuming that's a typo, perhaps it's meant to say that the trucks and airplanes are in those locations. For example:

Truck t1 is in l1_1, Truck t2 is in l2_4, Airplane a1 is in l1_1, Airplane a2 is in l2_1.

Yes, that makes more sense. So the initial state probably has:

- t1 (truck) at l1_1 (airport in c1)
- t2 (truck) at l2_4 (in c2)
- a1 (airplane) at l1_1 (airport)
- a2 (airplane) at l2_1 (airport)
- p1 at l1_1
- p2 at l1_2.

So, the initial positions are:

Packages:
p1: l1_1 (c1)
p2: l1_2 (c1)

Trucks:
t1: l1_1 (c1)
t2: l2_4 (c2)

Airplanes:
a1: l1_1 (c1)
a2: l2_1 (c2)

Now, the goal is p1 and p2 both at l1_3 (c1).

Constraints:

1. p2 must be in l1_1 at some state.
2. p2 must be in l1_4 at some state.
3. p2 must be in l1_3 (the goal).
4. If p2 is in l1_3, then before that, it must have been in l1_1 or l2_5.
5. p2 must be in a2 at some state.
6. p2 must be in l1_2 (which is its initial location, but maybe after moving? Wait, the initial state is p2 at l1_2. So if the plan starts with moving it elsewhere, then coming back, maybe that's needed for the constraint. Because the constraint says "must hold in at least one state"—so if it's already there at the start, does that count? If the initial state counts, then maybe that's satisfied. But perhaps the constraints require that during the plan, p2 is in l1_2 again. The problem states "must hold in at least one state"—so the initial state is a state. So if p2 is in l1_2 initially, then that's already satisfied. But the next constraint is: if p2 is in l1_2 in some state s, then in s or later, either p1 is in l1_2 or p2 is in l2_1. So since the initial state has p2 in l1_2, we need to ensure that either p1 is in l1_2 in the initial state (which it's not) or p2 ends up in l2_1 at some point. Wait, but the initial state is s0. So in s0, p2 is in l1_2. Therefore, the constraint requires that in s0 or a later state, either p1 is in l1_2 or p2 is in l2_1. So since p2 is in l1_2 in s0, we need to make sure that either p1 gets to l1_2 at some point (maybe in the plan) or p2 goes to l2_1. But looking at the other constraints, we also need p2 to be in a2 at some point. How can we get p2 to l2_1? That's an airport in c2. So perhaps we need to fly a2 from l2_1 to another airport, but p2 is in c1. Hmm. This seems complex.

Let's break down the constraints one by one.

First, for p1's constraints:

- Must be in l2_3 at some state. l2_3 is in c2. So p1 needs to be transported to c2. But how? Because trucks can't move between cities. So to get p1 from c1 to c2, we need to use an airplane. So load p1 into a1 at l1_1, fly a1 to l2_1 (the airport in c2), then unload p1 there. Then, use a truck in c2 (t2 is in l2_4) to move p1 to l2_3. But the goal is to have p1 back in l1_3. So after moving p1 to l2_3 (to satisfy the constraint), we need to bring it back to c1. That's a lot of steps.

But maybe there's a smarter way. Let's think.

Constraints for p2:

- Must be in a2 (which is in l2_1 initially). So to get p2 into a2, we need to get p2 to l2_1. But p2 starts in l1_2 (c1). How to get p2 to l2_1? Since trucks can't move between cities, we need to use an airplane. So load p2 into a1 in c1, fly a1 to l2_1, unload p2 into a2 (maybe?), but how? Wait, a2 is at l2_1. So maybe load p2 into a2 at l2_1. Wait, but to do that, p2 needs to be at l2_1. So perhaps:

1. Move p2 from l1_2 to l1_1 (using truck t1), then load into a1.
2. Fly a1 to l2_1.
3. Unload p2 from a1 into l2_1.
4. Load p2 into a2 at l2_1 (so p2 is in a2, satisfying the constraint).
5. Then fly a2 somewhere else? Or maybe unload p2 from a2 back into l2_1, then fly a1 back to c1 with p2?

But the goal is to have p2 in l1_3. So after getting p2 into a2, we need to transport it back to c1.

Alternatively, maybe after step 3 (unload p2 into l2_1), then load it into a2 (satisfies "p2 is in a2"), then fly a2 to another airport. But l1_1 is in c1. So fly a2 to l1_1, unload p2 there, then use t1 to take it to l1_3.

But this seems complicated. Let's also consider the other constraints.

Another constraint: "if p2 is in l1_2 in some state s, then in s or after, either p1 is in l1_2 or p2 is in l2_1". Since p2 starts in l1_2 (s0), we need to ensure that either p1 gets to l1_2 or p2 gets to l2_1. But if we move p2 out of l1_2 in the first step, then the state s0 is still valid, but the constraint requires that in s0 or after, one of the conditions holds. Since in s0, neither p1 is in l1_2 nor p2 is in l2_1, but the constraint is about if p2 is in l1_2 in s, then in s or later... So since s0 is a state where p2 is in l1_2, we need that either p1 is in l1_2 at s0 or later, or p2 is in l2_1 at s0 or later. Since p1 is not in l1_2 in s0, we need p2 to reach l2_1 at some point. So p2 must be in l2_1 at some state. That's another constraint to satisfy.

Wait, but the constraint about p2 being in l2_1 isn't directly listed, but the implication is that if p2 is in l1_2 (as in s0), then eventually p2 must be in l2_1 or p1 must be in l1_2. Since p1's goal is in l1_3, maybe we can't have p1 in l1_2. So we need to get p2 to l2_1.

So to satisfy that, p2 must be in l2_1 at some state. But how? Since l2_1 is in c2, which is a different city. So we need to use an airplane to transport p2 from c1 to c2.

So steps for p2:

1. Move p2 from l1_2 to l1_1 (using truck t1). Then load into airplane a1.
2. Fly a1 to l2_1 (c2's airport).
3. Unload p2 into l2_1. Now p2 is in l2_1, which helps with the constraint.
4. Then, to get p2 into a2 (another constraint), load it into a2 at l2_1.
5. Now p2 is in a2. Then, fly a2 back to l1_1? Wait, can airplanes fly between any airports? Yes. So fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1. Then unload p2 into l1_1. Then use truck t1 to drive to l1_3.

But this would require a2 to be at l2_1 initially, which it is. So possible.

But also, the constraint that p2 must be in l1_4. So after bringing p2 back to c1, maybe drive it to l1_4 first, then to l1_3.

But let's outline this.

For p2:

- Start at l1_2 (c1)
- Load into t1 (needs t1 to be at l1_2. But initially, t1 is at l1_1. So first, drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_2. Then load p2 into t1. Then drive t1 to l1_1. Unload p2 at l1_1. Then load into a1. Fly a1 to l2_1. Unload p2. Load into a2. Fly a2 back to l1_1. Unload. Then drive t1 to l1_3, but p2 is at l1_1. So load into t1 again, drive to l1_3, unload.

But this seems long, but necessary to meet the constraints.

But let's check all constraints:

1. p2 in l1_1: achieved when moving from l1_2 to l1_1.

2. p2 in l1_4: So after bringing p2 back to c1 (say to l1_1), then drive t1 to l1_4, unload p2 there, then load again and drive to l1_3.

3. p2 in l1_3: the goal.

4. When p2 is in l1_3, before that, it was in l1_1 (from the previous steps), so that's satisfied.

5. p2 in a2: achieved when loaded into a2 at l2_1.

6. p2 in l1_2: initial state, but maybe after moving it elsewhere and back? Wait, no, the initial state already counts. But the problem says "must hold in at least one state", so initial state is okay. But the constraint says if p2 is in l1_2 (as in s0), then in that state or later, either p1 is in l1_2 or p2 is in l2_1. Since we have p2 in l2_1 in a later state, that's satisfied.

7. The OR constraint: either p2 in l1_4 or p1 in l2_5. We have p2 in l1_4, so that's covered.

8. p1 in l2_3: Need to get p1 to l2_3. Since p1 starts in l1_1 (c1), we need to fly it to c2. Load p1 into a1 at l1_1, fly to l2_1, unload. Then use truck t2 (which is in l2_4) to drive to l2_3. But wait, t2 is in l2_4 (c2), so drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_3 (since they are in the same city). So steps:

For p1:

- Load into a1 at l1_1.
- Fly a1 to l2_1.
- Unload p1 into l2_1.
- Load into t2 (drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1? Or is t2 already at l2_4. Wait, initial state: t2 is in l2_4. So to get to l2_1, which is in c2, the truck can drive. But l2_1 is an airport. So drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1. Then load p1 into t2. Then drive to l2_3. Unload p1. Then bring it back to c1 to reach the goal.

But this complicates the plan. Let's see.

So p1's path:

1. Load into a1 at l1_1.
2. Fly a1 to l2_1.
3. Unload p1 into l2_1.
4. Load into t2 (needs t2 to be at l2_1. So drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
   Action: drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
5. Load p1 into t2.
6. Drive t2 to l2_3.
7. Unload p1 into l2_3 (satisfies the constraint).
8. Then, to get p1 back to c1, load into a2 (since a2 is at l2_1, but after flying to l2_1?), but a2 would have been used for p2. Hmm. Wait, this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, after p1 is in l2_3, we need to fly it back to c1. So load into a2 (if a2 is available). But a2 is initially at l2_1. So after unloading p1 into l2_3, we need to get it back to l2_1, load into a2, fly to l1_1, then use t1 to drive to l1_3.

But this adds more steps. This is getting quite involved. Let's outline the full plan.

Possible steps:

For p2:

1. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_2 (c1). Pre: t1 at l1_1. Action: drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1.
2. Load p2 into t1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2.
3. Drive t1 to l1_1. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1. Now p2 is in t1 at l1_1.
4. Unload p2 at l1_1. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1. Now p2 is at l1_1 (satisfies constraint 1).
5. Load p2 into a1. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1.
6. Fly a1 to l2_1. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1. Now a1 and p2 are at l2_1.
7. Unload p2 from a1 into l2_1. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1.
8. Load p2 into a2 (which is at l2_1). loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1. Now p2 is in a2 (satisfies constraint 5).
9. Fly a2 to l1_1. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.
10. Unload p2 from a2 into l1_1. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1.
11. Load p2 into t1 (which is at l1_1). loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.
12. Drive t1 to l1_4. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1. Now p2 is in t1 at l1_4.
13. Unload p2 at l1_4. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (satisfies constraint 2).
14. Load p2 into t1 again. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4.
15. Drive t1 to l1_3. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1.
16. Unload p2 at l1_3. (satisfies constraint 3 and part of the goal.)

For p1:

1. Load into a1 at l1_1. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1. (But a1 was used to transport p2 to l2_1, so need to check the timing. Wait, after step 6, a1 is at l2_1. So to load p1 into a1, we need to bring a1 back to l1_1. So steps:

After step 6 (a1 at l2_1):

7. Unload p2 from a1 (step 7 above).
Then, fly a1 back to l1_1. So insert after step 7:

7a. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1.
But this is after unloading p2. So after step 7, a1 is at l2_1. To fly back, need to have a1 fly from l2_1 to l1_1.

But then, after step 7, a1 is empty at l2_1. So:

7. Unload p2 from a1 into l2_1.
8. Fly a1 back to l1_1. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1.
9. Now, load p1 into a1 at l1_1. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1.
10. Fly a1 to l2_1 again. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1.
11. Unload p1 into l2_1. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1.
12. Load p1 into t2 (but t2 is in l2_4. Need to drive t2 to l2_1. So:
13. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2.
14. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1.
15. Drive t2 to l2_3. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2.
16. Unload p1 into l2_3. (satisfies constraint 8: p1 is in l2_3.)
17. Now, to get p1 back to c1. Load into a2 (which is at l2_1?), but a2 was used for p2. After step 9, a2 is at l1_1. Hmm, this is getting too complex. Maybe another approach.

Alternatively, after p1 is in l2_3, use a different airplane to fly back. But the only other airplane is a2, which may be at l1_1 after transporting p2. Let's see:

After step 10 (a2 is at l1_1), we can fly a2 to l2_1 again to pick up p1. But p1 is in l2_3. So need to get p1 from l2_3 to l2_1.

But this is getting very involved. Let's think of a more efficient way.

Alternative plan:

Handle p1 first. Get p1 to l2_3, then back to c1.

But given the constraints, maybe combining some steps.

Wait, but the constraints for p1 are:

- Must be in l2_3 at some state.

But the goal is to have p1 in l1_3. So we can send p1 to l2_3, then bring it back.

But that would require:

For p1:

1. Load into a1 at l1_1.
2. Fly a1 to l2_1.
3. Unload into l2_1.
4. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
5. Load p1 into t2.
6. Drive to l2_3, unload. (satisfies constraint)
7. Then load back into t2, drive to l2_1.
8. Load into a1 again.
9. Fly back to l1_1.
10. Unload into l1_1.
11. Then load into t1, drive to l1_3.

But how does this fit with the p2 steps?

This is getting really complicated. Maybe there's a way to combine the steps.

Alternatively, since p1 needs to be in l2_3 once, maybe during the transportation of p2, we can take p1 along. But p1 starts at l1_1. Let's see.

But the problem requires an optimal plan with minimal steps. So let's try to find the shortest possible path that meets all constraints.

Alternative approach for p2:

1. From l1_2 (initial), drive t1 to l1_2 (but t1 starts at l1_1).

Action 1: drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1.

Now t1 is at l1_2.

Action 2: loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2.

Action 3: drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1.

Now p2 is in t1 at l1_1.

Action4: unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1. Now p2 is in l1_1 (satisfies constraint 1).

Action5: loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1.

Action6: flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1.

Now p2 is in a1 at l2_1.

Action7: unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1.

Now p2 is at l2_1.

Action8: loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1. (satisfies constraint 5: p2 in a2)

Action9: flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

Action10: unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1.

Now p2 is back at l1_1.

Action11: loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

Action12: drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1.

Unload p2 at l1_4 (satisfies constraint 2).

Action13: unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4.

Action14: loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4.

Action15: drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1.

Action16: unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3. Now p2 is at goal.

For p1:

Need to get to l2_3 and back.

Action (interleaved with p2 steps):

After Action6 (a1 at l2_1):

Action7: flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1. (But a1 is at l2_1 after step6. Wait, step6 is fly a1 to l2_1. So after step6, a1 is at l2_1. To get p1, we need to bring a1 back to l1_1. So after step6 (Action6: fly a1 to l2_1), then after unloading p2 (Action7: unload p2 from a1 at l2_1), fly a1 back to l1_1.

So:

Action7: unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1.

Action8: flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1.

Now a1 is back at l1_1. Load p1 into a1.

Action9: loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1.

Action10: flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1.

Action11: unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1.

Now p1 is at l2_1. Need to get to l2_3.

Action12: drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2.

Action13: loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1.

Action14: drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2.

Action15: unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3. (satisfies constraint 8)

Now, to get p1 back to c1:

Action16: drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2.

Action17: loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1.

Action18: drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2. (Not sure why, maybe not necessary.)

Alternatively, after p1 is at l2_3, load into a2 (if available). But a2 is at l2_1 after step9 (Action9: fly a2 to l1_1?), but earlier steps for p2 involved a2 flying to l1_1 (Action9: flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1). Wait, in the p2 steps, after Action8 (load p2 into a2 at l2_1), then Action9 is fly a2 to l1_1. So a2 is now at l1_1. So to get p1 from l2_3 to c1, maybe use a different airplane. But there's only a1 and a2. a1 is at l2_1 after step10 (fly a1 to l2_1). So after step10, a1 is at l2_1 again. So unload p1 there, then load into a1 again. Wait, this is getting too tangled.

Alternatively, after p1 is unloaded at l2_3 (Action15), fly a1 (which was at l2_1 after step10) to l2_3? Wait, airplanes can only fly between airports. l2_3 is not an airport. So a1 can't fly to l2_3. So to get p1 from l2_3 to an airport in c2 (l2_1), we need to use a truck. So after Action15 (p1 at l2_3), drive t2 to l2_3, load p1, drive back to l2_1, unload, then load into a1, fly to l1_1.

So:

Action16: drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2.

Action17: loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3.

Action18: drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2.

Action19: unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1.

Action20: loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1.

Action21: flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1.

Action22: unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1.

Now p1 is back at l1_1. Then load into t1 and drive to l1_3.

Action23: loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1.

Action24: drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1.

Action25: unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3.

But this is a lot of steps and may not be optimal. Also, need to check all constraints are met.

Let's check the constraints:

1. p2 in l1_1: yes, after step4.
2. p2 in l1_4: yes, after step13.
3. p2 in l1_3: yes, step16.
4. Before p2 is in l1_3, it was in l1_1 (step4), which satisfies the condition.
5. p2 in a2: step8.
6. p2 in l1_2: initial state.
7. If p2 is in l1_2 (s0), then in s0 or later, p1 in l1_2 or p2 in l2_1. We have p2 in l2_1 at step7.
8. Either p2 in l1_4 (step13) or p1 in l2_5. Since p2 is in l1_4, this is satisfied.
9. p1 in l2_3: step15.

Other constraints:

The OR constraint after p2 is in l1_2 (s0) requires that either p1 is in l1_2 or p2 in l2_1. Since p2 reaches l2_1 in step7, this is satisfied.

So all constraints are met.

Now, combining the steps for p1 and p2, but interleaving them in the correct order to minimize steps.

But the problem requires an optimal plan, i.e., the shortest possible. Let's try to see if some steps can be merged or done in parallel.

For example, after p2 is loaded into a1 (Action5), fly a1 to l2_1 (Action6), then unload p2 (Action7). Then fly a1 back to l1_1 (Action8), load p1 (Action9), fly to l2_1 (Action10), unload p1 (Action11). Then drive t2 to l2_1 (Action12), load p1 (Action13), drive to l2_3 (Action14), unload (Action15). Then bring p1 back.

Meanwhile, after p2 is in l1_1 (Action4), steps for p2 continue.

But this interleaving may lead to a long plan. Let's count the steps.

Total steps for p2:

16 actions (steps 1-16 for p2).

Total steps for p1: 25 steps? No, the steps for p1 would be after Action8 (fly a1 back), etc. But this is getting too long.

Alternatively, maybe there's a more optimal way. Let's think differently.

What if we use a different approach for p1:

Instead of sending p1 to l2_3 via airplane, can we use a truck in c2 to move it from l2_1 to l2_3? But p1 starts in c1, so we need to fly it to c2 first.

Steps for p1:

1. load into a1 at l1_1.

2. fly to l2_1.

3. unload into l2_1.

4. drive t2 to l2_1.

5. load into t2.

6. drive to l2_3.

7. unload (satisfies constraint).

8. drive back to l2_1.

9. load into a1.

10. fly back to l1_1.

11. unload.

12. load into t1.

13. drive to l1_3.

That's 13 steps for p1.

But combining with p2's steps, some actions may overlap. For example, when a1 is used for p2 and then for p1.

But this seems time-consuming. Let's try to find the minimal steps.

Alternative idea: Use a2 to transport p1 back. After a2 is used to bring p2 back to l1_1 (step10), then a2 can fly to l2_1 to pick up p1.

But this may require additional steps.

Alternatively, after p1 is in l2_3 (step15), use a2 to fly from l1_1 to l2_1, load p1, fly back. But a2 is at l1_1 after step10 (fly a2 to l1_1). So:

After step10 (a2 at l1_1):

Action11: fly a2 to l2_1.

Action12: load p1 into a2 at l2_1.

Action13: fly back to l1_1.

Action14: unload p1.

Then load into t1 and drive to l1_3.

But how does p1 get from l2_3 to l2_1? Need to use truck t2.

So:

Action15: drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_3.

Action16: load p1 into t2.

Action17: drive to l2_1.

Action18: unload p1.

Then load into a2, fly to l1_1.

This adds more steps.

Given the complexity, perhaps the minimal plan involves around 20 steps, but I'm not sure. However, the problem requires an optimal plan, so maybe there's a shorter way.

Wait, perhaps the key is to combine the steps where possible.

For example, when a1 is flown to l2_1 with p2, then after unloading p2, a1 can immediately fly back to l1_1 with p1.

But let's see:

1. load p2 into a1 (l1_1).
2. fly to l2_1.
3. unload p2.
4. load p1 into a1 (but a1 is at l2_1, and p1 is at l1_1. So this isn't possible. Wait, p1 is at l1_1, so to load into a1, a1 needs to be at l1_1. So after step3, fly a1 back to l1_1.

So:

Action1: loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 → no, initial steps are different.

Alternatively, this approach is not working. 

Another idea: Since both p1 and p2 need to end up in l1_3, maybe transport them together where possible. But given their different constraints, this might not be feasible.

Let me try to outline a possible plan step by step, considering all constraints and trying to minimize actions.

Plan Steps:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1 (t1 moves to p2's location).

2. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (now p2 is in t1 at l1_2).

3. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 (bring p2 to l1_1).

4. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (p2 now in l1_1; satisfies constraint 1).

5. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (load into a1).

6. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (fly to c2's airport).

7. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (p2 at l2_1; helps with the constraint where if p2 was in l1_2, then eventually in l2_1).

8. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (now p2 is in a2; satisfies constraint 5).

9. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (bring p2 back to c1).

10. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (p2 at l1_1 again).

11. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (load into t1).

12. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1 (drive to l1_4; satisfies constraint 2 when unloaded).

13. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (p2 in l1_4; constraint 2 met).

14. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (reload to move to l1_3).

15. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1 (arrive at goal).

16. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (p2's goal met).

Now, for p1:

17. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (a1 was at l2_1 after step6. Wait, after step6, a1 is at l2_1. So step7 unloads p2 there, then step17 would require a1 to be back at l1_1. So after step7, need to fly a1 back to l1_1.

So insert after step7:

7a. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1.

Now, between steps 7 and 8:

7. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1.

7a. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1.

8. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1.

Wait, after step7a, a1 is back at l1_1. So step17 can be:

8. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1.

But step8 is currently load p2 into a2. Let's adjust the numbering.

After step7: unload p2 from a1 at l2_1.

Step8: fly a1 back to l1_1.

Step9: load p1 into a1.

Step10: fly a1 to l2_1.

Step11: unload p1 into l2_1.

Step12: drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2.

Step13: loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1.

Step14: drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2.

Step15: unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (constraint met).

Step16: drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2.

Step17: loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1.

Step18: unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1.

Step19: loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (a2 is at l2_1 after step9? Wait, a2 was flown to l1_1 in step9? No, step9 is fly a1 back. Step9 is fly a1 from l2_1 to l1_1. Then step10 is load p1 into a1 at l1_1, fly to l2_1 again. Then a2 is still at l2_1 until step9: fly a2 to l1_1.

Wait, the steps for p2 are:

1-7: p2 moves to l2_1.

7a. fly a1 back to l1_1.

8. load p2 into a2 (at l2_1).

9. fly a2 to l1_1.

So after step9, a2 is at l1_1. So p1 steps after step9:

10. load p1 into a1 at l1_1 (step10).

11. fly a1 to l2_1.

12. unload p1.

Then use t2 to move to l2_3.

But this is getting too long again.

An alternative approach to handle p1's constraint:

Use the same airplane (a1) to transport p1 after bringing p2 to l2_1.

So:

After step7 (unload p2 from a1 at l2_1):

Step8: fly a1 back to l1_1.

Step9: load p1 into a1.

Step10: fly a1 to l2_1.

Step11: unload p1 into l2_1.

Step12: drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.

Step13: load p1 into t2.

Step14: drive to l2_3.

Step15: unload p1 (constraint met).

Step16: drive t2 back to l2_1.

Step17: unload p1.

Step18: load into a1.

Step19: fly back to l1_1.

Step20: unload p1.

Step21: load into t1.

Step22: drive to l1_3.

Step23: unload p1.

Combining these steps with p2's steps:

Total actions would be around 23, which is a lot. But the problem requires an optimal plan. However, given the constraints, it's likely that this is the minimal plan.

But maybe there's a way to reuse some steps.

For example, when a2 is used to transport p2 back to l1_1 (step9), then a2 can be used to transport p1 back as well.

But p1 needs to be in l2_3 first. So after p1 is in l2_3, we can load it into a2 and fly back.

But I think this is the best possible approach given the constraints.

Putting it all together, the plan would look like:

```
1. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
2. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
3. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
4. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
5. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
6. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
7. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
8. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
9. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
10. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
11. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
12. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
13. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
14. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
15. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
16. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
17. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
18. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
19. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
20. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
21. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
22. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
23. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1
24. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
25. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
26. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
27. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
28. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
29. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
30. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
31. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
32. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
33. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
```

But this is way too long. Clearly, this isn't optimal. Let's try to find a shorter path.

Alternative Idea for p1's constraint: Use the fact that p1 needs to be in l2_3 once. Maybe after transporting p2 to l2_1, use a2 to carry p1 to l2_3. But airplanes can't fly to non-airports. So no.

Alternative plan for p1:

1. Load p1 into a1 at l1_1.
2. Fly to l2_1.
3. Unload p1.
4. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
5. Load p1 into t2.
6. Drive to l2_3, unload.
7. Drive back to l2_1.
8. Load into a2.
9. Fly back to l1_1.
10. Unload.
11. Load into t1 and drive to l1_3.

This is 11 steps for p1.

Combined with p2's steps:

For p2:

1. Drive t1 to l1_2, load p2, drive back to l1_1, unload.
2. Load into a1, fly to l2_1, unload.
3. Load into a2, fly back to l1_1, unload.
4. Load into t1, drive to l1_4, unload, then to l1_3.

Total steps for p2: around 14.

Combined total steps: 25. But this is still long.

But considering that constraints require certain states, maybe there's a way to overlap steps.

For example, when a1 is flying p2 to l2_1, then returning to carry p1.

Another Idea: Use a1 to carry both p1 and p2 in different trips.

But each load/unload requires the airplane to be at the location.

Alternatively, after a1 drops off p2 at l2_1, it can fly back to l1_1, pick up p1, and take it to l2_1.

Then p1 is at l2_1, can be moved to l2_3 via truck.

This way, the steps for p1 are:

1. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (after a1 returns).

2. fly to l2_1.

3. unload.

4. truck to l2_3.

5. truck back to l2_1.

6. fly back to l1_1.

7. truck to l1_3.

But how many steps?

Combined plan:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1

2. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

3. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1

4. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

5. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

6. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

7. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

8. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1

9. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

10. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

11. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

12. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2

13. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

14. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2

15. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (constraint met)

16. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

17. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

18. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

19. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

20. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

21. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

22. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

23. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1

24. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

25. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

26. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

27. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2

28. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

29. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

30. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

31. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

32. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1

33. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3

This is still 33 steps, which is clearly not optimal.

Perhaps there's a way to reuse the airplanes more efficiently.

Wait, after step7: p2 is at l2_1. We can load p2 into a2 (step16), then fly a2 to l1_1 (step17), unload p2 (step18). Then, a2 is at l1_1 and can be used to transport p1 back.

But p1 is at l2_3. So after step15 (p1 at l2_3), we need to get p1 to an airport. So drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1, load into a2, fly to l1_1.

So:

16. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

17. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

18. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

19. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

20. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

21. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

22. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

23. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1

24. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

25. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

26. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

27. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

28. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

But wait, a2 is at l1_1 after step17. So after step25, drive t2 to l2_1, unload p1 there. Then fly a2 from l1_1 to l2_1 to pick up p1.

So:

28. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1

29. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

30. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

31. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

32. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

33. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1

34. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3

This reduces some steps but still not enough.

Given the time constraints, perhaps the correct plan is as follows, but I'm not sure about the optimality:

```
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
```

But this has 25 steps and meets all constraints. However, I'm not sure if this is optimal. Given the problem's complexity and the numerous constraints, this might be the minimal steps required. The key is to ensure each constraint is met in at least one state and the implications are satisfied.
