Let's understand the problem and find a plan that meets all constraints.

First, let's clarify the objects in our world since I noticed some inconsistencies in the initial state.

Objects:
- Locations: l1_1, l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5, l2_1, l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5
- Cities: c1, c2
- Packages: p1, p2
- Trucks: t1, t2
- Airplanes: a1, a2
- Airports: l1_1 (in city c1), l2_1 (in city c2)

The initial state seems to have some errors - it lists packages t1, t2, a1, a2 which should be trucks and airplanes. Let me correct it based on what I think is intended:

Initial state:
- Location l1_1 is in city c1 (and is an airport)
- Location l1_2 is in city c1
- Location l1_3 is in city c1
- Location l1_4 is in city c1
- Location l1_5 is in city c1
- Location l2_1 is in city c2 (and is an airport)
- Location l2_2 is in city c2
- Location l2_3 is in city c2
- Location l2_4 is in city c2
- Location l2_5 is in city c2
- Truck t1 is in location l1_1
- Truck t2 is in location l2_4
- Package p1 is in location l1_1
- Package p2 is in location l1_2
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

Goal:
- Package p1 is in location l1_3
- Package p2 is in location l1_3

Constraints:
1. "Package p2 is in location l1_1" must be true at some point
2. "Package p2 is in location l1_4" must be true at some point
3. "Package p2 is in location l1_3" must be true at some point (this is part of the goal)
4. If "Package p2 is in location l1_3" is true, it must be preceded by a state where "Package p2 is in location l1_1" OR "Package p2 is in location l2_5" is true
5. "Package p2 is in a2" must be true at some point
6. "Package p2 is in location l1_2" must be true at some point (it's already true in the initial state)
7. If "Package p2 is in location l1_2" is true in some state s, then "Package p1 is in location l1_2" OR "Package p2 is in location l2_1" must be true in state s or later
8. "Package p2 is in location l1_4" OR "Package p1 is in location l2_5" must be true at some point
9. "Package p1 is in location l2_3" must be true at some point

Now let's plan to satisfy all constraints and achieve the goal.

First, let's address the interdependencies between constraints:
- Constraint 6 is already satisfied in the initial state (p2 is in l1_2)
- Constraint 7 requires that after p2 is in l1_2 (which is true initially), either p1 must be in l1_2 OR p2 must be in l2_1 at some point
- Constraint 4 requires that before p2 reaches l1_3 (the goal), it must first be in either l1_1 or l2_5

Let me sketch a high-level plan:

1. Move p2 from l1_2 to l1_1 (satisfies constraint 1)
2. Move p1 to l2_3 at some point (satisfies constraint 9)
3. Move p2 to l1_4 (satisfies constraint 2)
4. Put p2 in airplane a2 at some point (satisfies constraint 5)
5. End with both p1 and p2 in l1_3 (satisfies the goal)
6. Ensure that before p2 is in l1_3, it was in either l1_1 or l2_5 (satisfies constraint 4)
7. Ensure either p2 is in l1_4 or p1 is in l2_5 at some point (satisfies constraint 8)

Let's develop a concrete plan:

Step 1: Move p2 from l1_2 to l1_1
- drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
- loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
- drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
- unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
(This satisfies constraint 1)

Step 2: Move p1 to l2_3 (via airports l1_1 and l2_1)
- loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
- drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1 (to satisfy constraint 7 - p1 will be in l1_2)
- unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
- loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
- drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
- unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
- loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
- flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
- unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
- drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
- loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
- drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
- unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
(This satisfies constraint 9)

Step 3: Move p2 to l1_4
- loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
- drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
- unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
(This satisfies constraint 2 and part of constraint 8)

Step 4: Move p2 to a2
- loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
- drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
- unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
- loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
- flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
- unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
- loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
(This satisfies constraint 5)

Step 5: Move p1 back from l2_3 to l1_3
- loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
- drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
- unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
- loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
- flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
- unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
- loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
- drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
- unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3

Step 6: Move p2 to l1_3 (from a2)
- unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
- loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
- drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
- unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
(This completes the goal)

Let me check if all constraints are satisfied:

1. ✓ "Package p2 is in location l1_1" - Accomplished in Step 1
2. ✓ "Package p2 is in location l1_4" - Accomplished in Step 3
3. ✓ "Package p2 is in location l1_3" - Accomplished in Step 6
4. ✓ If "Package p2 is in location l1_3" is true, it must be preceded by "Package p2 is in location l1_1" or "Package p2 is in location l2_5" - We had p2 in l1_1 before it reached l1_3
5. ✓ "Package p2 is in a2" - Accomplished in Step 4
6. ✓ "Package p2 is in location l1_2" - True in the initial state
7. ✓ If "Package p2 is in location l1_2", then later "Package p1 is in location l1_2" OR "Package p2 is in location l2_1" - We had p1 in l1_2 in Step 2
8. ✓ "Package p2 is in location l1_4" OR "Package p1 is in location l2_5" - We had p2 in l1_4 in Step 3
9. ✓ "Package p1 is in location l2_3" - Accomplished in Step 2

Wait, I noticed I might have some inefficiencies in the plan. Let me revise it to make it more optimal:

Wait, I made a mistake in interpreting the problem. Let's check the initial state again. The problem states:
- "Package t1 is in location l1_1" 
- "Package t2 is in location l2_4"
- "Package a1 is in location l1_1"
- "Package a2 is in location l2_1"

But t1, t2, a1, and a2 are trucks and airplanes, not packages. Let me re-interpret the initial state correctly:

- Truck t1 is in location l1_1
- Truck t2 is in location l2_4
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1
- Package p1 is in location l1_1
- Package p2 is in location l1_2

Ok, now let's replan with the correct initial state.

Initial state:
- Location l1_1 is in city c1 (and is an airport)
- Location l1_2 is in city c1
- Location l1_3 is in city c1
- Location l1_4 is in city c1
- Location l1_5 is in city c1
- Location l2_1 is in city c2 (and is an airport)
- Location l2_2 is in city c2
- Location l2_3 is in city c2
- Location l2_4 is in city c2
- Location l2_5 is in city c2
- Truck t1 is in location l1_1
- Truck t2 is in location l2_4
- Package p1 is in location l1_1
- Package p2 is in location l1_2
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

Let me create an optimal plan that satisfies all constraints:

Step 1: Move p2 from l1_2 to l1_1
- drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
- loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
- drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
- unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
(This satisfies constraint 1)

Step 2: Move p2 to l1_4
- loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
- drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
- unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
(This satisfies constraints 2 and part of constraint 8)

Step 3: Move p1 to l1_2 (to satisfy constraint 7)
- loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
- drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1
- unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2

Step 4: Move p2 to l2_1 and into a2
- drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1
- loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
- drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
- unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
- loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
- flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
- unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
- loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
(This satisfies constraint 5)

Step 5: Move p1 to l2_3 (via airport l2_1)
- drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
- loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
- drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
- unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
- loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
- flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
- unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
- drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
- loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
- drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
- unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
(This satisfies constraint 9)

Step 6: Move both packages to l1_3
- loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
- drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
- unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
- flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
- unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
- loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
- drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
- unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
- loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
- flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
- unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
- loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
- drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
- drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
- unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
(This completes the goal and satisfies constraint 3. Constraint 4 is satisfied because p2 was in l1_1 before l1_3)

I see some inefficiency in my plan. Let me optimize it further:

Actually, I'm not sure if this plan is optimal. Let me redo it with a more careful approach to avoid unnecessary actions.

Initial state:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_1
- Truck t2 is in location l2_4
- Package p1 is in location l1_1
- Package p2 is in location l1_2
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

Let's map out our constraints and create an efficient plan:

1. ✓ "Package p2 is in location l1_1" must be true at some point
2. ✓ "Package p2 is in location l1_4" must be true at some point
3. ✓ "Package p2 is in location l1_3" must be true at the end (goal)
4. ✓ Before p2 is in l1_3, it must be in l1_1 or l2_5
5. ✓ "Package p2 is in a2" must be true at some point
6. ✓ "Package p2 is in location l1_2" is true initially
7. ✓ After p2 is in l1_2, either p1 must be in l1_2 OR p2 must be in l2_1
8. ✓ "Package p2 is in location l1_4" OR "Package p1 is in location l2_5" must be true
9. ✓ "Package p1 is in location l2_3" must be true at some point

I notice that constraint 7 gives us a choice: either move p1 to l1_2 or move p2 to l2_1. Since we need to put p2 in a2 (constraint 5), which is in l2_1 initially, it might be more efficient to move p2 to l2_1 rather than moving p1 to l1_2.

Let's create a more optimized plan:

1. First, we need to move p2 from l1_2 to l1_1 (constraint 1):
   - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
   - drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
   - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

2. Move p2 to l1_4 (constraint 2 and 8):
   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
   - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
   - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

3. For constraint 5, we need to get p2 into a2, which is in l2_1:
   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
   - drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
   - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
   - loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
   - flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
   - unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
   - loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
   (This also satisfies constraint 7 since p2 is now in l2_1)

4. For constraint 9, we need to get p1 to l2_3:
   - loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (a1 returned to l1_1 in previous step)
   - flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
   - unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
   - drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
   - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
   - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
   - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

5. Finally, get both packages to l1_3 (the goal):
   - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
   - drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
   - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
   - flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
   - unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (p2 was in a2)
   - loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
   - flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
   - unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
   - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
   - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
   - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
   - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

But there's a problem with step 5 - we can't load both packages into t1 simultaneously. Let me fix that:

5. Finally, get both packages to l1_3 (the goal):
   - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
   - drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
   - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
   - flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
   - unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (p2 was in a2)
   - loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
   - flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
   - unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
   - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
   - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
   - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
   - drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
   - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
   - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

Let me double-check that all constraints are satisfied:

1. ✓ "Package p2 is in location l1_1" - Done in step 1
2. ✓ "Package p2 is in location l1_4" - Done in step 2
3. ✓ "Package p2 is in location l1_3" - Done in step 5 (goal)
4. ✓ Before p2 is in l1_3, it was in l1_1 in step 1
5. ✓ "Package p2 is in a2" - Done in step 3
6. ✓ "Package p2 is in location l1_2" - True initially
7. ✓ After p2 is in l1_2, p2 is later in l2_1 at the end of step 3
8. ✓ "Package p2 is in location l1_4" - Done in step 2
9. ✓ "Package p1 is in location l2_3" - Done in step 4

I think I can optimize this further. Let's try a slightly different approach:

1. First, we need to move p2 from l1_2 to l1_1 (constraint 1):
   - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
   - drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
   - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

2. Move p2 to l1_4 (constraint 2 and 8):
   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
   - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
   - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

3. Now, we need p2 to go to l2_1 to enter a2 (constraint 5):
   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
   - drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
   - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
   - loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
   - flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
   - unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
   - loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
   (This satisfies constraint 7 as well, since p2 is now in l2_1)

4. Meanwhile, let's move p1 to l2_3 (constraint 9):
   - loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (a1 returned to l1_1 in step 3)
   - flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
   - unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
   - drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
   - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
   - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
   - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

5. Finally, get both packages to l1_3 (the goal) in the most efficient way:
   - flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (with p2 onboard)
   - unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
   - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
   - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
   - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
   - drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
   - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
   - loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
   - flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
   - unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
   - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
   - drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
   - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
   - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
   - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3

Wait, that last part doesn't make sense. Let me fix it:

5. Finally, get both packages to l1_3 (the goal) in the most efficient way:
   - flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (with p2 onboard)
   - unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
   - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
   - drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
   - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
   - loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
   - flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
   - unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
   - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
   - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
   - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
   - drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
   - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
   - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3

I still see inefficiency. Let me rewrite the plan one last time to make it as efficient as possible:

1. First, move p2 from l1_2 to l1_1 (constraint 1):
   - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
   - drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
   - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

2. Move p2 to l1_4 (constraint 2 and 8):
   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
   - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
   - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

3. Transfer p2 to a2 through l2_1 (constraint 5):
   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
   - drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
   - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
   - loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
   - flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
   - unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
   - loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
   (This also satisfies constraint 7 since p2 is in l2_1)

4. Move p1 to l2_3 (constraint 9):
   - flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
   - loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 
   - flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
   - unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
   - drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
   - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
   - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
   - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

5. Bring both packages to l1_3 (goal):
   - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
   - drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
   - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
   - flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (with p2 onboard)
   - unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
   - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
   - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
   - loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
   - flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
   - unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
   - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
   - drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
   - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
   - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3

Actually I'm still not satisfied with this plan. Let me try to optimize it further by considering the most efficient paths:

1. Move p2 from l1_2 to l1_1 (constraint 1):
   - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
   - drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
   - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

2. Move p2 to l1_4 (constraint 2 and 8):
   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
   - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
   - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

3. Move p1 from l1_1 to l2_3 (preparing for constraint 9):
   - loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
   - flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
   - unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
   - drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
   - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
   - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
   - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
   (This satisfies constraint 9)

4. Get p2 into a2 at l2_1 (constraint 5):
   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
   - drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
   - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
   - loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
   - flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
   - unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
   - loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
   (This also satisfies constraint 7 since p2 is in l2_1)

5. Finally, get both packages to l1_3 (goal):
   - flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (with p2 onboard)
   - unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
   - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
   - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
   - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
   - drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
   - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
   - loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
   - flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
   - unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
   - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
   - drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
   - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
   - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3

Let me fix a potential issue in the last part:

5. Finally, get both packages to l1_3 (goal):
   - flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (with p2 onboard)
   - unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
   - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
   - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
   - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
   - drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
   - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
   - loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
   - flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
   - unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
   - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
   - drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
   - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
   - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
   - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3

That's still not right in the last part. Let me fix it:

5. Finally, get both packages to l1_3 (goal):
   - flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (with p2 onboard)
   - unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
   - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
   - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3  (p2 now at goal location l1_3)
   - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
   - drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
   - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
   - loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
   - flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
   - unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
   - drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
   - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
   - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
   - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3  (p1 now at goal location l1_3)

Let's see if all constraints are satisfied:

1. ✓ "Package p2 is in location l1_1" - Done in step 1
2. ✓ "Package p2 is in location l1_4" - Done in step 2
3. ✓ "Package p2 is in location l1_3" - Done in step 5 (goal)
4. ✓ Before p2 is in l1_3, it was in l1_1 in step 1 and step 5
5. ✓ "Package p2 is in a2" - Done in step 4
6. ✓ "Package p2 is in location l1_2" - True initially
7. ✓ After p2 is in l1_2, p2 is later in l2_1 at the end of step 4
8. ✓ "Package p2 is in location l1_4" - Done in step 2
9. ✓ "Package p1 is in location l2_3" - Done in step 3

Let me put together the final plan:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
2. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
3. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
4. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
5. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
6. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
7. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
8. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
9. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
10. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
11. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
12. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
13. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
14. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
15. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
16. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
17. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
18. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
19. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
20. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
21. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
22. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
23. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
24. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
25. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
26. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
27. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
28. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
29. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
30. loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
31. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
32. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
33. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
34. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
35. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
36. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3

This plan satisfies all constraints and achieves the goal.

Let me check one more time if we can optimize this plan further:

Actually, I don't think we have to send p1 to l2_3 first. We can optimize by having p1 go directly to l1_3:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
2. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
3. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
4. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
5. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
6. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
7. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
8. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
9. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
10. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
11. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
12. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
13. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
14. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
15. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
16. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
17. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
18. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
19. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
20. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
21. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
22. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
23. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
24. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
25. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
26. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

Wait, this doesn't satisfy constraint 9 ("Package p1 is in location l2_3"). Let me go back to the original plan. The constraint that p1 must visit l2_3 is why we can't optimize further.

Final plan:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
2. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
3. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
