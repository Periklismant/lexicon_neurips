Alright, let's break down this problem and create a plan step by step.

First, I note that I need to transport package p1 to location l2_1 and package p2 to location l2_3, while making sure to follow certain constraints. The constraints essentially dictate a series of locations that each package must pass through during the course of the plan.

Let's start by understanding the initial state:
- t1 is in location l1_3 (this seems to be a typo, as t1 is a truck, not a package)
- t2 is in location l2_5 (also seems to be a typo)
- p1 is in location l2_5
- p2 is in location l1_5
- a1 is in location l1_1 (seems to be a typo, as a1 is an airplane)
- a2 is in location l2_1 (also seems to be a typo)

Let's correct the initial state as I understand it:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_3
- Truck t2 is in location l2_5
- Package p1 is in location l2_5
- Package p2 is in location l1_5
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

Now, let's go through the constraints and understand what they imply for our plan:

1. "Package p1 is in location l2_5" - this is already true in the initial state.

2. If "Package p1 is in location l2_5" holds in some state, then "Package p1 is in location l1_3" must hold at or after that state.
   - This means we need to move p1 from l2_5 to l1_3 at some point in our plan.

3. "Package p2 is in location l1_4" must hold in at least one state.
   - We need to move p2 from l1_5 to l1_4 at some point.

4. "Package p2 is in location l2_3" must hold in at least one state.
   - We need to move p2 to l2_3 at some point, which is also our goal for p2.

5. If "Package p2 is in location l2_3" holds, then earlier, either "Package p1 is in location l1_5" or "Package p1 is in location l1_4" must have been true.
   - Before moving p2 to l2_3, we must ensure p1 is in l1_5 or l1_4.

6. "At least one of the following conditions is true: "Package p2 is in a2", "Package p2 is in location l2_5"" must hold in at least one state.
   - We need to put p2 in airplane a2 or move it to location l2_5 at some point.

7. "Package p1 is in location l1_5" must hold in at least one state.
   - We need to move p1 to l1_5 at some point.

8. "Package p2 is in location l2_1" must hold in at least one state.
   - We need to move p2 to l2_1 at some point.

9. If "Package p2 is in location l2_1" holds, then earlier, either "Package p2 is in location l2_2" or "Package p1 is in location l2_4" must have been true.
   - Before moving p2 to l2_1, we must ensure p2 is in l2_2 or p1 is in l2_4.

10. "Package p2 is in a2" must hold in at least one state.
    - We need to put p2 in airplane a2 at some point.

Let's now create a plan that satisfies these constraints and reaches the goal. Let's think about the order in which we need to move the packages:

For package p1:
1. Start at l2_5. (Initial state)
2. Move to l1_5 at some point. (Constraint 7)
3. Move to l1_3 after being in l2_5. (Constraint 2)
4. End at l2_1. (Goal)

For package p2:
1. Start at l1_5. (Initial state)
2. Move to l1_4 at some point. (Constraint 3)
3. Before moving to l2_3, ensure p1 is in l1_5 or l1_4. (Constraint 5)
4. Move to l2_3 at some point. (Constraint 4 and Goal)
5. Move to l2_1 at some point, but before doing so, ensure p2 is in l2_2 or p1 is in l2_4. (Constraints 8 and 9)
6. Put p2 in a2 at some point. (Constraints 6 and 10)

Let's draft a plan:

1. First, we need to move p1 from l2_5 to l1_5 (Constraint 7):
   - We can use truck t2 to move p1 from l2_5 to l2_1 (the airport in city c2).
   - Then use airplane a2 to fly from l2_1 to l1_1 (the airport in city c1).
   - Then use truck t1 to move p1 from l1_1 to l1_5.

2. Next, we need to move p2 from l1_5 to l1_4 (Constraint 3):
   - Use truck t1 to move p2 from l1_5 to l1_4.

3. Now, p1 needs to move to l1_3 after being in l2_5 (Constraint 2):
   - Use truck t1 to move p1 from l1_5 to l1_3.

4. For p2, we need to ensure it's in a2 at some point (Constraints 6 and 10):
   - Move p2 from l1_4 to l1_1 using truck t1.
   - Load p2 into airplane a2 at l1_1.

5. Before moving p2 to l2_1, we need to ensure p2 is in l2_2 or p1 is in l2_4 (Constraint 9):
   - Fly a2 (with p2 inside) from l1_1 to l2_1.
   - Unload p2 from a2 at l2_1.
   - Use truck t2 to move p2 from l2_1 to l2_2.
   - Now, we can move p2 to l2_1 again.

6. Finally, we need to move p2 to l2_3 (Constraint 4 and Goal), but before doing so, ensure p1 is in l1_5 or l1_4 (Constraint 5):
   - Move p1 back to l1_5 or l1_4 (it's currently in l1_3).
   - Now, we can move p2 from l2_1 to l2_3.

7. Lastly, we need to move p1 to l2_1 (Goal):
   - Move p1 to l1_1 using truck t1.
   - Load p1 into airplane a1.
   - Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
   - Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1.

Let's now formalize this plan step-by-step:

Wait, I think I misunderstood something. Let's carefully read the problem again.

It says the original state is:
- "Package t1 is in location l1_3" (this is a typo, t1 is a truck)
- "Package t2 is in location l2_5" (also a typo, t2 is a truck)
- "Package p1 is in location l2_5"
- "Package p2 is in location l1_5"
- "Package a1 is in location l1_1" (typo, a1 is an airplane)
- "Package a2 is in location l2_1" (typo, a2 is an airplane)

The corrected initial state should be:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_3
- Truck t2 is in location l2_5
- Package p1 is in location l2_5
- Package p2 is in location l1_5
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

With this in mind, let's revise our plan.

I'll start by tracing the required movements for p1:
1. Start at l2_5. (Initial state)
2. Move to l1_5 at some point. (Constraint 7)
3. Move to l1_3 after being in l2_5. (Constraint 2)
4. End at l2_1. (Goal)

For package p2:
1. Start at l1_5. (Initial state)
2. Move to l1_4 at some point. (Constraint 3)
3. Before moving to l2_3, ensure p1 is in l1_5 or l1_4. (Constraint 5)
4. Put p2 in a2 at some point. (Constraints 6 and 10)
5. Move to l2_1 at some point, but before doing so, ensure p2 is in l2_2 or p1 is in l2_4. (Constraints 8 and 9)
6. End at l2_3. (Goal)

One potential order:
p1: l2_5 -> l1_5 -> l1_3 -> l2_1
p2: l1_5 -> l1_4 -> (in a2) -> l2_1 -> l2_2 -> l2_3

Let's create the step-by-step plan:

1. Move truck t2 to pick up p1:
   `drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_5 c2` (this action is redundant but I'm including it for clarity, since t2 is already at l2_5)

2. Load p1 onto truck t2:
   `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5`

3. Drive truck t2 to the airport in city c2:
   `drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2`

4. Unload p1 from truck t2 at the airport:
   `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1`

5. Load p1 onto airplane a2:
   `loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1`

6. Fly airplane a2 to the airport in city c1:
   `flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1`

7. Unload p1 from airplane a2:
   `unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1`

8. Move truck t1 to pick up p1:
   `drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1`

9. Load p1 onto truck t1:
   `loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1`

10. Drive truck t1 to l1_5:
    `drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1`

11. Unload p1 from truck t1:
    `unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5`

12. Load p2 onto truck t1:
    `loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5`

13. Drive truck t1 to l1_4:
    `drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1`

14. Unload p2 from truck t1:
    `unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4`

15. Drive truck t1 to pick up p1 again:
    `drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1`

16. Load p1 onto truck t1:
    `loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5`

17. Drive truck t1 to l1_3:
    `drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1`

18. Unload p1 from truck t1:
    `unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3`

19. Drive truck t1 to pick up p2:
    `drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1`

20. Load p2 onto truck t1:
    `loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4`

21. Drive truck t1 to the airport in city c1:
    `drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1`

22. Unload p2 from truck t1:
    `unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1`

23. Load p2 onto airplane a2:
    `loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1`

24. Fly airplane a2 back to the airport in city c2:
    `flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1`

25. Unload p2 from airplane a2:
    `unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1`

26. Load p2 onto truck t2:
    `loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1`

27. Drive truck t2 to l2_2:
    `drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2`

28. Unload p2 from truck t2:
    `unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2`

29. Load p2 onto truck t2 again:
    `loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2`

30. Drive truck t2 to l2_3:
    `drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2`

31. Unload p2 from truck t2:
    `unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3`

32. Go back to city c1 to get p1:
    `drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1`

33. Load p1 onto truck t1:
    `loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3`

34. Drive truck t1 to the airport in city c1:
    `drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1`

35. Unload p1 from truck t1:
    `unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1`

36. Load p1 onto airplane a1:
    `loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1`

37. Fly airplane a1 to the airport in city c2:
    `flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1`

38. Unload p1 from airplane a1:
    `unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1`

Now, let's check if this plan satisfies all the constraints:

1. "Package p1 is in location l2_5" - This is true in the initial state. ✓
2. If "Package p1 is in location l2_5" holds, then "Package p1 is in location l1_3" must hold at or after that state. - p1 is in l1_3 at step 18. ✓
3. "Package p2 is in location l1_4" must hold in at least one state. - p2 is in l1_4 at step 14. ✓
4. "Package p2 is in location l2_3" must hold in at least one state. - p2 is in l2_3 at the end. ✓
5. If "Package p2 is in location l2_3" holds, then earlier, either "Package p1 is in location l1_5" or "Package p1 is in location l1_4" must have been true. - p1 is in l1_5 at step 11. ✓
6. "Package p2 is in a2" or "Package p2 is in location l2_5" must hold in at least one state. - p2 is in a2 at step 23-24. ✓
7. "Package p1 is in location l1_5" must hold in at least one state. - p1 is in l1_5 at step 11. ✓
8. "Package p2 is in location l2_1" must hold in at least one state. - p2 is in l2_1 at step 25. ✓
9. If "Package p2 is in location l2_1" holds, then earlier, either "Package p2 is in location l2_2" or "Package p1 is in location l2_4" must have been true. - This constraint isn't satisfied in our current plan.
10. "Package p2 is in a2" must hold in at least one state. - p2 is in a2 at step 23-24. ✓

We're missing constraint 9. Let's revise the plan to ensure that either p2 is in l2_2 or p1 is in l2_4 before p2 is in l2_1. We can simply reorder some steps to achieve this.

Let's rewrite the plan:

1. Move truck t2 to pick up p1 (redundant, but for clarity):
   `drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_5 c2`

2. Load p1 onto truck t2:
   `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5`

3. Drive truck t2 to l2_2:

26. Drive truck t1 to the airport in city c1:
    `drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1`

27. Unload p2 from truck t1:
    `unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1`

28. Fly airplane a2 back to the airport in city c2:

30. Load p2 onto airplane a2:
    `loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1`

31. Fly airplane a2 back to the airport in city c2:

46. Load p1 onto airplane a1:
    `loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1`

47. Fly airplane a1 to the airport in city c2:
    `flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1`

48. Unload p1 from airplane a1:
    `unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1`

But wait, I made some mistakes in my plan. Let me revise it once more.

Actually I'm getting confused with all these steps. Let me rethink the problem and make a more streamlined plan. This time, let's think about the constraints from the very beginning.

The initial state is:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_3
- Truck t2 is in location l2_5
- Package p1 is in location l2_5
- Package p2 is in location l1_5
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

The goal is:
- Package p1 is in location l2_1
- Package p2 is in location l2_3

Let's think about the constraints:

1. "Package p1 is in location l2_5" - This is already true in the initial state.

2. If "Package p1 is in location l2_5" holds (which it does initially), then "Package p1 is in location l1_3" must hold at or after that state. So, at some point, p1 must be in l1_3.

3. "Package p2 is in location l1_4" must hold at some point.

4. "Package p2 is in location l2_3" must hold at some point (this is our goal for p2).

5. If "Package p2 is in location l2_3" holds, then earlier, either "Package p1 is in location l1_5" or "Package p1 is in location l1_4" must have been true. So, before p2 is in l2_3, p1 must be in either l1_5 or l1_4.

6. Either "Package p2 is in a2" or "Package p2 is in location l2_5" must hold at some point.

7. "Package p1 is in location l1_5" must hold at some point.

8. "Package p2 is in location l2_1" must hold at some point.

9. If "Package p2 is in location l2_1" holds, then earlier, either "Package p2 is in location l2_2" or "Package p1 is in location l2_4" must have been true. So, before p2 is in l2_1, either p2 must be in l2_2 or p1 must be in l2_4.

10. "Package p2 is in a2" must hold at some point.

Given these constraints, let's sketch out the paths for p1 and p2:

For p1:
Initial position: l2_5
Must visit: l1_3, l1_5
Final position: l2_1

For p2:
Initial position: l1_5
Must visit: l1_4, l2_1, l2_3, and be in a2 at some point.
Before p2 is in l2_1: either p2 must be in l2_2 or p1 must be in l2_4.
Before p2 is in l2_3: either p1 must be in l1_5 or l1_4.
Final position: l2_3

Let's create a step-by-step plan:

1. p1 is initially in l2_5.
2. Use truck t2 to move p1 from l2_5 to l2_4 (to satisfy constraint 9 which applies to p2). t2 starts at l2_5.
3. Use truck t2 to move p1 from l2_4 to l2_1.
4. Load p1 onto airplane a1.
5. Fly a1 from l2_1 to l1_1.
6. Unload p1 from a1.
7. Use truck t1 to move p1 from l1_1 to l1_5 (to satisfy constraint 7). t1 starts at l1_3.
8. Use truck t1 to move p1 from l1_5 to l1_3 (to satisfy constraint 2).
9. Use truck t1 to move p2 from l1_5 to l1_4 (to satisfy constraint 3). p2 starts at l1_5.
10. Load p2 onto a2.
11. Fly a2 from l1_1 to l2_1.
12. Unload p2 from a2. p2 is now in l2_1 (and p1 was in l2_4 earlier, satisfying constraint 9).
13. Use truck t2 to move p2 from l2_1 to l2_3. p2 is now in l2_3 (and p1 was in l1_5 earlier, satisfying constraint 5).
14. Load p1 onto a1.
15. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
16. Unload p1 from a1. p1 is now in l2_1.

I've satisfied all the constraints:
1. p1 starts in l2_5.
2. p1 is in l1_3 at some point.
3. p2 is in l1_4 at some point.
4. p2 is in l2_3 at some point.
5. Before p2 is in l2_3, p1 is in l1_5.
6. p2 is in a2 at some point.
7. p1 is in l1_5 at some point.
8. p2 is in l2_1 at some point.
9. Before p2 is in l2_1, p1 is in l2_4.
10. p2 is in a2 at some point.

Now, let's formalize this plan step-by-step:

1. `drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2`
2. `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5`
3. `drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2` (with p1 in t2)
4. `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4`
5. `drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2`
6. `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4` (redundant, as p1 should still be in t2)
7. `drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2` (with p1 in t2)
8. `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1`
9. `loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1`
10. `flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1`
11. `unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1`
12. `drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1`
13. `loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1`
14. `drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1` (with p1 in t1)
15. `unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5`
16. `loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5`
17. `drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1` (with p2 in t1)
18. `unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4`
19. `loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5` (redundant, as p1 should still be in t1)
20. `drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1` (with p1 in t1)
21. `unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3`
22. `flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1`
23. `drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1`
24. `loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4`
25. `drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1` (with p2 in t1)
26. `unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1`
27. `loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1`
28. `flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1` (with p2 in a2)
29. `unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1`
30. `drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2`
31. `loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1`
32. `drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2` (with p2 in t2)
33. `unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3`
34. `drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1`
35. `loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3`
36. `drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1` (with p1 in t1)
37. `unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1`
38. `loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1`
39. `flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1` (with p1 in a1)
40. `unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1`

But there are some logical errors in the steps I outlined. Let me revise the plan once more:

1. `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5` (Load p1 onto truck t2 at l2_5)
2. `drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2` (Drive t2 with p1 to l2_4)
3. `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4` (Unload p1 from t2 at l2_4)
4. `drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2` (Drive t2 to l2_1)
5. `flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1` (Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1)
6. `drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1` (Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1)
7. `drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1` (Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_5)
8. `loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5` (Load p2 onto t1 at l1_5)
9. `drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1` (Drive t1 with p2 to l1_4)
10. `unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4` (Unload p2 from t1 at l1_4)
11. `drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1` (Drive t1 to l1_1)
12. `loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1` (Load p2 onto a2 at l1_1)
13. `flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1` (Fly a2 with p2 to l2_1)
14. `unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1` (Unload p2 from a2 at l2_1)
15. `loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1` (Load p2 onto t2 at l2_1)
16. `drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2` (Drive t2 with p2 to l2_3)
17. `unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3` (Unload p2 from t2 at l2_3)
18. `drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2` (Drive t2 to l2_4)
19. `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4` (Load p1 onto t2 at l2_4)
20. `drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2` (Drive t2 with p1 to l2_1)
21. `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1` (Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1)

Actually, I see that there's still a issue with this revised plan. We never moved p1 to l1_5 and l1_3, which are required by constraints 2 and 7. Let me revise it once more:

I'd like to start from scratch and think more carefully about the order of operations:

Initial state:
- t1 is in l1_3
- t2 is in l2_5
- p1 is in l2_5
- p2 is in l1_5
- a1 is in l1_1
- a2 is in l2_1

1. `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5` (Load p1 onto truck t2 at l2_5)
2. `drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2` (Drive t2 with p1 to l2_4)
3. `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4` (Unload p1 from t2 at l2_4) - This helps satisfy constraint 9.
4. `drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2` (Drive t2 to l2_1)
5. `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4` (Load p1 onto t2 at l2_4)
6. `drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2` (Drive t2 with p1 to l2_1)
7. `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1` (Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1)
8. `loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1` (Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1)
9. `flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1` (Fly a2 with p1 to l1_1)
10. `unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1` (Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1)
11. `drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1` (Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1)
12. `loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1` (Load p1 onto t1 at l1_1)
13. `drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1` (Drive t1 with p1 to l1_5)
14. `unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5` (Unload p1 from t1 at l1_5) - This helps satisfy constraints 5 and 7.
15. `loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5` (Load p2 onto t1 at l1_5)
16. `drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1` (Drive t1 with p2 to l1_4)
17. `unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4` (Unload p2 from t1 at l1_4) - This helps satisfy constraint 3.
18. `loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5` (Load p1 onto t1 at l1_5)
19. `drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1` (Drive t1 with p1 to l1_3)
20. `unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3` (Unload p1 from t1 at l1_3) - This helps satisfy constraint 2.
21. `drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1` (Drive t1 to l1_4)
22. `loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4` (Load p2 onto t1 at l1_4)
23. `drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1` (Drive t1 with p2 to l1_1)
24. `unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1` (Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1)
25. `flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1` (Fly a2 from l1_1 to l2_1)
26. `loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1` (Load p2 onto a2 at l1_1)
27. `flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1` (Fly a2 with p2 to l2_1)
28. `unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1` (Unload p2 from a2 at l2_1) - This helps satisfy constraints 6, 8, and 10.
29. `loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1` (Load p2 onto t2 at l2_1)
30. `drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2` (Drive t2 with p2 to l2_3)
31. `unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3` (Unload p2 from t2 at l2_3) - This satisfies constraint 4 and part of the goal.
32. `drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1` (Drive t1 to l1_3)
33. `loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3` (Load p1 onto t1 at l1_3)
34. `drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1` (Drive t1 with p1 to l1_1)
35. `unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1` (Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1)
36. `loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1` (Load p1 onto a1 at l1_1)
37. `flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1` (Fly a1 with p1 to l2_1)
38. `unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1` (Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1) - This helps achieve part of the goal.

But I'm still making logical errors. I think I'm getting confused by the long chain of steps. Let me revise the plan once more, keeping in mind the actions, their preconditions, and the constraints. I will be more careful with the state tracking.

Actually, I'm not sure I understand the problem correctly. Let me revisit the specification. The goal is to get p1 to l2_1 and p2 to l2_3. If this is the goal, then I've made all the previous plans too complex. Let's simplify and start again.

The problem specifies several conditions, which look like they're to guide the plan, but they're not the goal.

I notice there's a typo in the original state description, it says "packages t1", "packages t2" etc., but these should be truck t1, truck t2, etc.

So the initial state is:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_3
- Truck t2 is in location l2_5
- Package p1 is in location l2_5
- Package p2 is in location l1_5
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

The goal is:
- Package p1 is in location l2_1
- Package p2 is in location l2_3

Let's come up with a simpler plan:

1. `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5` (Load p1 onto truck t2 at l2_5)
2. `drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2` (Drive t2 with p1 to l2_4) - This will help satisfy constraint 9.
3. `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4` (Unload p1 from t2 at l2_4)
4. `drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2` (Drive t2 to l2_1)
5. `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4` (Load p1 onto t2 at l2_4)
6. `drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2` (Drive t2 with p1 to l2_1)
7. `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1` (Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1) - Part of the goal.
8. `flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1` (Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1)
9. `drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1` (Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1)
10. `drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1` (Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_5)
11. `loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5` (Load p2 onto t1 at l1_5)
12. `drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1` (Drive t1 with p2 to l1_4)
13. `unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4` (Unload p2 from t1 at l1_4) - This helps satisfy constraint 3.
14. `loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4` (Load p2 onto t1 at l1_4)
15. `drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1` (Drive t1 with p2 to l1_1)
16. `unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1` (Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1)
17. `loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1` (Load p2 onto a2 at l1_1)
18. `flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1` (Fly a2 with p2 to l2_1)
19. `unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1` (Unload p2 from a2 at l2_1) - This helps satisfy constraints 6, 8, and 10.
20. `loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1` (Load p2 onto t2 at l2_1)
21. `drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2` (Drive t2 with p2 to l2_2)
22. `unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2` (Unload p2 from t2 at l2_2) - This helps satisfy constraint 9.
23. `loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2` (Load p2 onto t2 at l2_2)
24. `drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2` (Drive t2 with p2 to l2_3)
25. `unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3` (Unload p2 from t2 at l2_3) - This helps satisfy constraint 4 and part of the goal.

But constraint 5 says that before p2 is in l2_3, p1 must be in l1_5 or l1_4. And constraint 2 says p1 must be in l1_3 at some point after being in l2_5. So we need to modify the plan.

Let's adjust and try again:

1. `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5` (Load p1 onto truck t2 at l2_5)
2. `drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2` (Drive t2 with p1 to l2_4) - This will help satisfy constraint 9.
3. `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4` (Unload p1 from t2 at l2_4)
4. `drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2` (Drive t2 to l2_1)
5. `loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1` (Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1) - Actually this doesn't work, p1 is in l2_4, not l2_1.

Let me restart:

1. `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5` (Load p1 onto truck t2 at l2_5)
2. `drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2` (Drive t2 with p1 to l2_4) - This will help satisfy constraint 9.
3. `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4` (Unload p1 from t2 at l2_4)
4. `drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2` (Drive t2 to l2_1)
5. `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4` (Load p1 onto t2 at l2_4)
6. `drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2` (Drive t2 with p1 to l2_1)
7. `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1` (Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1) - One part of the goal fulfilled.
8. `loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1` (Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1)
9. `flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1` (Fly a2 with p1 to l1_1)
10. `unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1` (Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1)
11. `drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1` (Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1)
12. `loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1` (Load p1 onto t1 at l1_1)
13. `drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1` (Drive t1 with p1 to l1_5)
14. `unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5` (Unload p1 from t1 at l1_5) - This helps satisfy constraints 5 and 7.
15. `loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5` (Load p2 onto t1 at l1_5)
16. `drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1` (Drive t1 with p2 to l1_4)
17. `unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4` (Unload p2 from t1 at l1_4) - This helps satisfy constraint 3.
18. `loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5` (Load p1 onto t1 at l1_5)
19. `drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1` (Drive t1 with p1 to l1_3)
20. `unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3` (Unload p1 from t1 at l1_3) - This helps satisfy constraint 2.
21. `drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1` (Drive t1 to l1_4)
22. `loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4` (Load p2 onto t1 at l1_4)
23. `drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1` (Drive t1 with p2 to l1_1)
24. `unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1` (Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1)
25. `loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1` (Load p2 onto a2 at l1_1)
26. `flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1` (Fly a2 with p2 to l2_1)
27. `unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1` (Unload p2 from a2 at l2_1) - This helps satisfy constraints 6, 8, and 10.
28. `loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1` (Load p2 onto t2 at l2_1)
29. `drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2` (Drive t2 with p2 to l2_2)
30. `unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2` (Unload p2 from t2 at l2_2) - This helps satisfy constraint 9.
31. `loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2` (Load p2 onto t2 at l2_2)
32. `drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2` (Drive t2 with p2 to l2_3)
33. `unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3` (Unload p2 from t2 at l2_3) - This helps satisfy constraint 4 and part of the goal.
34. `flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1` (Fly a2 back to l1_1)
35. `loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1` (Load p1 onto a2 at l1_1)
36. `flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1` (Fly a2 with p1 to l2_1)
37. `unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1` (Unload p1 from a2 at l2_1) - Both parts of the goal fulfilled.

Actually, I realize the plan is getting a bit complex because the constraints are leading us in a circle. Let's check the constraints and ensure we're following them:

1. "Package p1 is in location l2_5" - Satisfied in initial state. ✓
2. If "Package p1 is in location l2_5" holds, then "Package p1 is in location l1_3" must hold at or after that. - p1 is in l1_3 at step 20. ✓
3. "Package p2 is in location l1_4" must hold. - p2 is in l1_4 at step 17. ✓
4. "Package p2 is in location l2_3" must hold. - p2 is in l2_3 at step 33. ✓
5. If "Package p2 is in location l2_3" holds, then earlier, either "Package p1 is in location l1_5" or "Package p1 is in location l1_4" must have been true. - p1 is in l1_5 at step 14. ✓
6. "Package p2 is in a2" or "Package p2 is in location l2_5" must hold. - p2 is in a2 at steps 25-26. ✓
7. "Package p1 is in location l1_5" must hold. - p1 is in l1_5 at step 14. ✓
8. "Package p2 is in location l2_1" must hold. - p2 is in l2_1 at step 27. ✓
9. If "Package p2 is in location l2_1" holds, then earlier, either "Package p2 is in location l2_2" or "Package p1 is in location l2_4" must have been true. - p1 is in l2_4 at step 3. ✓
10. "Package p2 is in a2" must hold. - p2 is in a2 at steps 25-26. ✓

All constraints are satisfied in this plan! However, the plan has issue, I've tried to load p1 onto t1 at step 18 when it's at l1_5, but we unloaded p1 from t1 at l1_5 at step 14 and then immediately loaded p2 onto t1 at step 15. So p1 doesn't exist at l1_5 at step 18.

Let me revise it one last time:

1. `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5` (Load p1 onto truck t2 at l2_5)
2. `drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2` (Drive t2 with p1 to l2_4) - This will help satisfy constraint 9.
3. `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4` (Unload p1 from t2 at l2_4)
4. `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4` (Load p1 onto t2 at l2_4)
5. `drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2` (Drive t2 with p1 to l2_1)
6. `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1` (Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1) - One part of the goal fulfilled.
7. `loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1` (Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1)
8. `flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1` (Fly a2 with p1 to l1_1)
9. `unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1` (Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1)
10. `drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1` (Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1)
11. `loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1` (Load p1 onto t1 at l1_1)
12. `drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1` (Drive t1 with p1 to l1_5)
13. `unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5` (Unload p1 from t1 at l1_5) - This helps satisfy constraints 5 and 7.
14. `drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1` (Drive t1 to l1_3)
15. `drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_5 c1` (Drive t1 to l1_5)
16. `loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5` (Load p2 onto t1 at l1_5)
17. `drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1` (Drive t1 with p2 to l1_4)
18. `unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4` (Unload p2 from t1 at l1_4) - This helps satisfy constraint 3.
19. `drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1` (Drive t1 to l1_5)
20. `loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5` (Load p1 onto t1 at l1_5)
21. `drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1` (Drive t1 with p1 to l1_3)
22. `unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3` (Unload p1 from t1 at l1_3) - This helps satisfy constraint 2.
23. `drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1` (Drive t1 to l1_4)
24. `loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4` (Load p2 onto t1 at l1_4)
25. `drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1` (Drive t1 with p2 to l1_1)
26. `unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1` (Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1)
27. `loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1` (Load p2 onto a2 at l1_1)
28. `flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1` (Fly a2 with p2 to l2_1)
29. `unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1` (Unload p2 from a2 at l2_1) - This helps satisfy constraints 6, 8, and 10.
30. `loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1` (Load p2 onto t2 at l2_1)
31. `drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2` (Drive t2 with p2 to l2_2)
32. `unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2` (Unload p2 from t2 at l2_2) - This helps satisfy constraint 9.
33. `loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2` (Load p2 onto t2 at l2_2)
34. `drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2` (Drive t2 with p2 to l2_3)
35. `unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3` (Unload p2 from t2 at l2_3) - This helps satisfy constraint 4 and part of the goal.
36. `flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1` (Fly a2 back to l1_1)
37. `drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1` (Drive t1 to l1_3)
38. `loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3` (Load p1 onto t1 at l1_3)
39. `drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1` (Drive t1 with p1 to l1_1)
40. `unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1` (Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1)
41. `loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1` (Load p1 onto a2 at l1_1)
42. `flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1` (Fly a2 with p1 to l2_1)
43. `unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1` (Unload p1 from a2 at l2_1) - Both parts of the goal satisfied.

I think this plan is correct and satisfies all the constraints. It's a bit long, but it does the job.

Actually, while reviewing it once more, I see that I've overlooked a much simpler plan:

1. p1 is already in l2_5, which satisfies constraint 1.
2. We can move p1 from l2_5 to l2_4 to help satisfy constraint 9.
3. We can then move p1 to l1_5 to satisfy constraint 7.
4. We can then move p1 to l1_3 to satisfy constraint 2.
5. Then, move p2 from its initial position l1_5 to l1_4 to satisfy constraint 3.
6. Load p2 onto airplane a2 to satisfy constraint 10.
7. Move p2 to l2_1 to satisfy constraint 8.
8. Move p2 to l2_3 to satisfy constraint 4 and part of the goal.
9. Move p1 back to l2_1 to satisfy the other part of the goal.

Let's formalize this plan:

1. `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5` (Load p1 onto truck t2 at l2_5)
2. `drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2` (Drive t2 with p1 to l2_4) - This will help satisfy constraint 9.

4. `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4` (Load p1 onto t2 at l2_4)
5. `drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2` (Drive t2 with p1 to l2_1)
6. `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1` (Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1)
7. `loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1` (Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1)
8. `flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1` (Fly a2 with p1 to l1_1)
9. `unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1` (Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1)
10. `drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1` (Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1)
11. `loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1` (Load p1 onto t1 at l1_1)
12. `drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1` (Drive t1 with p1 to l1_5)
13. `unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5` (Unload p1 from t1 at l1_5) - This helps satisfy constraints 5 and 7.
14. `loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5` (Load p2 onto t1 at l1_5)
15. `drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1` (Drive t1 with p2 to l1_4)
16. `unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4` (Unload p2 from t1 at l1_4) - This helps satisfy constraint 3.
17. `loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5` (Load p1 onto t1 at l1_5) - I realize that I made a mistake; p1 is already at l1_5 at this point.
18. `drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1` (Drive t1 to l1_5)
19. `loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5` (Load p1 onto t1 at l1_5)
20. `drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1` (Drive t1 with p1 to l1_3)
21. `unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3` (Unload p1 from t1 at l1_3) - This helps satisfy constraint 2.
22. `drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1` (Drive t1 to l1_4)
23. `loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4` (Load p2 onto t1 at l1_4)
24. `drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1` (Drive t1 with p2 to l1_1)
25. `unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1` (Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1)
26. `loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1` (Load p2 onto a2 at l1_1)
27. `flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1` (Fly a2 with p2 to l2_1)
28. `unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1` (Unload p2 from a2 at l2_1) - This helps satisfy constraints 6, 8, and 10.

38. `flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1` (Fly a2 with p1 to l2_1)
39. `unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1` (Unload p1 from a2 at l2_1) - Both parts of the goal satisfied.

This seems right. However, I see two issues: (1) at step 17, I load p1 at l1_5, but p1 is at l1_5 at step 13 and cannot be at two places at once. (2) At step 18, I send t1 from l1_4 to l1_5, but t1 is already at l1_4 from step 15.

Let me revise this plan one more time, to ensure it's correct:

Initial state:
- t1 is in l1_3
- t2 is in l2_5
- p1 is in l2_5
- p2 is in l1_5
- a1 is in l1_1
- a2 is in l2_1

1. `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5` (Load p1 onto truck t2 at l2_5)
2. `drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2` (Drive t2 with p1 to l2_4) - This will help satisfy constraint 9.
3. `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4` (Unload p1 from t2 at l2_4)
4. `drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_5 c1` (Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_5)
5. `loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5` (Load p2 onto t1 at l1_5)
6. `drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1` (Drive t1 with p2 to l1_4)
7. `unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4` (Unload p2 from t1 at l1_4) - This helps satisfy constraint 3.
8. `drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1` (Drive t1 to l1_1)
9. `flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1` (Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1)
10. `loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1` (Load p2 onto a2 at l1_1)
11. `flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1` (Fly a2 with p2 to l2_1)
12. `unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1` (Unload p2 from a2 at l2_1) - This helps satisfy constraints 6, 8, and 10.
13. `loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1` (Load p2 onto t2 at l2_1)
14. `drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2` (Drive t2 with p2 to l2_4)
15. `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4` (Load p1 onto t2 at l2_4)
16. `drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2` (Drive t2 with p1 to l2_1)
17. `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1` (Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1) - One part of the goal fulfilled.
18. `drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2` (Drive t2 with p2 to l2_3) - But p2 is not in t2 at this point. Oops.

I need to be more careful about where packages are. Let me go back to the previous approach, and this time I'll be very explicit about where each object is at each step.

Let me start from scratch:

Initial state:
- t1 is in l1_3
- t2 is in l2_5
- p1 is in l2_5
- p2 is in l1_5
- a1 is in l1_1
- a2 is in l2_1

Let me think through this step by step, keeping track of the location of each object:

1. `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5` - p1 is now in t2, t2 is in l2_5.
2. `drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2` - p1 is in t2, t2 is now in l2_4.
3. `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4` - p1 is now in l2_4, t2 is in l2_4.
4. `drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2` - p1 is in l2_4, t2 is now in l2_1.
5. `drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_5 c1` - p1 is in l2_4, p2 is in l1_5, t1 is now in l1_5, t2 is in l2_1.
6. `loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5` - p1 is in l2_4, p2 is now in t1, t1 is in l1_5, t2 is in l2_1.
7. `drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1` - p1 is in l2_4, p2 is in t1, t1 is now in l1_4, t2 is in l2_1.
8. `unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4` - p1 is in l2_4, p2 is now in l1_4, t1 is in l1_4, t2 is in l2_1.
9. `drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2` - p1 is in l2_4, p2 is in l1_4, t1 is in l1_4, t2 is now in l2_4.
10. `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4` - p1 is now in t2, p2 is in l1_4, t1 is in l1_4, t2 is in l2_4.
11. `drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2` - p1 is in t2, p2 is in l1_4, t1 is in l1_4, t2 is now in l2_1.
12. `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1` - p1 is now in l2_1, p2 is in l1_4, t1 is in l1_4, t2 is in l2_1. This partially achieves our goal!
13. `loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1` - p1 is now in a2, p2 is in l1_4, t1 is in l1_4, t2 is in l2_1, a2 is in l2_1.
14. `flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1` - p1 is in a2, p2 is in l1_4, t1 is in l1_4, t2 is in l2_1, a2 is now in l1_1.
15. `unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1` - p1 is now in l1_1, p2 is in l1_4, t1 is in l1_4, t2 is in l2_1, a2 is in l1_1.
16. `drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1` - p1 is in l1_1, p2 is in l1_4, t1 is now in l1_1, t2 is in l2_1, a2 is in l1_1.
17. `loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1` - p1 is now in t1, p2 is in l1_4, t1 is in l1_1, t2 is in l2_1, a2 is in l1_1.
18. `drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1` - p1 is in t1, p2 is in l1_4, t1 is now in l1_5, t2 is in l2_1, a2 is in l1_1.
19. `unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5` - p1 is now in l1_5, p2 is in l1_4, t1 is in l1_5, t2 is in l2_1, a2 is in l1_1. This satisfies constraint 7 and helps with 5.
20. `drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1` - p1 is in l1_5, p2 is in l1_4, t1 is now in l1_3, t2 is in l2_1, a2 is in l1_1.
21. `drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_5 c1` - p1 is in l1_5, p2 is in l1_4, t1 is now in l1_5, t2 is in l2_1, a2 is in l1_1.
22. `loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5` - p1 is now in t1, p2 is in l1_4, t1 is in l1_5, t2 is in l2_1, a2 is in
