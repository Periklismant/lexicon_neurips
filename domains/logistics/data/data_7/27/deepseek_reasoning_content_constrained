Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. Hmm, the goal is to get p1 to l2_1 and p2 to l1_3. Also, there are a bunch of constraints to satisfy. Let me first understand the initial state and the constraints step by step.

Starting with the initial state:

- p1 and p2 are both in l2_4, which is in city c2. The airports are l1_1 (c1) and l2_1 (c2). Trucks t1 is in l1_3 (c1), t2 in l2_1 (c2). Airplanes a1 is in l1_1, a2 in l2_1.

So, p1 and p2 are in c2, need to get p1 to l2_1 (which is an airport in c2) and p2 to l1_3 in c1. Wait, but how? Since trucks can only move within their city, and airplanes between airports. So maybe we need to fly p2 from c2 to c1 via airplane, then use a truck in c1 to get it to l1_3. Similarly, p1 needs to go to l2_1, which is in its current city (c2), so maybe just move it via truck. But let's check the constraints.

Constraints:

1. At least once, p1 is in l1_1. So p1 has to be in the airport of c1 at some point. But p1 starts in c2. So maybe we need to fly p1 to c1's airport l1_1, but then why? Because the goal is for p1 to be in l2_1 (c2's airport). Wait, that seems conflicting. Unless we have to move p1 from c2 to c1 and then back? But the goal is l2_1. Hmm. Wait, maybe the constraint is that at some point p1 is in l1_1, but the final goal is l2_1. So we have to route p1 through l1_1 even though it's not needed for the goal. That's tricky.

2. At least once, p2 is in l2_1. Since the goal is p2 in l1_3, which is in c1. So p2 starts in c2. To get to c1, it needs to be flown from l2_1 (airport of c2) to l1_1 (airport of c1). So maybe p2 must pass through l2_1 (the airport) when being loaded onto an airplane. Wait, but the initial position of p2 is l2_4. So to get it to l2_1, we need to drive a truck in c2 (t2 is in l2_1). Wait, t2 is in l2_1. So we can load p2 into t2 at l2_4, but wait, t2 is in l2_1. So we need to drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4, load p2, then drive back to l2_1, unload, then fly to c1.

But also, constraint 3 says that if p2 is in l2_1 at any state, then either p2 was in l2_4 or l1_4 at that state or after. Wait, but if p2 is being moved to l2_1, then after unloading, it's in l2_1, so the condition would require that either before or after that state, p2 is in l2_4 or l1_4. Well, since p2 starts in l2_4, that's already satisfied. So maybe that constraint is automatically met. Wait, the constraint says that if in some state s, p2 is in l2_1, then either in s or in a state after s, at least one of the conditions (p2 in l2_4 or l1_4) must hold. But if we move p2 from l2_4 to l2_1, then in the initial state, p2 is in l2_4. But after moving to l2_1, p2 is no longer in l2_4. So the constraint would require that after moving to l2_1, p2 must be in l2_4 or l1_4 again. Wait, but that would complicate things. Because once p2 is in l2_1, we need to have it in l2_4 or l1_4 again at some point after. But the goal is to get p2 to l1_3. So maybe when moving p2 to l1_3, we have to pass through l1_4? Or maybe this constraint is satisfied by the initial state where p2 is in l2_4, but then when p2 is moved to l2_1, the condition is that either at s (the state where p2 is in l2_1) or after, it is in l2_4 or l1_4. But after moving to l2_1, p2 is loaded onto an airplane and flown to l1_1, then maybe to l1_4 via truck. So perhaps after l2_1, p2 goes to l1_4, satisfying the constraint.

Constraint 4: At least once, p1 is in l1_5 or p2 is in a1. So we need to have either of these. Let's see. If we can get p2 into a1 (the airplane in l1_1), that would satisfy this. Maybe during the transportation of p2, we can load it into a1, which is in l1_1. But a1 is in l1_1, so if p2 is unloaded at l1_1 into a1, that would work.

Constraint 5: At least once, p2 is in l1_1. So p2 must be in the airport of c1. That's part of the path if we fly p2 from l2_1 to l1_1.

Constraint 6: If p2 is in l1_1 in some state, there must be an earlier state where p1 is in l1_4. So before p2 arrives at l1_1, p1 must have been in l1_4 at some point. So we need to get p1 to l1_4 first. But p1 starts in l2_4 (c2), so how does it get to l1_4? That's in c1. So to get p1 to c1, we need to fly it via airplane. But p1's goal is in l2_1 (c2). So perhaps p1 is moved to c1, then back to c2. But that seems complicated. Let's think: maybe p1 is first moved to l2_1 (airport) via truck in c2, then flown to l1_1 (c1's airport), then driven to l1_4, then back to c2. But that seems time-consuming. But given the constraints, we have to do this.

Constraint 7: At least once, p1 is in t1. t1 is in l1_3 (c1). So p1 has to be loaded into t1. Which would require p1 to be in l1_3, and t1 is already there. So perhaps when p1 is moved to l1_3, we load it into t1, then unload it again. But why? Because the goal is for p1 to be in l2_1. Wait, this is conflicting. Unless p1 is being moved through c1. So, maybe p1 is flown to l1_1, then driven to l1_3 (using t1), loaded into t1 (satisfying constraint 7), then perhaps driven elsewhere.

Constraint 8: At least once, p2 is in l1_3. That's the goal, so that's covered.

Constraint 9: If p2 is in l1_3 in some state, then there must be an earlier state where either p1 is in l1_3 or p2 is in l2_3. So before p2 gets to l1_3, either p1 was there or p2 was in l2_3. Since p2 starts in l2_4, maybe we have to move p2 to l2_3 first. But how? l2_3 is in c2. So using truck t2, drive from l2_1 (where t2 is) to l2_4, load p2, drive to l2_3, unload. Then drive back to l2_1, load into airplane, etc. But that adds steps, but maybe necessary.

Constraint 10: At least once, p1 is in l1_3. So p1 has to be there. Which is also part of constraint 7 (if p1 is in t1, and t1 is in l1_3, then p1 must be in l1_3 when unloaded). So maybe after flying p1 to l1_1, drive it to l1_3, unload, then load into t1 (which is in l1_3), satisfying both constraints 7 and 10.

Putting this all together, the plan needs to handle both packages, satisfy all constraints, and reach the goals.

Let's outline the steps for p2 first:

p2 starts in l2_4 (c2). To get to l1_3 (c1):

1. Move p2 from l2_4 to l2_1 (airport of c2) via truck t2. So drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4, load p2, drive back to l2_1. Then load into airplane a2 (which is at l2_1), fly to l1_1. Then unload p2 from a2 at l1_1. Then, since l1_1 is in c1, use truck t1 (which is in l1_3) to drive to l1_1, load p2, drive to l1_3, unload. But wait, t1 is in l1_3. So drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1, load p2, then drive back to l1_3 and unload. That would get p2 to l1_3, satisfying the goal.

But constraints:

- p2 must be in l2_1 (which happens when loaded into airplane at l2_1).
- When p2 is in l2_1, the constraint requires that either in that state or after, p2 is in l2_4 or l1_4. Since p2 was in l2_4 before, but after being moved to l2_1, it's no longer there. So to satisfy this, after p2 is in l2_1 (when loaded into the airplane), it is flown to l1_1, then perhaps moved to l1_4. So after unloading at l1_1, drive t1 to l1_4, unload p2 there, then load again and drive to l1_3. That way, after l2_1, p2 is in l1_4, satisfying the constraint.

Also, constraint 5 requires p2 to be in l1_1. Which would happen when it's unloaded from the airplane there.

For p1:

p1 starts in l2_4 (c2). Goal is l2_1 (c2's airport). So maybe move via truck. But constraints require p1 to be in l1_1, l1_3, and t1. Also, constraint 6 says that if p2 is in l1_1, then p1 was in l1_4 earlier. So the plan must have p1 in l1_4 before p2 arrives in l1_1.

So perhaps p1's path is:

From l2_4 (c2) to l2_1 via truck t2 (same as p2?), then flown to l1_1, then driven to l1_4 (using truck in c1, t1?), then back to l1_3, loaded into t1 (satisfying constraint 7 and 10), then flown back to c2's airport l2_1. But this seems very involved. Let's see:

p1 is in l2_4. To reach l2_1, can we use truck t2? t2 is in l2_1. So drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4, load p1, drive back to l2_1. Then unload. That would get p1 to l2_1, which is the goal. But this doesn't satisfy the constraint that p1 must be in l1_1. So we need to take p1 to l1_1 somehow.

But the goal for p1 is l2_1. So the only way to satisfy the constraint that p1 is in l1_1 is to move it there, then move it back. Which complicates the plan.

So for p1:

1. Move p1 from l2_4 to l2_1 (via t2), then load into airplane a2 (which is at l2_1), fly to l1_1. Unload p1 at l1_1 (satisfying constraint 1). Then, to get it back to l2_1, fly again. But that requires loading into a1 (which is at l1_1) and flying to l2_1. But a2 is in l2_1 after the flight. Wait, initial positions: a1 is in l1_1, a2 in l2_1. So if we fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1 (carrying p1), then a2 is now in l1_1. To get p1 back to l2_1, we need to use a1? Because a1 is in l1_1. So load p1 into a1, fly to l2_1. Then unload. But that's two flights for p1. 

But also, during this, p1 would be in l1_1, l1_4 (if moved there), and l1_3. Let's see.

So steps for p1:

- Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4 (load p1 and p2?), but maybe separate steps.

Wait, initial state: p1 and p2 are both in l2_4. So t2 is in l2_1. So drive t2 to l2_4, load both p1 and p2 into t2, drive back to l2_1. Then unload both. Then load p1 into a2, fly to l1_1. Unload p1. Then drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1, load p1, drive to l1_4 (satisfying the need for p1 to be in l1_4 before p2 arrives in l1_1). Then unload p1 at l1_4. Then, to get p1 back to l2_1, maybe drive t1 back to l1_1, load p1 into a1, fly to l2_1, unload. But this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, after p1 is in l1_1 (from a2), we can drive it to l1_4 using t1. Then, that satisfies constraint 6 (when p2 arrives at l1_1, p1 was in l1_4 earlier). Then, move p1 back to l1_1, fly back to l2_1. But this requires multiple steps.

Also, the constraint 7 requires p1 to be in t1. So when p1 is loaded into t1 (in l1_3?), maybe when moving from l1_1 to l1_4, t1 is used. Wait, t1 is in l1_3 initially. So drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1, load p1, drive to l1_4 (unload), then drive back to l1_3. Wait, but then p1 is in l1_4. To get it back to c2, need to fly. So after p1 is in l1_4, drive t1 to l1_4, load p1, drive to l1_1, unload, load into a1, fly to l2_1. Then unload. That would get p1 to l2_1.

But this is a lot of steps. Let's try to outline this:

For p1:

1. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4 (c2).
2. Load p1 into t2 at l2_4.
3. Drive t2 back to l2_1.
4. Unload p1 at l2_1.
5. Load p1 into a2 (airplane at l2_1).
6. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1 (c1's airport).
7. Unload p1 at l1_1. (This satisfies constraint 1: p1 in l1_1.)
8. Now, drive t1 (in l1_3) to l1_1.
9. Load p1 into t1 at l1_1. (This satisfies constraint 7: p1 in t1.)
10. Drive t1 to l1_4.
11. Unload p1 at l1_4. (This will be the state where p1 is in l1_4, which is needed before p2 arrives in l1_1.)
12. Then, drive t1 back to l1_1 (or maybe proceed differently).
13. Load p1 into a1 (which is at l1_1).
14. Fly a1 to l2_1.
15. Unload p1 at l2_1. (Goal achieved.)

For p2:

1. After p1 is moved to l1_4, we can handle p2.

But let's interleave the steps. Let's think about the order of operations.

First, handle p1's movement to l1_4 to satisfy constraint 6 for p2's arrival in l1_1.

But p2's arrival in l1_1 is after flying from l2_1. So steps for p2:

Initial steps (p2 in l2_4):

1. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4 (same as for p1).
2. Load p2 into t2.
3. Drive t2 back to l2_1.
4. Unload p2 at l2_1. (This satisfies constraint 2: p2 in l2_1.)
   - Now, constraint 3: since p2 is in l2_1, after this state, p2 needs to be in l2_4 or l1_4. But p2 is being moved to l1_1 next, so perhaps after flying to l1_1, it's driven to l1_4, satisfying the constraint.
5. Load p2 into a2 (which is at l2_1).
6. Fly a2 to l1_1. (After this, a2 is in l1_1.)
7. Unload p2 at l1_1. (Satisfies constraint 5: p2 in l1_1.)
   - Now, constraint 6: if p2 is in l1_1, there must be an earlier state where p1 was in l1_4. So p1 must have been in l1_4 before this. So steps 1-11 for p1 (up to unloading p1 in l1_4) must happen before step 7 for p2.
8. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1 (if not already there). But earlier steps for p1 might have t1 in l1_4.
   Wait, after step 11 for p1, t1 is in l1_4 (after unloading p1 there). So to move p2 from l1_1 to l1_3, we need t1 to be available. So:

8. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1.
9. Load p2 into t1 at l1_1.
10. Drive t1 to l1_3.
11. Unload p2 at l1_3. (Goal achieved.)

But also, constraint 9: when p2 is in l1_3, there must be an earlier state where p1 is in l1_3 or p2 is in l2_3. So during p1's journey, p1 is in l1_3 (from step 10: when unloaded in l1_3? Wait, p1 was loaded into t1 in l1_1 (step 9), driven to l1_4 (step 10), unloaded (step 11). Then t1 is driven back to l1_1 (step 8 for p2), but p1 is in l1_4. So p1 was in l1_3 only when loaded into t1. Wait, t1 is in l1_3 initially. When we load p1 into t1 at l1_1 (step 9 for p1), that requires t1 to be in l1_1. So to load p1 into t1, we have to drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1 first. So step 8 for p1: drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1. Then load p1 into t1 (step 9), then drive to l1_4 (step 10). So during this, p1 is in t1, which is in l1_1, then l1_4. So p1 is not in l1_3, except when t1 is there initially. So maybe when t1 is driven from l1_3 to l1_1, p1 is loaded there. So p1 is in l1_1, then l1_4. To satisfy constraint 9 (for p2 in l1_3), we need either p1 in l1_3 earlier or p2 in l2_3 earlier. Since p2 starts in l2_4, maybe we need to move p2 to l2_3 before flying. So during the initial steps for p2:

After step 3 (unload p2 at l2_1), before loading into airplane, drive t2 to l2_3, unload p2 there, then drive back? But that would add steps. But constraint 9 requires that before p2 is in l1_3, either p1 was in l1_3 or p2 was in l2_3. So if p2 is in l2_3 at any point, that would satisfy it. So perhaps:

After unloading p2 at l2_1 (step 4 for p2), drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_3, load p2, drive back to l2_1. Then load into airplane. But this adds steps. Alternatively, during the initial movement of p2 from l2_4 to l2_1, take a detour to l2_3. For example:

1. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4.
2. Load p2 into t2.
3. Drive t2 to l2_3 (instead of back to l2_1 immediately).
4. Unload p2 at l2_3 (satisfying part of constraint 9).
5. Load p2 again into t2.
6. Drive t2 to l2_1.
7. Unload p2.

This way, p2 was in l2_3, satisfying the condition. Then proceed to fly to l1_1. Then when p2 is in l1_3, the earlier state where p2 was in l2_3 exists, satisfying constraint 9.

But this adds steps. Let's see if that's necessary.

If we don't do this, then when p2 is unloaded at l1_3 (final step), we need to have had p1 in l1_3 earlier. But p1 is in l1_3 only if it's unloaded there. Wait, during p1's steps, when is it in l1_3? Only if after being flown to l1_1, driven to l1_3. But in our earlier plan, p1 is driven from l1_1 to l1_4, not l1_3. So perhaps we need to adjust the plan so that p1 is in l1_3 at some point.

Alternatively, adjust p2's path to go through l2_3. Let's try that.

So for p2:

1. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4.
2. Load p2 into t2.
3. Drive t2 to l2_3. (Since l2_3 is in c2, drivetruck is allowed.)
4. Unload p2 at l2_3. (Now, constraint 9 is satisfied because p2 was in l2_3.)
5. Load p2 into t2 again.
6. Drive t2 to l2_1.
7. Unload p2 at l2_1.
8. Load into a2, fly to l1_1.
9. Unload p2, then drive to l1_3 via t1.

This adds steps but ensures constraint 9 is met.

Now, let's check all constraints:

- Constraint 1: p1 in l1_1 (when p1 is flown there).
- Constraint 2: p2 in l2_1 (when unloaded after truck).
- Constraint 3: When p2 is in l2_1, after that, it's flown to l1_1, then to l1_4 (maybe) which would satisfy the "l1_4" part.
- Constraint 4: Either p1 in l1_5 or p2 in a1. If p2 is loaded into a1 at some point, that would work. But in the current plan, p2 is loaded into a2. So maybe we need to transfer p2 into a1. For example, after flying to l1_1 with a2, unload p2, then load into a1 (which is at l1_1), then unload again. But why? To satisfy constraint 4. Alternatively, have p1 in l1_5. So during p1's movement, drive t1 to l1_5 and unload. But l1_5 is in c1. So maybe after step 11 (p1 in l1_4), drive t1 to l1_5, unload p1, then load again and drive back. But that's extra steps. Alternatively, maybe during the initial steps for p1, drive t1 to l1_5. But that's not necessary unless required.

Alternatively, after p2 is unloaded at l1_1 (step 9), load it into a1 (which is at l1_1). Then unload again. That would put p2 in a1, satisfying constraint 4. Then, unload from a1 and proceed. So:

9. Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1.
10. Load p2 into a1 (at l1_1). (Now p2 is in a1, satisfying constraint 4.)
11. Unload p2 from a1 at l1_1.
12. Then drive t1 to l1_1, load p2, drive to l1_3, unload.

But this adds steps. But it's necessary to satisfy constraint 4.

Constraint 5: p2 in l1_1 (achieved when unloaded from a2 or a1 there).

Constraint 6: If p2 is in l1_1, then p1 was in l1_4 earlier. So in our plan, p1 is moved to l1_4 before p2 arrives in l1_1. So that's okay.

Constraint 7: p1 in t1 (achieved when loaded into t1 at l1_1).

Constraint 8: p2 in l1_3 (final step).

Constraint 9: Satisfied by p2 being in l2_3 earlier.

Constraint 10: p1 in l1_3. But in our current plan, p1 is in l1_4 and l1_1. So to satisfy this, maybe we need to move p1 to l1_3. For example, after p1 is in l1_4, drive t1 to l1_3, unload p1 there. But then p1 would be in l1_3, satisfying constraint 10. Then, to get p1 back to l2_1, we'd have to fly again.

But p1's goal is l2_1. So after being in l1_3, how does p1 get back? Let's adjust the plan:

After step 11 for p1 (unload at l1_4), drive t1 to l1_3 (with p1 still in t1?), no. Wait, p1 was unloaded at l1_4. So to get p1 to l1_3, we'd need to load it into t1 again at l1_4, then drive to l1_3 and unload. That would satisfy constraint 10. So:

11. Unload p1 at l1_4.
12. Load p1 into t1 at l1_4.
13. Drive t1 to l1_3.
14. Unload p1 at l1_3. (Now, constraint 10 is satisfied.)
15. Then drive t1 to l1_1.
16. Load p1 into a1.
17. Fly a1 to l2_1.
18. Unload p1 at l2_1. (Goal achieved.)

This adds steps but satisfies all constraints.

Now, compiling all these steps, ensuring the order is correct and all preconditions are met.

Let's outline the full plan step by step, making sure that actions are possible given their preconditions.

For p1 and p2, some steps can be done in parallel where possible, but since actions are sequential, need to order them properly.

First, handle moving t2 to l2_4 to pick up both packages.

1. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2. (Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4.)
   - Precondition: t2 is in l2_1, which it is initially.
   - Effect: t2 is now in l2_4.
2. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4. (Load p1 into t2 at l2_4.)
   - Pre: p1 and t2 are in l2_4.
3. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4. (Load p2 into t2 at l2_4.)
   - Pre: p2 and t2 are in l2_4.
4. Drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2. (Drive to l2_3 for constraint 9.)
   - Pre: t2 is in l2_4, l2_3 is in c2.
5. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3. (Unload p2 at l2_3 to satisfy constraint 9.)
6. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3. (Reload p2 into t2.)
7. Drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2. (Drive back to l2_1.)
8. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1. (Unload p1.)
9. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1. (Unload p2.)

Now, p1 and p2 are in l2_1. Next, fly p1 to l1_1 and handle p2's journey.

10. Loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1. (Load p1 into a2.)
11. Flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1. (Fly to l1_1.)
12. Unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1. (p1 is now in l1_1, satisfying constraint 1.)

Now, move p1 to l1_4 via t1.

13. Drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1. (Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1.)
14. Loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1. (Load p1 into t1, satisfying constraint 7.)
15. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1. (Drive to l1_4.)
16. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4. (Now p1 is in l1_4, which is needed for constraint 6.)

Now, handle p2's journey to l1_1 and beyond.

17. Loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1. (Load p2 into a2.)
    - Wait, a2 is now in l1_1 after step 11. Oh no! Because after flying a2 to l1_1, it's there. So in step 17, a2 is in l1_1, not l2_1. So we can't load p2 into a2 at l2_1 anymore. This is a problem.

Ah, right. After step 11, a2 is in l1_1. So we need to use a different airplane for p2. The other airplane is a1, which is in l1_1. But to fly p2 from l2_1 to l1_1, we need an airplane in l2_1. But a2 is now in l1_1, and a1 is in l1_1. So there's no airplane in l2_1 to carry p2. This is a mistake in the plan.

This means that after step 11, a2 is in l1_1, and we can't use it to transport p2 from l2_1. Therefore, we need to adjust the plan. Perhaps use a different airplane for p1 and p2.

Wait, the initial airplanes are a1 in l1_1 and a2 in l2_1. So for p1, we used a2 to fly from l2_1 to l1_1. Then a2 is stuck in l1_1. For p2, we need to use a1. But a1 is in l1_1. So unless we fly a1 to l2_1 first, which requires moving it. But that would take steps.

Alternative approach: Fly p1 using a1 instead of a2. But a1 is in l1_1 initially. To get p1 to l1_1, we need to fly from l2_1. But a1 isn't there. So we need to bring a1 to l2_1 first. But that's complicated.

Alternative plan: After moving p1 to l2_1 via truck, use a2 to fly p1 to l1_1. Then, after a2 is in l1_1, fly a2 back to l2_1 empty to transport p2. But that would require flying a2 back.

So steps after step 12 (p1 unloaded at l1_1):

13. Flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1. (Fly empty back to l2_1 to pick up p2.)
14. Loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1. (Now a2 is back in l2_1.)
15. Flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1. (Fly p2 to l1_1.)
16. Unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1. (Now p2 is in l1_1, satisfying constraint 5.)

Then proceed to move p2 to l1_3.

But this adds steps. Let's adjust the plan accordingly.

Revised steps for p1 and p2:

1. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2.
2. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4.
3. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4.
4. Drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2.
5. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3. (Satisfy constraint 9.)
6. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3.
7. Drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2.
8. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1.
9. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.

Now, p1 and p2 are in l2_1.

10. Loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1.
11. Flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.
12. Unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1. (Constraint 1 met.)

Now, a2 is in l1_1. Need to get it back to l2_1 to carry p2.

13. Flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1. (Fly empty back.)
14. Loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1.
15. Flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.
16. Unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1. (Constraint 5 met.)

Now, move p1 to l1_4 via t1.

17. Drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1.
18. Loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1. (Constraint 7 met.)
19. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1.
20. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4. (Now p1 is in l1_4, needed for constraint 6.)

Now, p2 is in l1_1. Before that, p1 was in l1_4 (step 20 before step 16? No, step 16 is after 20? Let's check the order. Wait, step 16 is unloading p2 in l1_1. To satisfy constraint 6, p1 must be in l1_4 before p2 is in l1_1. So step 20 (p1 in l1_4) must come before step 16 (p2 in l1_1). But how? Because to fly p2 to l1_1, we need to have a2 back in l2_1. Let's adjust the order.

After step 12 (p1 in l1_1), process p1 first:

13. Drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1.
14. Loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1. (Constraint 7.)
15. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1.
16. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4. (Now p1 is in l1_4.)

Then, fly a2 back to l2_1 to get p2.

17. Flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1.
18. Loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1.
19. Flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.
20. Unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1. (Now p2 is in l1_1, and p1 was in l1_4 earlier, satisfying constraint 6.)

Now, move p2 to l1_3.

21. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1. (Assuming t1 is in l1_4 after step 16.)
22. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.
23. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1.
24. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3. (Goal for p2 met.)

Now, need to get p1 back to l2_1.

But p1 is in l1_4. So:

25. Drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1. (Drive to l1_4.)
26. Loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4.
27. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1.
28. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1.
29. Loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1. (a1 is in l1_1.)
30. Flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1.
31. Unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1. (Goal for p1 met.)

Also, check constraint 4: At least once, p1 is in l1_5 or p2 is in a1. In step 29, p1 is loaded into a1. So when it's in a1 (during step 29 and 30), that satisfies "p2 is in a1"? No, p1 is in a1. So that doesn't help. Wait, constraint 4 says "Package p1 is in l1_5 or Package p2 is in a1". So we need either p1 in l1_5 or p2 in a1. In our plan, p2 is in a2, not a1. So we need to get p1 into l1_5 or p2 into a1.

To satisfy constraint 4, we can add a step where p2 is loaded into a1. For example:

After step 20 (p2 in l1_1), load p2 into a1, then unload.

21. Loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1. (Now p2 is in a1, satisfying constraint 4.)
22. Unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1.
23. Then proceed to drive p2 to l1_3.

This adds steps but satisfies constraint 4.

So adjusting the plan:

After step 20:

21. Loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1. (p2 is in a1.)
22. Unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1. (Now p2 is back in l1_1.)
23. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1. (t1 is in l1_4 after step 16.)
24. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.
25. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1.
26. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3. (Goal met.)

Then, handling p1's return to l2_1:

27. Drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1. (To pick up p1.)
28. Loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4.
29. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1.
30. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1.
31. Loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1.
32. Flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1.
33. Unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1. (Goal met.)

Now, all constraints should be met.

Check constraint 4: p2 was in a1 (step 21), so it's satisfied.

Constraint 10: p1 was in l1_3. Wait, when? In the current plan, p1 is moved from l1_4 to l1_1, but not to l1_3. So we need to ensure that p1 is in l1_3 at least once. According to constraint 10: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "Package p1 is in location l1_3"". So we need to have p1 in l1_3.

But in the current plan, p1 is in l1_4 and l1_1, but not l1_3. So we need to adjust.

How to get p1 to l1_3:

After step 16 (p1 in l1_4), maybe drive t1 to l1_3 and unload p1 there.

So:

17. After step 16 (unload p1 in l1_4), drive t1 to l1_3.

Wait, step 16 is unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4. Then:

17. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1. (Drive to l1_3.)
18. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3. (Now p1 is in l1_3, satisfying constraint 10.)
19. Loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3. (Reload to move back.)
20. Drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1. (To fly back.)

But this adds steps. But it's necessary for constraint 10.

So integrating this into the plan:

After step 16 (unload p1 in l1_4):

17. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1.
18. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3. (Satisfy constraint 10.)
19. Loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3. (To continue moving.)
20. Drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1.
21. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1.
22. Loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1.
23. Flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1.
24. Unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1.

But this complicates the plan further. However, it's necessary to meet constraint 10.

Now, compiling all the steps:

For p1 and p2:

1. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2.
2. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4.
3. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4.
4. Drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2.
5. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3.
6. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3.
7. Drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2.
8. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1.
9. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.
10. Loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1.
11. Flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.
12. Unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1.
13. Drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1.
14. Loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1.
15. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1.
16. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4.
17. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1.
18. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3. (Constraint 10 met.)
19. Loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3.
20. Drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1.
21. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1.
22. Flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1. (Fly a2 back to l2_1.)
23. Loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1.
24. Flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.
25. Unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1.
26. Loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1. (To satisfy constraint 4.)
27. Unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1.
28. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1. (Assuming t1 is in l1_1 after step 21.)
29. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.
30. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1.
31. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3. (Goal met.)
32. Loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1. (Assuming p1 is in l1_1 after step 21.)
33. Flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1.
34. Unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1. (Goal met.)

But this is a very long plan. Let's check for any possible optimizations or redundancies.

For example, steps 26 and 27 (loading and unloading p2 into a1) could be merged if possible. Also, after step 25, p2 is in l1_1. Loading into a1 and unloading immediately doesn't change the location but satisfies constraint 4.

Similarly, steps 17-20 are moving p1 to l1_3 and back, which might be necessary for constraint 10.

This seems to cover all constraints. Now, let's verify each constraint:

1. p1 in l1_1: step 12.
2. p2 in l2_1: step 9.
3. When p2 is in l2_1 (step 9), after that, p2 is flown to l1_1 (steps 23-25), then to l1_4 via truck? No, but in the plan, after p2 is in l1_1, it's moved to l1_3. However, constraint 3 says if p2 is in l2_1, then in that state or after, p2 must be in l2_4 or l1_4. In the initial state, p2 was in l2_4, but after step 9, p2 is in l2_1. The constraint requires that after that, p2 must be in l2_4 or l1_4. But in the plan, after step 9, p2 is moved to l1_1 (step 25), then to l1_3. So this does not satisfy the constraint unless l1_4 is visited. So perhaps we need to route p2 through l1_4 after l1_1.

So, after step 25 (p2 in l1_1), instead of directly moving to l1_3, drive to l1_4 first:

Adjust steps after step 25:

25. Unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1.
26. Loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1. (Step 26-27 for constraint 4.)
27. Unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1.
28. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1. (Drive to l1_4.)
29. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4. (Now p2 is in l1_4.)
30. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4.
31. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1.
32. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3. (Goal met.)

This way, after p2 is in l2_1 (step 9), it moves to l1_4 (step 29), satisfying constraint 3.

Also, this adds steps but ensures compliance.

With this adjustment, the constraint 3 is satisfied.

Now, integrating this into the plan:

After step 25 (p2 in l1_1):

26. Loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1. (Step 26)
27. Unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1. (Step 27, p2 in l1_1)
28. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1. (t1 is in l1_1 after step 21.)
29. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1. (Load p2 into t1 at l1_1)
30. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1.
31. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4. (Now p2 is in l1_4, satisfying constraint 3 after being in l2_1.)
32. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4.
33. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1.
34. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3. (Goal met.)

But this adds even more steps. However, it's necessary to meet constraint 3.

At this point, the plan is quite long, but all constraints are being addressed. It's possible that a more optimal path exists, but given the complexity of the constraints, this may be the minimal plan.

Finally, after ensuring all steps are correctly ordered and preconditions are met, here's the final plan:
