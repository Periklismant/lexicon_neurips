I need to carefully analyze this problem to develop a valid plan. Let me first understand the constraints and requirements properly.

Let's start by summarizing the initial state and goals:

Initial state:
- Locations l1_1 through l1_5 are in city c1
- Locations l2_1 through l2_5 are in city c2
- t1 is in location l1_3 (this seems to be a truck, not a package as stated)
- t2 is in location l2_1 (this seems to be a truck)
- p1 is in location l2_4 (package)
- p2 is in location l2_4 (package)
- a1 is in location l1_1 (this seems to be an airplane)
- a2 is in location l2_1 (this seems to be an airplane)
- l1_1 and l2_1 are airports

Goal state:
- p1 is in location l2_1
- p2 is in location l1_3

Constraints:
1. p1 must visit l1_1 at some point
2. p2 must visit l2_1 at some point
3. After p2 is in l2_1, it must later be in either l2_4 or l1_4
4. Either p1 must be in l1_5 or p2 must be in a1 at some point
5. p2 must visit l1_1 at some point
6. Before p2 is in l1_1, p1 must be in l1_4
7. p1 must be in t1 at some point
8. p2 must be in l1_3 at some point
9. Before p2 is in l1_3, either p1 must be in l1_3 or p2 must be in l2_3
10. p1 must be in l1_3 at some point

I notice there are several constraints that force certain packages to visit certain locations. I need to make sure all these constraints are satisfied in my plan.

There seems to be some inconsistency in the initial state where trucks and airplanes are described as packages. I'll interpret this as:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_3
- Truck t2 is in location l2_1
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

Let me think through a plan step by step:

1. First, I need to get p1 from l2_4 to l2_1 (final goal)
2. I also need to get p2 from l2_4 to l1_3 (final goal)
3. During this process, I need to satisfy all the constraints

Let's try to organize these constraints into a sequence that would make sense:

- p1 must be in l1_3 (constraint 10)
- p1 must be in t1 (constraint 7)
- p1 must be in l1_4 (constraint 6)
- p2 must be in l2_1 (constraint 2)
- p2 must be in either l2_4 or l1_4 after being in l2_1 (constraint 3)
- p1 must be in l1_1 (constraint 1)
- p2 must be in l1_1 (constraint 5)
- Either p1 must be in l1_5 or p2 must be in a1 (constraint 4)
- Either p1 must be in l1_3 or p2 must be in l2_3 (constraint 9)
- p2 must be in l1_3 (constraint 8)

I'll create a plan that satisfies all these constraints and achieves the goal. First, let me outline a high-level plan:

Starting with:
- Package p1 in l2_4
- Package p2 in l2_4
- Truck t1 in l1_3
- Truck t2 in l2_1
- Airplane a1 in l1_1
- Airplane a2 in l2_1

Let's create a step-by-step plan:

1. First, move t2 to l2_4 to pick up both packages
2. Load p1 into t2
3. Load p2 into t2
4. Drive t2 to l2_3 (satisfying part of constraint 9)
5. Drive t2 to airport l2_1
6. Unload p2 from t2 (satisfying constraint 2)
7. Load p2 into a2
8. Fly a2 to l1_1
9. Unload p2 from a2 (satisfying constraint 5)
10. Unload p1 from t2
11. Load p1 into a2
12. Fly a2 to l2_1
13. Unload p1 from a2 (satisfying constraint 1 and final goal for p1)
14. Load p2 into a1
15. Fly a1 to l2_1
16. Unload p2 from a1
17. Load p2 into t2
18. Drive t2 to l2_4 (satisfying constraint 3)
19. Unload p2 from t2
20. Load p2 into t2
21. Drive t2 to l2_1
22. Unload p2 from t2
23. Load p2 into a2
24. Fly a2 to l1_1
25. Unload p2 from a2
26. Load p2 into a1 (satisfying constraint 4)
27. Fly a1 to l1_1
28. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_4
29. Fly a1 to l1_1
30. Unload p2 from a1
31. Load p2 into t1
32. Drive t1 to l1_3
33. Unload p2 from t1 (final goal for p2)

Wait, this plan doesn't seem to satisfy all the constraints, and I think I'm making the problem more complicated than it needs to be. Let me reconsider the plan.

Let's look at the initial locations again:
- Package p1 in l2_4
- Package p2 in l2_4
- Truck t1 in l1_3
- Truck t2 in l2_1
- Airplane a1 in l1_1
- Airplane a2 in l2_1

And check the constraints again:
1. p1 must visit l1_1 at some point
2. p2 must visit l2_1 at some point
3. After p2 is in l2_1, it must later be in either l2_4 or l1_4
4. Either p1 must be in l1_5 or p2 must be in a1 at some point
5. p2 must visit l1_1 at some point
6. Before p2 is in l1_1, p1 must be in l1_4
7. p1 must be in t1 at some point
8. p2 must be in l1_3 at some point
9. Before p2 is in l1_3, either p1 must be in l1_3 or p2 must be in l2_3
10. p1 must be in l1_3 at some point

And our goals are:
- p1 in l2_1
- p2 in l1_3

I think I need to start again with a more systematic approach:

First, for p1:
- p1 starts in l2_4
- p1 needs to be in t1 at some point (constraint 7)
- p1 needs to be in l1_3 at some point (constraint 10)
- p1 needs to be in l1_4 before p2 is in l1_1 (constraint 6)
- p1 needs to be in l1_1 at some point (constraint 1)
- p1 needs to end in l2_1

For p2:
- p2 starts in l2_4
- p2 needs to be in l2_1 at some point (constraint 2)
- After p2 is in l2_1, it needs to be in either l2_4 or l1_4 (constraint 3)
- p2 needs to be in l1_1 at some point, but after p1 is in l1_4 (constraint 5 and 6)
- p2 needs to be in l1_3, but after either p1 is in l1_3 or p2 is in l2_3 (constraint 8 and 9)
- Either p1 needs to be in l1_5 or p2 needs to be in a1 (constraint 4)

Given these constraints, let me try to construct a plan again:

1. Drive truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_4
2. Load package p1 into truck t2 at l2_4
3. Load package p2 into truck t2 at l2_4
4. Drive truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_3 (this satisfies part of constraint 9)
5. Drive truck t2 from l2_3 to l2_1 (this satisfies constraint 2 for p2)
6. Unload package p2 from truck t2 at l2_1
7. Drive truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_4
8. Unload package p1 from truck t2 at l2_4
9. Load package p2 into truck t2 at l2_1
10. Drive truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_4 (this satisfies constraint 3)
11. Unload package p2 from truck t2 at l2_4
12. Load package p1 into truck t2 at l2_4
13. Drive truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_1
14. Unload package p1 from truck t2 at l2_1
15. Load package p1 into airplane a2 at l2_1
16. Load package p2 into truck t2 at l2_4
17. Drive truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_1
18. Unload package p2 from truck t2 at l2_1
19. Load package p2 into airplane a2 at l2_1
20. Fly airplane a2 from l2_1 to l1_1 (this satisfies constraint 1 for p1 and constraint 5 for p2)
21. Unload package p1 from airplane a2 at l1_1
22. Unload package p2 from airplane a2 at l1_1
23. Load package p1 into truck t1 at l1_3
24. Drive truck t1 from l1_3 to l1_4 (this satisfies constraint 6 for p1)
25. Unload package p1 from truck t1 at l1_4
26. Load package p2 into airplane a1 at l1_1 (this satisfies constraint 4)
27. Fly airplane a1 from l1_1 to l1_1 (just to ensure p2 is in a1)
28. Unload package p2 from airplane a1 at l1_1
29. Load package p1 into truck t1 at l1_4 (this satisfies constraint 7)
30. Drive truck t1 from l1_4 to l1_3 (this satisfies constraint 10 for p1)
31. Unload package p1 from truck t1 at l1_3
32. Load package p2 into truck t1 at l1_1
33. Drive truck t1 from l1_1 to l1_3 (this satisfies constraint 8 and constraint 9 since p1 is already in l1_3)
34. Unload package p2 from truck t1 at l1_3
35. Load package p1 into truck t1 at l1_3
36. Drive truck t1 from l1_3 to l1_1
37. Unload package p1 from truck t1 at l1_1
38. Load package p1 into airplane a2 at l1_1
39. Fly airplane a2 from l1_1 to l2_1
40. Unload package p1 from airplane a2 at l2_1

This seems to satisfy all constraints and achieve the goal state. Let me double-check:

1. p1 must visit l1_1 at some point: Satisfied in step 21
2. p2 must visit l2_1 at some point: Satisfied in step 6
3. After p2 is in l2_1, it must later be in either l2_4 or l1_4: Satisfied in step 11
4. Either p1 must be in l1_5 or p2 must be in a1 at some point: Satisfied in step 26
5. p2 must visit l1_1 at some point: Satisfied in step 22
6. Before p2 is in l1_1, p1 must be in l1_4: Satisfied in step 24-25
7. p1 must be in t1 at some point: Satisfied in step 29
8. p2 must be in l1_3 at some point: Satisfied in step 34
9. Before p2 is in l1_3, either p1 must be in l1_3 or p2 must be in l2_3: Satisfied in step 4 and 31
10. p1 must be in l1_3 at some point: Satisfied in step 31

Goals:
- p1 in l2_1: Satisfied in step 40
- p2 in l1_3: Satisfied in step 34

Let me check the plan again to see if all actions are valid according to the preconditions:

Wait, I notice a mistake in my plan. In step 20, I'm trying to fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1, but I've loaded both p1 and p2 into a2 without moving them to l2_1 first. Let me fix this and other potential issues:

1. Drive truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_4
2. Load package p1 into truck t2 at l2_4
3. Load package p2 into truck t2 at l2_4
4. Drive truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_3 (this satisfies part of constraint 9)
5. Drive truck t2 from l2_3 to l2_1 (this satisfies constraint 2 for p2)
6. Unload package p2 from truck t2 at l2_1
7. Drive truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_4
8. Load package p2 into truck t2 at l2_1 (this doesn't make sense as p2 is now in l2_1, not l2_4)

I'm getting confused with the plan. Let me start again more carefully, tracking the locations of each object throughout the plan:

Initial state:
- p1 in l2_4
- p2 in l2_4
- t1 in l1_3
- t2 in l2_1
- a1 in l1_1
- a2 in l2_1

1. Drive truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_4
   - Now t2 is in l2_4
2. Load package p1 into truck t2 at l2_4
   - Now p1 is in t2
3. Load package p2 into truck t2 at l2_4
   - Now p2 is in t2
4. Drive truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_3
   - Now t2 is in l2_3
   - This satisfies part of constraint 9
5. Drive truck t2 from l2_3 to l2_1
   - Now t2 is in l2_1
6. Unload package p2 from truck t2 at l2_1
   - Now p2 is in l2_1
   - This satisfies constraint 2
7. Drive truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_4
   - Now t2 is in l2_4
8. Load package p2 into truck t2 at l2_1 (This is invalid as t2 is now in l2_4)

I'm making errors in tracking the locations. Let me try again with a clearer approach:

Initial state:
- p1 in l2_4
- p2 in l2_4
- t1 in l1_3
- t2 in l2_1
- a1 in l1_1
- a2 in l2_1

Let me try to construct a plan that achieves the constraints one by one:

1. Drive truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_4
   - t2 is now in l2_4
2. Load package p1 into truck t2 at l2_4
   - p1 is now in t2
3. Load package p2 into truck t2 at l2_4
   - p2 is now in t2
4. Drive truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_3
   - t2 (with p1 and p2) is now in l2_3
   - This satisfies part of constraint 9 (p2 in l2_3)
5. Drive truck t2 from l2_3 to l2_1
   - t2 (with p1 and p2) is now in l2_1
6. Unload package p2 from truck t2 at l2_1
   - p2 is now in l2_1
   - This satisfies constraint 2 (p2 in l2_1)
7. Load package p2 into truck t2 at l2_1
   - p2 is now in t2
8. Drive truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_4
   - t2 (with p1 and p2) is now in l2_4
9. Unload package p2 from truck t2 at l2_4
   - p2 is now in l2_4
   - This satisfies constraint 3 (p2 in l2_4 after being in l2_1)
10. Drive truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_1
    - t2 (with p1) is now in l2_1
11. Load package p2 into truck t2 at l2_4 (This is invalid as t2 is now in l2_1)

Let me try to plan this more systematically. I'll ensure each step is valid based on the current state of the world.

Initial state:
- p1 in l2_4
- p2 in l2_4
- t1 in l1_3
- t2 in l2_1
- a1 in l1_1
- a2 in l2_1

1. Drive truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_4
   - t2 is now in l2_4
2. Load package p1 into truck t2 at l2_4
   - p1 is now in t2
3. Load package p2 into truck t2 at l2_4
   - p2 is now in t2
4. Drive truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_3
   - t2 (with p1 and p2) is now in l2_3
   - This satisfies part of constraint 9 (p2 is in l2_3)
5. Drive truck t2 from l2_3 to l2_1
   - t2 (with p1 and p2) is now in l2_1
6. Unload package p2 from truck t2 at l2_1
   - p2 is now in l2_1
   - This satisfies constraint 2 (p2 is in l2_1)
7. Drive truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_4
   - t2 (with p1) is now in l2_4
8. Unload package p1 from truck t2 at l2_4
   - p1 is now in l2_4
9. Load package p1 into truck t2 at l2_4
   - p1 is now in t2
10. Drive truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_1
    - t2 (with p1) is now in l2_1
11. Load package p2 into airplane a2 at l2_1
    - p2 is now in a2
12. Unload package p1 from truck t2 at l2_1
    - p1 is now in l2_1
    - This achieves the goal for p1
13. Fly airplane a2 from l2_1 to l1_1
    - a2 (with p2) is now in l1_1
14. Drive truck t1 from l1_3 to l1_4
    - t1 is now in l1_4
15. Load package p1 into airplane a2 at l2_1 (This is invalid as p1 is in l2_1 but a2 is in l1_1)

I'm still making errors in tracking. Let me try a different approach. I'll keep a clear track of the locations of each object.

Initial state:
- p1 in l2_4
- p2 in l2_4
- t1 in l1_3
- t2 in l2_1
- a1 in l1_1
- a2 in l2_1

Let's develop a systematic plan:

1. Move t2 to l2_4 to pick up p1 and p2
2. Move t2 with p1 and p2 to l2_3 (satisfying part of constraint 9)
3. Move t2 with p1 and p2 to l2_1 (satisfying constraint 2 for p2)
4. Drop p1 at l2_1 (achieving goal for p1)
5. Move t2 with p2 to l2_4 (satisfying constraint 3)
6. Drop p2 at l2_4
7. Move t2 to pick up p2 from l2_4
8. Move t2 with p2 to l2_1
9. Drop p2 at l2_1
10. Load p2 into a2
11. Fly a2 with p2 to l1_1 (satisfying constraint 5)
12. Drop p2 at l1_1
13. Load p2 into a1 (satisfying constraint 4)
14. Unload p2 from a1
15. Load p1 into a2 at l2_1
16. Fly a2 with p1 to l1_1 (satisfying constraint 1)
17. Unload p1 from a2
18. Load p1 into t1 (satisfying constraint 7)
19. Move t1 with p1 to l1_4 (satisfying constraint 6)
20. Move t1 with p1 to l1_3 (satisfying constraint 10)
21. Unload p1 from t1
22. Load p2 into t1
23. Move t1 with p2 to l1_3
24. Unload p2 from t1 (achieving goal for p2)

But I think I'm still violating the constraints. Let me verify:

1. p1 must visit l1_1: Satisfied in step 17
2. p2 must visit l2_1: Satisfied in step 3
3. After p2 is in l2_1, it must later be in either l2_4 or l1_4: Satisfied in step 6
4. Either p1 must be in l1_5 or p2 must be in a1: Satisfied in step 13
5. p2 must visit l1_1: Satisfied in step 12
6. Before p2 is in l1_1, p1 must be in l1_4: Not satisfied as p1 only gets to l1_4 in step 19, after p2 is already in l1_1
7. p1 must be in t1: Satisfied in step 18
8. p2 must be in l1_3: Satisfied in step 24
9. Before p2 is in l1_3, either p1 must be in l1_3 or p2 must be in l2_3: Satisfied in step 2 and 21
10. p1 must be in l1_3: Satisfied in step 21

So there's an issue with constraint 6. I need to ensure p1 is in l1_4 before p2 is in l1_1. Let me revise the plan.

Initial state:
- p1 in l2_4
- p2 in l2_4
- t1 in l1_3
- t2 in l2_1
- a1 in l1_1
- a2 in l2_1

Revised plan:

1. Drive truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_4
   - t2 is now in l2_4
2. Load package p1 into truck t2 at l2_4
   - p1 is now in t2
3. Load package p2 into truck t2 at l2_4
   - p2 is now in t2
4. Drive truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_3
   - t2 (with p1 and p2) is now in l2_3
   - This satisfies part of constraint 9 (p2 is in l2_3)
5. Drive truck t2 from l2_3 to l2_1
   - t2 (with p1 and p2) is now in l2_1
6. Unload package p1 from truck t2 at l2_1
   - p1 is now in l2_1
7. Unload package p2 from truck t2 at l2_1
   - p2 is now in l2_1
   - This satisfies constraint 2 (p2 is in l2_1)
8. Load package p1 into airplane a2 at l2_1
   - p1 is now in a2
9. Fly airplane a2 from l2_1 to l1_1
   - a2 (with p1) is now in l1_1
   - This satisfies constraint 1 (p1 is in l1_1)
10. Unload package p1 from airplane a2 at l1_1
    - p1 is now in l1_1
11. Load package p1 into truck t1 at l1_3 (This is invalid as p1 is in l1_1)

Let me try again, making sure each step is valid:

Initial state:
- p1 in l2_4
- p2 in l2_4
- t1 in l1_3
- t2 in l2_1
- a1 in l1_1
- a2 in l2_1

1. Drive truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_4
   - t2 is now in l2_4
2. Load package p1 into truck t2 at l2_4
   - p1 is now in t2
3. Drive truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_3
   - t2 (with p1) is now in l2_3
4. Drive truck t2 from l2_3 to l2_1
   - t2 (with p1) is now in l2_1
5. Unload package p1 from truck t2 at l2_1
   - p1 is now in l2_1
6. Load package p1 into airplane a2 at l2_1
   - p1 is now in a2
7. Drive truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_4
   - t2 is now in l2_4
8. Load package p2 into truck t2 at l2_4
   - p2 is now in t2
9. Drive truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_3
   - t2 (with p2) is now in l2_3
   - This satisfies part of constraint 9 (p2 is in l2_3)
10. Drive truck t2 from l2_3 to l2_1
    - t2 (with p2) is now in l2_1
11. Unload package p2 from truck t2 at l2_1
    - p2 is now in l2_1
    - This satisfies constraint 2 (p2 is in l2_1)
12. Fly airplane a2 from l2_1 to l1_1
    - a2 (with p1) is now in l1_1
    - This satisfies constraint 1 (p1 is in l1_1)
13. Unload package p1 from airplane a2 at l1_1
    - p1 is now in l1_1
14. Load package p1 into truck t1 at l1_1
    - This is invalid as t1 is in l1_3, not l1_1

I'm still making errors in tracking. Let me try a different approach:

Let's first focus on planning the first part of the solution - getting p1 where it needs to be:

Initial state:
- p1 in l2_4
- p2 in l2_4
- t1 in l1_3
- t2 in l2_1
- a1 in l1_1
- a2 in l2_1

1. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4
2. Load p1 into t2 at l2_4
3. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1
4. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1
5. Load p1 into a2 at l2_1
6. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1 (satisfying constraint 1 - p1 in l1_1)
7. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1
8. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1
9. Load p1 into t1 at l1_1 (satisfying constraint 7 - p1 in t1)
10. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_4 (satisfying constraint 6 - p1 in l1_4)
11. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_3 (satisfying constraint 10 - p1 in l1_3)
12. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_3
13. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1

Now for p2:

14. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4
15. Load p2 into t2 at l2_4
16. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_3
17. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1 (satisfying constraint 2 - p2 in l2_1)
18. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1
19. Load p2 into t2 at l2_1
20. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4
21. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_4 (satisfying constraint 3 - p2 in l2_4 after being in l2_1)
22. Load p2 into t2 at l2_4
23. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1
24. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1
25. Load p2 into a2 at l2_1
26. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1 (satisfying constraint 5 - p2 in l1_1)
27. Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1
28. Load p2 into a1 at l1_1 (satisfying constraint 4 - p2 in a1)
29. Unload p2 from a1 at l1_1
30. Load p2 into t1 at l1_1
31. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_3 (satisfying constraint 8 - p2 in l1_3)
32. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_3

But wait, I realize I'm still not satisfying all the constraints properly:
- Constraint 9 says before p2 is in l1_3, either p1 must be in l1_3 or p2 must be in l2_3.
- In my plan, p1 is in l1_3 at step 11-12, but then we move it, and p2 doesn't arrive in l1_3 until step 31.

Let me revise the plan to ensure this constraint is met:

1. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4
2. Load p1 into t2 at l2_4
3. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1
4. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1
5. Load p1 into a2 at l2_1
6. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1 (satisfying constraint 1 - p1 in l1_1)
7. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1
8. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1
9. Load p1 into t1 at l1_1 (satisfying constraint 7 - p1 in t1)
10. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_4 (satisfying constraint 6 - p1 in l1_4)
11. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_3 (satisfying constraint 10 - p1 in l1_3)
12. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_3
   - **At this point, p1 is in l1_3, satisfying part of constraint 9**
13. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4
14. Load p2 into t2 at l2_4
15. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_3
16. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1 (satisfying constraint 2 - p2 in l2_1)
17. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1
18. Load p2 into t2 at l2_1
19. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4
20. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_4 (satisfying constraint 3 - p2 in l2_4 after being in l2_1)
21. Load p2 into t2 at l2_4
22. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1
23. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1
24. Load p2 into a2 at l2_1
25. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1 (satisfying constraint 5 - p2 in l1_1)
26. Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1
27. Load p2 into a1 at l1_1 (satisfying constraint 4 - p2 in a1)
28. Unload p2 from a1 at l1_1
29. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1
30. Load p2 into t1 at l1_1
31. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_3 (satisfying constraint 8 - p2 in l1_3)
32. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_3
33. Load p1 into t1 at l1_3
34. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l2_1
35. Unload p1 from t1 at l2_1

But this doesn't work either, as t1 can't drive from l1_3 to l2_1 directly (it's a city-to-city move).

Let me try to create a plan that satisfies all constraints correctly:

1. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4
2. Load p1 into t2 at l2_4
3. Load p2 into t2 at l2_4
4. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_3 (satisfying part of constraint 9 - p2 in l2_3)
5. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1
6. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1 (satisfying constraint 2 - p2 in l2_1)
7. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1
8. Load p1 into a2 at l2_1
9. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1 (satisfying constraint 1 - p1 in l1_1)
10. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1
11. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1
12. Load p1 into t1 at l1_1 (satisfying constraint 7 - p1 in t1)
13. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_4 (satisfying constraint 6 - p1 in l1_4)
14. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4
15. Load p2 into t2 at l2_1 (invalid as p2 is in l2_1 but t2 has moved to l2_4)

I need to be more careful with my plan. Let me revise:

1. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4
2. Load p1 into t2 at l2_4
3. Load p2 into t2 at l2_4
4. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_3 (satisfying part of constraint 9 - p2 in l2_3)
5. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1
6. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1 (satisfying constraint 2 - p2 in l2_1)
7. Load p2 into a2 at l2_1
8. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1
9. Unload p2 from a2 at l2_1 (invalid as we immediately unload p2 after loading it)

Let me simplify and try again:

Initial state:
- p1 in l2_4
- p2 in l2_4
- t1 in l1_3
- t2 in l2_1
- a1 in l1_1
- a2 in l2_1

1. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4
2. Load p1 into t2 at l2_4
3. Load p2 into t2 at l2_4
4. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_3 (satisfying part of constraint 9 - p2 in l2_3)
5. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1
6. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1 (satisfying constraint 2 - p2 in l2_1)
7. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4
8. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1 (invalid as t2 has moved to l2_4)

I think I need to be even more careful with tracking the state of the world after each action. Let me try a different approach:

Initial state:
- p1 in l2_4
- p2 in l2_4
- t1 in l1_3
- t2 in l2_1
- a1 in l1_1
- a2 in l2_1

Let's construct a plan that satisfies the constraints:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
   - t2 is now in l2_4
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
   - p1 is now in t2
3. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
   - p2 is now in t2
4. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2
   - t2 (with p1, p2) is now in l2_3
   - This satisfies part of constraint 9 (p2 in l2_3)
5. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
   - t2 (with p1, p2) is now in l2_1
6. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
   - p2 is now in l2_1
   - This satisfies constraint 2 (p2 in l2_1)
7. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
   - p2 is now in t2
8. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
   - t2 (with p1, p2) is now in l2_4
9. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
   - p2 is now in l2_4
   - This satisfies constraint 3 (p2 in l2_4 after being in l2_1)
10. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
    - t2 (with p1) is now in l2_1
11. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
    - p1 is now in l2_1
    - This achieves the goal for p1
12. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (invalid as t2 is now in l2_1)

I keep making the same error. Let me try again with a clearer plan:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
3. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
4. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2
5. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
6. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
   - At this point: p1 is in t2, p2 is in l2_1, t2 is in l2_1
7. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
   - At this point: p1 is in t2, p2 is in t2, t2 is in l2_1
8. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
   - At this point: p1 is in t2, p2 is in t2, t2 is in l2_4
9. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
   - At this point: p1 is in t2, p2 is in l2_4, t2 is in l2_4
10. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
    - At this point: p1 is in t2, p2 is in l2_4, t2 is in l2_1
11. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
    - At this point: p1 is in l2_1, p2 is in l2_4, t2 is in l2_1
12. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
    - At this point: p1 is in a2, p2 is in l2_4, t2 is in l2_1, a2 is in l2_1
13. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
    - At this point: p1 is in a2, p2 is in l2_4, t2 is in l2_1, a2 is in l1_1
14. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
    - At this point: p1 is in l1_1, p2 is in l2_4, t2 is in l2_1, a2 is in l1_1
15. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
    - At this point: p1 is in l1_1, p2 is in l2_4, t1 is in l1_1, t2 is in l2_1, a2 is in l1_1
16. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
    - At this point: p1 is in t1, p2 is in l2_4, t1 is in l1_1, t2 is in l2_1, a2 is in l1_1
17. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
    - At this point: p1 is in t1, p2 is in l2_4, t1 is in l1_4, t2 is in l2_1, a2 is in l1_1
18. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
    - At this point: p1 is in t1, p2 is in l2_4, t1 is in l1_4, t2 is in l2_4, a2 is in l1_1
19. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
    - At this point: p1 is in t1, p2 is in t2, t1 is in l1_4, t2 is in l2_4, a2 is in l1_1
20. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
    - At this point: p1 is in t1, p2 is in t2, t1 is in l1_4, t2 is in l2_1, a2 is in l1_1
21. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
    - At this point: p1 is in t1, p2 is in l2_1, t1 is in l1_4, t2 is in l2_1, a2 is in l1_1
22. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (invalid as a2 is in l1_1)

Ok, let me retry with a fresh plan:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
3. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
4. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2 (satisfying constraint 9 - p2 in l2_3)
5. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
6. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (satisfying constraint 2 - p2 in l2_1)
7. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
8. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
9. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (satisfying constraint 1 - p1 in l1_1)
10. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
11. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
12. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (satisfying constraint 7 - p1 in t1)
13. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1 (satisfying constraint 6 - p1 in l1_4)
14. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (invalid as a2 is now in l1_1)
