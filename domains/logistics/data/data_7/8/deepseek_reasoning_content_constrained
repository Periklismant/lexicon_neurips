Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. First, I need to understand the initial state, the goal, and the constraints. The goal is to get package p1 to l2_5 and p2 to l1_2. The constraints are a bit complex, so I have to make sure each one is satisfied at some point in the plan.

Looking at the initial state:

- p1 is in l2_3 (city c2)
- p2 is in l1_1 (city c1, which is an airport)
- Trucks t1 is in l1_2 (c1), t2 in l2_4 (c2)
- Airplanes a1 is in l1_1 (c1's airport), a2 in l2_1 (c2's airport)

So, for p1 to get to l2_5 (c2), which is a city c2 location. Since it's in c2, maybe use truck t2. But t2 is in l2_4. So first, maybe move t2 from l2_4 to l2_3 to pick up p1, then drive to l2_5 and unload.

But wait, p1 is in l2_3. So if t2 is in l2_4, how can it pick up p1? Maybe drive t2 to l2_3, load p1 into t2, then drive to l2_5 and unload. That seems straightforward.

For p2, which is in l1_1 (airport in c1). It needs to get to l1_2. But l1_1 is an airport. The truck t1 is in l1_2. So perhaps use a1 (airplane in l1_1) to transport p2? Wait, but p2 is already in l1_1. To get it to l1_2, which is in the same city, maybe use truck t1. But t1 is in l1_2. Wait, so t1 is already at l1_2. So how do we get p2 from l1_1 to l1_2? Since l1_1 is an airport, perhaps use a truck to move it. But the truck t1 is in l1_2. So maybe drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1, load p2 into t1, then drive back to l1_2 and unload. That would work. But wait, in the initial state, t1 is at l1_2. So the steps would be:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
2. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
3. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
4. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

That would get p2 to l1_2. But let's check the constraints. The constraints require several states where certain conditions are met. Let's list all constraints:

1. At least one state where p2 is in a2 and p1 is in l1_2.
2. At least one state where p2 is in l2_3.
3. At least one state where p2 is in l1_2 (which is the goal, so that's covered).
4. If p2 is in l1_2 in some state, there must be an earlier state where p1 is in l2_1 or l1_5.
5. At least one state where p2 is in a1.
6. At least one state where p2 is in l1_4.
7. At least one state where p1 is in a2 or p2 is in l2_2.
8. At least one state where p2 is in a2.

So, these constraints complicate things. Let's see how to satisfy each.

Starting with p2's movement. The initial position is l1_1 (c1's airport). To get to l1_2, using truck t1 as above seems direct. But the constraints require p2 to be in a1, a2, l1_4, l2_3, l2_2, etc. So perhaps p2 has to be transported via airplane to another city and then back? That might be necessary to satisfy the constraints.

Wait, p2's goal is in c1 (l1_2), but some constraints require it to be in c2 locations. For example, l2_3, l2_2. So maybe p2 needs to be moved to c2 and then back. Let's think.

First, moving p2 from l1_1 (c1) to l2_1 (c2's airport) using airplane a1. Then, using truck t2 in c2 to move it around. But how?

But the problem is that the goal requires p2 to be back in l1_2. So perhaps:

- Load p2 onto a1 in l1_1.
- Fly a1 to l2_1 (c2's airport).
- Unload p2 into a2? Wait, a2 is in l2_1 initially. Wait, initial state says "Package a2 is in location l2_1". Wait, no, the initial state lists "Package a1 is in location l1_1" and "Package a2 is in location l2_1". Wait, but airplanes are objects, so maybe those are their locations. So a1 is at l1_1, a2 at l2_1. So airplanes can carry packages, but they themselves are at locations.

So, to move p2 from l1_1 to l2_1, we can load p2 onto a1, fly a1 to l2_1, then unload p2 there. Then, perhaps load p2 onto a2 and fly it somewhere else, but that might not be needed. But this would require:

1. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
2. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
3. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

Now p2 is in l2_1. Then, to get it to l2_3, we need a truck in c2. Truck t2 is in l2_4. So drive t2 to l2_1 (airport), load p2, drive to l2_3, unload. Then maybe drive to l2_5 for p1's goal. But wait, p1 needs to be in l2_5. Let's handle p1 first.

p1 is in l2_3. Truck t2 is in l2_4. So drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_3, load p1, drive to l2_5, unload. That would handle p1's goal. But how does this interact with the constraints?

But let's think about the constraints again. For p2, we need it to be in a2 at some point. So perhaps after moving p2 to l2_1 (via a1), we load it into a2 and fly back. For example:

After step 3 (p2 in l2_1), load p2 onto a2, fly a2 to l1_1 (c1's airport), unload, then use truck t1 to move to l1_2. But that would involve a lot of steps. But maybe necessary to meet constraints.

Alternatively, after moving p2 to l2_1, load into a2 and fly to another city, but that might not help. Let's outline steps for p2 considering constraints:

Constraints for p2:

- Must be in a2 (twice: once as a standalone constraint, once in the first combined constraint with p1 in l1_2)
- Must be in l2_3
- Must be in l1_4
- Must be in l2_2
- Must be in a1

So, to satisfy all these, p2 has to be moved through various locations and vehicles.

Possible steps:

1. Load p2 into a1 at l1_1 (satisfies "p2 in a1")
2. Fly a1 to l2_1 (now p2 is in l2_1)
3. Unload p2 from a1 to l2_1 (now in l2_1)
4. Load p2 into a2 (satisfies "p2 in a2")
5. Fly a2 to l2_2? Wait, airports are l1_1 and l2_1. Wait, the problem states "each city may include multiple locations. One location of each city is an airport." So c1's airport is l1_1, c2's is l2_1. Other locations in cities are non-airports. Airplanes can only move between airports. So airplanes can only fly from l1_1 to l2_1 and vice versa. So, to move p2 via airplane, it has to go through airports.

So, if we fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1, then p2 is in l1_1 again. But then we can use truck t1 to move p2 to l1_4 (since l1_4 is in c1). So steps:

6. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1 (p2 is in a2 during flight, then unloaded at l1_1)
But wait, if we load p2 into a2 in l2_1, then fly a2 to l1_1, unload p2 there. Then p2 is back in l1_1. Then use truck t1 to move to l1_4:

7. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1 (if it's possible, since t1 is in l1_2 initially)
Wait, initial state says "Package t1 is in location l1_2". Wait, no, the initial state lists "Package t1 is in location l1_2" — but t1 is a truck. So trucks are objects located in locations, not packages. So the initial state should have "Truck t1 is in location l1_2". But according to the given original state:

Wait, the user wrote:

The original state of the world is the following:
...
"Package t1 is in location l1_2"
"Package t2 is in location l2_4"
"Package p1 is in location l2_3"
"Package p2 is in location l1_1"
"Package a1 is in location l1_1"
"Package a2 is in location l2_1"

Wait, that's a problem. Because t1 and t2 are trucks, not packages. Similarly, a1 and a2 are airplanes, not packages. So this seems like a mistake in the problem statement. Or perhaps it's a typo. For example, maybe it's supposed to be "Truck t1 is in location l1_2", "Airplane a1 is in location l1_1", etc. Otherwise, the initial state is invalid because you can't load a truck into another truck.

Assuming that's a typo, and the correct initial state is:

Truck t1 is in l1_2

Truck t2 is in l2_4

Airplane a1 is in l1_1

Airplane a2 is in l2_1

Packages p1 in l2_3, p2 in l1_1.

Otherwise, the problem is impossible because you can't load packages into trucks that are themselves packages.

So I'll proceed under that correction.

So, initial state:

Trucks:

- t1 in l1_2 (c1)
- t2 in l2_4 (c2)

Airplanes:

- a1 in l1_1 (c1's airport)
- a2 in l2_1 (c2's airport)

Packages:

- p1 in l2_3 (c2)
- p2 in l1_1 (c1's airport)

So, back to moving p2.

First, load p2 into a1 at l1_1. Then fly a1 to l2_1. Now p2 is in l2_1. Then, unload p2 from a1 into l2_1. Then, load p2 into a2 (satisfies constraint p2 in a2). Then fly a2 to l1_1. Unload p2 into l1_1. Now, to get p2 to l1_2, use truck t1.

But truck t1 is in l1_2. So drive t1 to l1_1 (airport), load p2, drive back to l1_2, unload.

But along the way, we can also make p2 go through l1_4. For example, after unloading p2 in l1_1 via a2, drive t1 to l1_1, load p2, then drive to l1_4, unload (satisfies p2 in l1_4), then drive to l1_2 and unload again. But that adds steps. However, the plan needs to be optimal, so we can't have unnecessary steps. So perhaps we need to find a way to satisfy all constraints with minimal steps.

Alternatively, maybe during the movement of p2, we can have it pass through required locations.

Let me outline possible steps for p2:

1. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (now p2 is in a1, satisfying "p2 in a1" constraint)
2. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (now a1 is in l2_1, p2 is still inside)
3. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (p2 is now in l2_1, which is c2's airport)
   - Now, need to get p2 into a2. Load into a2 here.
4. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (satisfies "p2 in a2" and the first constraint when combined with p1 in l1_2)
5. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (now a2 is in l1_1)
6. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (p2 back in l1_1)
   - Now, use truck t1 to move p2 to l1_4 and then to l1_2.
7. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
8. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
9. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1 (now p2 is in l1_4, satisfying that constraint)
10. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
11. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1
12. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (wait, no, after unloading, p2 is in l1_4. So to get it back into the truck, need to load again. But this adds steps. Alternatively, after step 9, unload at l1_4 (step 10), then load again (step 11?), but that's more steps. Hmm.

But maybe there's a smarter way. Let's see. After step 6, p2 is in l1_1. To get to l1_2, which is where truck t1 starts. So steps:

7. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 (drive to airport)
8. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
9. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1 (drive to l1_4)
10. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (satisfies "p2 in l1_4")
11. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
12. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1
13. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (goal)

This way, p2 is in l1_4 (step 10), which satisfies that constraint. Also, step 4 (p2 in a2) satisfies two constraints: "p2 in a2" and the first combined constraint (if p2 is in a2 and p1 is in l1_2 at the same time). But when is p1 in l1_2? The goal is to have p2 in l1_2, but p1's goal is l2_5. So p1 needs to be moved from l2_3 to l2_5 via truck t2.

Now, for p1:

Initial location l2_3. Truck t2 is in l2_4. So steps:

A. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2 (drive to p1's location)
B. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
C. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2
D. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (goal)

But during this movement, we need to satisfy the constraints related to p1. For example, constraint 4: If p2 is in l1_2 (which happens in step 13), then there must be an earlier state where p1 is in l2_1 or l1_5. But p1 starts in l2_3, and the plan above moves it to l2_5. So unless we have p1 in l2_1 or l1_5 at some point before step 13, the constraint is violated.

How to satisfy this? The only way is to have p1 in l2_1 or l1_5 before p2 is in l1_2.

l2_1 is an airport in c2. To get p1 to l2_1, we can use airplane a2. But p1 starts in l2_3. So steps:

- Load p1 into truck t2, drive to l2_1 (airport), load into a2, fly to another city, then unload. But why? Because we need p1 to be in l2_1 or l1_5 before p2 is in l1_2.

Wait, l1_5 is in c1. So getting p1 to l1_5 would require flying it to c1. But that's more complex. Let's see.

If we take p1 to l2_1 (c2's airport), then load it into a2, fly to l1_1 (c1's airport), unload, then use truck t1 to move to l1_5. But that's a lot of steps. But maybe necessary for the constraint.

Alternatively, after moving p1 to l2_5 (its goal), but that's after p2 is in l1_2. Wait, no. The constraint says that if p2 is in l1_2 in some state, there must be an earlier state where p1 is in l2_1 or l1_5. So p1 has to be in one of those locations before p2 reaches l1_2.

But in the current plan for p2, p2 reaches l1_2 at step 13. So p1 must be in l2_1 or l1_5 before step 13.

So perhaps during p1's transportation, we can make a detour. For example:

For p1's plan:

A. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2 (load p1)
B. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
C. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2 (drive to airport)
   - Now p1 is in l2_1 (satisfies the constraint)
D. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
E. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (since a2 is there)
F. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l2_1 (no, that's the same location. Maybe fly to l1_1? But why? To get to l1_5?)

Alternatively, after unloading p1 at l2_1 (step D), perhaps load it into airplane a2 and fly to l1_1 (c1's airport), then unload and use truck t1 to take it to l1_5. But this seems like a lot of steps, but necessary for the constraint.

So steps for p1:

A. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2
B. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
C. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2 (now p1 is in l2_1, satisfying constraint 4's condition)
D. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
E. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (now p1 is in a2, which might help with constraint 7: "p1 is in a2 or p2 in l2_2")
F. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 c1's airport (but the fly action is flyairplane ap l_from l_to; cities aren't part of the arguments. So fly from l2_1 to l1_1.
G. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
H. Now, to get p1 to l1_5, use truck t1:
   drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
   loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
   drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
   unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 (now p1 is in l1_5, which also satisfies constraint 4)
I. Then, to get p1 back to c2 for its goal, need to load into airplane a1:
   loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (but a1 is in l1_1)
   flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
   unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
   load into truck t2 again, drive to l2_5.

This is getting very complicated and making the plan longer. The problem requires an optimal plan, so this approach might not be optimal. Let's think if there's a way to satisfy the constraints without moving p1 out of c2.

Wait, the constraint 4 requires that when p2 is in l1_2, there must have been a prior state where p1 is in l2_1 or l1_5. So if during p1's transportation to l2_5, we route it through l2_1, that would satisfy the condition.

For example:

Original p1 plan:

A. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2
B. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
C. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2 (p1 is in l2_1)
D. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (now p1 is in l2_1, satisfying the condition)
E. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (again)
F. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
G. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

This way, p1 is in l2_1 (step D) before p2 is in l1_2 (step 13). This would satisfy constraint 4. Also, step E and F would move p1 to its goal.

But then, during step D, p1 is in l2_1, which is one of the required conditions for constraint 4. So this would work.

But also, during this process, p1 is loaded into t2 again after being unloaded. But maybe there's a way to avoid unloading and reloading. Alternatively, perhaps after loading p1 into t2 at l2_3, drive to l2_1, but keep it in the truck. So:

A. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2
B. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
C. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2 (now t2 is in l2_1, p1 is in t2)
   - So p1 is in t2, which is in l2_1. Does this count as p1 being in l2_1? Because the location of the package is the same as the truck's location when it's in the truck. Wait, no. The package is in the truck, not in the location. So to have p1 in l2_1, it needs to be unloaded there.

So to satisfy the constraint, we need p1 to be in l2_1 (unloaded) or l1_5. So, perhaps:

After step C, unload p1 in l2_1 (step D), then load it again (step E), then drive to l2_5.

This adds steps but satisfies the constraint.

So steps for p1:

A. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2
B. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
C. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
D. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (p1 in l2_1)
E. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
F. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
G. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (goal)

This way, in step D, p1 is in l2_1, which satisfies constraint 4. Then steps E-G complete p1's movement.

Now, let's check the constraints:

1. At least one state where p2 is in a2 and p1 is in l1_2. Wait, when is p1 in l1_2? The goal is p1 in l2_5. So unless there's a step where p1 is moved to l1_2, which isn't part of the plan. So perhaps this constraint requires both conditions in the same state. But according to the current plan, p1 is never in l1_2, but p2 is in a2 (step 4). So how to satisfy this?

The first constraint says: "The following conditions are all true: p2 is in a2, p1 is in l1_2". So both must be true at the same time.

But in the current plan, p1 is never in l1_2. The goal for p1 is l2_5. So this is a problem. How can we satisfy this constraint?

This means that at some point in the plan, both p2 is in a2 and p1 is in l1_2 must hold. But p1 is supposed to end up in l2_5, and l1_2 is in c1. So how can p1 be in l1_2?

This suggests that p1 has to be moved to c1, specifically l1_2, at some point. But that's not part of the goal. So the plan must include moving p1 to l1_2 temporarily to satisfy this constraint, then move it back to c2.

But that would add steps, but since the problem requires an optimal plan, we need to find a way to do this with minimal steps.

Let's think. To get p1 to l1_2 (c1), we need to use an airplane. For example:

- After p1 is in l2_1 (step D), load it into a2, fly to l1_1, unload, then use truck t1 to drive to l1_2. Then, load back into a1, fly to l2_1, unload, load into t2, drive to l2_5.

But this adds many steps. But perhaps necessary for the constraint.

Alternatively, maybe during the process of moving p2, we can have a state where p1 is in l1_2 and p2 is in a2.

Let me outline:

Suppose after p2 is loaded into a2 (step 4), and before flying to l1_1, we fly a2 to l1_1, unload p2 into l1_1. Then, load p1 into a2 (but p1 is in l2_1). Wait, no. Or maybe during another part of the plan.

This is getting very complicated. Let's try to outline the entire plan step by step, integrating all constraints.

Here's an attempt:

For p2:

1. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (p2 in a1)
   - Satisfies constraint: p2 in a1
2. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
3. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (p2 in l2_1)
4. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (p2 in a2)
   - Satisfies constraints: p2 in a2 (two constraints)
5. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
6. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (p2 back in l1_1)
7. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
8. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
9. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
10. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (p2 in l1_4)
11. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1
12. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (p2's goal)

For p1:

A. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2
B. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
C. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
D. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (p1 in l2_1)
   - Satisfies constraint 4 (earlier state where p1 is in l2_1 before p2's final step 12)
E. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (now p1 is in a2)
   - Satisfies constraint 7 (p1 in a2)
F. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
G. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
H. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 (t1 is at l1_1 from step 7)
   Wait, t1 was driven to l1_1 in step 7, then to l1_4 in step 9, then back to l1_2 in step 11. So after step 12, t1 is in l1_2 again. So maybe after step 12, we need to drive t1 to l1_1 again to load p1.

But this is getting too tangled. Let's see:

After step G, p1 is in l1_1. To get it to l2_5, we need to move it back to c2. So:

I. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (a1 is in l1_1 after step 2)
J. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
K. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
L. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (t2 is in l2_1 after step C and D)
   But t2 was at l2_1 after step C, but after D, it's still in l2_1. So steps:

C. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2 (t2 in l2_1)
D. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (p1 in l2_1)
E. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (p1 in a2)
F. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
G. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (p1 in l1_1)
H. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 (after step 12, t1 is back in l1_2)
   So after step 12, t1 is in l1_2. To load p1 from l1_1, need to drive t1 to l1_1 again.
H. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
I. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
J. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1 (returning)
K. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 (now p1 is in l1_2)
   - Now, this satisfies the first constraint: p2 is in a2 (step 4) and p1 is in l1_2 (step K). But step 4 is before step K, so at step K, p2 is in a2? Wait, no. At step 4, p2 is loaded into a2, then in step 5, a2 flies to l1_1, then step 6 unloads p2 into l1_1. So by step K, p2 is in l1_1 (step 6), then moved to l1_4 (step 10), then to l1_2 (step 12). So at step K, p2 is in l1_2, but the constraint requires p2 to be in a2 and p1 in l1_2 at the same time. So this isn't achieved.

This is getting too complicated. Let's try to find a way to have both p2 in a2 and p1 in l1_2 at the same time.

Perhaps after loading p2 into a2 (step 4), before flying a2 to l1_1, we can fly a2 to l1_1, then unload p2 into l1_1, then load p1 into a2 (but p1 is in l2_1). Alternatively, after step E (p1 loaded into a2), when a2 is in l2_1, fly to l1_1, but then p1 is in a2 in l1_1. Then unload p1 into l1_1, use truck t1 to move to l1_2. Then, p1 is in l1_2. At the same time, p2 is in a2 (during the flight). But this requires precise timing.

For example:

Steps:

For p2:

1. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (p2 in a1)
2. fly a1 to l2_1
3. unload p2 into l2_1
4. load p2 into a2 (now p2 in a2)
5. fly a2 to l1_1 (p2 in a2 during flight)
6. unload p2 into l1_1
...

For p1:

A. drive t2 to l2_3, load p1
B. drive to l2_1, unload p1 (now p1 in l2_1)
C. load p1 into a2
D. fly a2 to l1_1 (now p1 in a2)
E. unload p1 into l1_1
F. drive t1 to l1_1, load p1, drive to l1_2, unload (p1 in l1_2)

Now, during step D (flying a2 from l2_1 to l1_1), a2 is carrying both p1 and p2? Wait, no. Because when you load p2 into a2 in step 4, then fly to l1_1, then unload p2 (step 6). Then later, load p1 into a2 (step C), fly again. But this would require multiple flights.

Alternatively, during the flight of a2 from l2_1 to l1_1 (step 5), a2 is carrying p2. Then, after unloading p2 (step 6), a2 is empty. Then, when p1 is loaded into a2 (step C), a2 is at l2_1 again. Wait, no. After step 5, a2 is at l1_1. So to load p1 into a2, we need to fly a2 back to l2_1.

This is getting too time-consuming. Let's think differently.

Maybe combine the transport of p1 and p2 in a way that satisfies the constraints.

Here's a possible plan:

1. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (p2 in a1)
2. fly a1 l1_1 l2_1
3. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (p2 in l2_1)
4. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (p2 in a2)
   - Now, p2 is in a2. We need to have p1 in l1_2 at the same time. But p1 is in l2_3. So how?
5. fly a2 l2_1 l1_1 (carrying p2)
6. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (p2 in l1_1)
7. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
8. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
9. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
10. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (p2 in l1_4)
11. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1
12. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (p2's goal)

For p1:

A. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2
B. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
C. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2 (p1 in t2 at l2_1)
D. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (p1 in l2_1)
E. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (now p1 in a2)
   - This satisfies constraint 7 (p1 in a2)
F. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (now p1 in a2 in l1_1)
G. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (p1 in l1_1)
H. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 (t1 is in l1_2 initially)
I. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
J. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
K. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 (p1 in l1_2)
   - Now, we need to get p1 back to c2. So:
L. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_2 (but a1 is in l2_1 after step 2. Wait, no. a1 is in l2_1 after step 2. To load p1 into a1, need a1 to be in l1_2, which isn't possible because airports are l1_1 and l2_1.

So this approach isn't working. Let's think again.

At step K, p1 is in l1_2. But to satisfy the first constraint, we need p2 to be in a2 and p1 in l1_2 at the same time. The only time p2 is in a2 is during steps 4 and 5 (when it's loaded into a2 and during the flight to l1_1). So during step 5, when a2 is flying from l2_1 to l1_1, p2 is in a2. At that same time, if p1 is in l1_2, then the constraint is satisfied. But how to have p1 in l1_2 during that time?

This requires:

- p1 is moved to l1_2 before step 5.

But p1 starts in l2_3. To get to l1_2, which is in c1, requires flying. So steps:

For p1:

A. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2
B. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
C. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2 (p1 in t2 at l2_1)
D. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (p1 in l2_1)
E. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (p1 in a2)
F. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (p1 in a2 during flight)
G. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (p1 in l1_1)
H. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
I. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
J. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
K. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 (p1 in l1_2)

Now, during step F (flying a2 from l2_1 to l1_1), a2 is carrying p1. But also, during step 5 (flying a2 with p2), when does that happen?

Wait, in the previous plan for p2, step 5 is fly a2 l2_1 l1_1 (with p2). But in p1's plan, step F is fly a2 l2_1 l1_1 (with p1). So we can't do both unless we have two different flights. But a2 can't be in two places at once.

This suggests that we need to sequence the flights properly. For example:

1. load p2 into a1, fly to l2_1, unload.
2. load p2 into a2.
3. fly a2 to l1_1 (carrying p2), unload.
4. Then, load p1 into a2 and fly back.

But this would require multiple flights for a2.

Alternatively, use different airplanes. a1 and a2 are available.

But this is getting too complicated. Let's try to outline the entire plan with all constraints considered, step by step.

Final plan outline:

Actions for p2:

1. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (p2 in a1)
   - Satisfies constraint: p2 in a1
2. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
3. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (p2 in l2_1)
4. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (p2 in a2)
   - Satisfies constraint: p2 in a2 (two constraints)
5. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
6. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (p2 in l1_1)
7. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
8. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
9. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
10. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (p2 in l1_4)
11. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1
12. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (p2's goal)

Actions for p1:

A. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2
B. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
C. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2 (t2 in l2_1)
D. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (p1 in l2_1) → satisfies constraint 4
E. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (p1 in a2) → satisfies constraint 7 (p1 in a2)
F. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
G. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (p1 in l1_1)
H. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 (this happens after step 7, but t1 is already at l1_1 after step 7. Wait, step 7 is part of p2's plan. So in the overall plan, steps are interleaved.

Let's interleave the steps:

1. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
2. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
3. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
4. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
   - At this point, p2 is in a2. Now, need to get p1 into l1_2 while p2 is in a2.
5. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2 (Action A)
6. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (Action B)
7. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2 (Action C)
8. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (Action D) → p1 in l2_1
9. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (Action E) → p1 in a2
   - Now, a2 is in l2_1, loaded with p2 (from step 4) and p1? No, step 4 loaded p2 into a2. But step 9 loads p1 into a2, which would require a2 to be in l2_1. But a2 is in l2_1, but already has p2 loaded. Can a2 carry both packages? The problem doesn't say that airplanes can't carry multiple packages. Assuming they can, then step 4 and 9 both load into a2.

But after step 4, a2 is in l2_1 with p2. Then, step 9 loads p1 into a2. So a2 now has both p1 and p2.

10. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (Action F)
   - During this flight, both p1 and p2 are in a2. This satisfies the first constraint if during this flight, p1 is in a2 and p2 is in a2. But the first constraint requires p1 to be in l1_2 and p2 in a2 at the same time. So this doesn't satisfy it. So we need another approach.

This is getting too complicated. Given time constraints, I'll try to present a possible plan that meets all the constraints, even if it's not optimal. But the user requested an optimal plan. Given the complexity, perhaps the optimal plan is as follows:

```
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
```

But this doesn't meet the constraints. So I must find a better way.

After careful consideration, the optimal plan would involve moving p2 through a1 and a2 to satisfy the constraints, and p1 through t2 with a detour to l2_1. The constraints require multiple states where p2 is in various locations and vehicles. The final answer will be structured to include these steps while achieving the goals.
