Let's start by understanding the problem.

We have two cities, city c1 and city c2. Each city contains several locations, including an airport. The locations in city c1 are l1_1 (the airport), l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, and l1_5. The locations in city c2 are l2_1 (the airport), l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, and l2_5.

We have two trucks, t1 and t2, and two airplanes, a1 and a2. We also have two packages, p1 and p2.

The initial state is:
- t1 is in location l1_2
- t2 is in location l2_5
- p1 is in location l1_1
- p2 is in location l1_2
- a1 is in location l1_1
- a2 is in location l2_1

The goal is to have:
- p1 in location l1_3
- p2 in location l2_3

There are also the following constraints:
1. p1 must be in location l1_4 at some point.
2. p2 must be in location l1_1 at some point.
3. If p2 is in location l1_1, then at that point or later, either p1 is in location l1_5 or p2 is in location l1_4.
4. p1 must be in location l1_1 at some point.
5. If p1 is in location l1_1, then at that point or later, either p2 is in location l1_2 or p1 is in location l2_4.
6. p2 must be in location l2_1 at some point.
7. If p2 is in location l2_1, then there must have been an earlier state where p1 was in location l2_1.
8. At some point, both p1 and p2 must be in location l2_4.
9. At some point, p2 must be in location l2_4 and p1 must be in truck t2.
10. p2 must be in airplane a2 at some point.

Actually, wait. There seems to be a mistake in the initial state. It says "Package t1 is in location l1_2" and "Package t2 is in location l2_5", but t1 and t2 are trucks, not packages. Let me assume that what is meant is:
- truck t1 is in location l1_2
- truck t2 is in location l2_5

Now, let's begin planning. The goal is to have p1 in l1_3 and p2 in l2_3. Let's try to determine an optimal plan by considering the constraints.

First of all, p1 starts in l1_1. Constraint 5 states that if p1 is in l1_1, then at that point or later, either p2 is in l1_2 or p1 is in l2_4. From the initial state, p2 is already in l1_2, so this constraint is satisfied from the beginning.

Constraint 1 states that p1 must be in l1_4 at some point, and the final goal requires p1 to be in l1_3. So p1 needs to move from l1_1 to l1_4 and then to l1_3. We could use truck t1, which is in l1_2, for this.

Constraint 4 states that p1 must be in l1_1 at some point, which is already true in the initial state.

Constraint 7 states that if p2 is in l2_1, then there must have been an earlier state where p1 was in l2_1. This means p1 must be moved to l2_1 before p2 is moved there. Since both p1 and p2 need to be moved to city c2, they should be transported by airplane.

Constraint 8 requires both p1 and p2 to be in l2_4 at some point. Constraint 9 specifies that at one point, p2 must be in l2_4 and p1 must be in truck t2.

Constraint 10 requires p2 to be in airplane a2 at some point. This means p2 needs to be loaded onto a2, likely for transportation between cities.

Alright, let's try to formulate a plan, considering all these constraints.

Starting state:
p1 is in l1_1
p2 is in l1_2
t1 is in l1_2
t2 is in l2_5
a1 is in l1_1
a2 is in l2_1

Constraint 7 (regarding p1 needing to be in l2_1 before p2) is a bit challenging, since p2 needs to be in l1_1 (constraint 2) at some point, and then p2 also needs to be in l2_1 (constraint 6) at some point.

Let's work on moving p1 first. It starts in l1_1, satisfying constraint 4. We need to move it to l1_4 (constraint 1), and eventually to l1_3 (final goal). But we also need to move it to l2_1 (constraint 7) before moving p2 there. And at some point, both p1 and p2 need to be in l2_4 (constraint 8), with p1 being in truck t2 while p2 is in l2_4 (constraint 9). 

Let's try to devise an efficient path for p1.

For p1, here's a possible path:
l1_1 -> (by air a1) -> l2_1 -> (by truck t2) -> l2_4 -> (by truck t2) -> l2_5 -> (by truck t2) -> l2_1 -> (by air a1) -> l1_1 -> (by truck t1) -> l1_2 -> (by truck t1) -> l1_3 -> (by truck t1) -> l1_4 -> (by truck t1) -> l1_5 -> (by truck t1) -> l1_3 (final goal)

For p2, a possible path:
l1_2 -> (by truck t1) -> l1_1 -> (by air a1) -> l2_1 -> (by truck t2) -> l2_4 -> (by truck t2) -> l2_3 (final goal)

But this doesn't consider constraint 10 (p2 must be in a2 at some point). And it's also a quite complex plan for p1.

Let's reconsider.

Since p1 and p2 need to be in different cities at the end (p1 in l1_3, p2 in l2_3), and they need to be in l2_4 together at some point (constraint 8), and p2 needs to be in a2 at some point (constraint 10), it seems like we should use both airplanes for the transportation.

Let's try to break this down step by step.

First, let's consider transporting p1 to l2_1 (to satisfy constraint 7 before bringing p2 there).

1. p1 is initially in l1_1.
2. a1 is also in l1_1, so we can load p1 into a1.
3. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
4. Unload p1 from a1 in l2_1. Now p1 is in l2_1, satisfying part of constraint 7.

Now, let's consider moving p2.

5. p2 is initially in l1_2.
6. t1 is also in l1_2, so we can load p2 into t1.
7. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1 (the airport).
8. Unload p2 from t1 in l1_1. Now p2 is in l1_1, satisfying constraint 2.
Now, according to constraint 3, after p2 is in l1_1, we need either p1 in l1_5 or p2 in l1_4. Let's go with the latter, since p1 is currently in l2_1.
9. Load p2 into t1 in l1_1.
10. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_4.
11. Unload p2 from t1 in l1_4. Now p2 is in l1_4, satisfying constraint 3.

Now, we need to move p2 to l2_1 (constraint 6), but remember that p1 is already in l2_1, so it's safe to move p2 there now.

12. Load p2 into t1 in l1_4.
13. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1 (the airport).
14. Unload p2 from t1 in l1_1.
15. Load p2 into a1 in l1_1.
16. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
17. Unload p2 from a1 in l2_1. Now p2 is in l2_1, satisfying constraint 6. 

Wait, but we also need p2 to be in a2, which is at l2_1. Let's adjust the plan.

15. Load p2 into a2 in l2_1. Now p2 is in a2, satisfying constraint 10.
16. Unload p2 from a2 in l2_1.

Now, we need to move p1 and p2 to l2_4 (constraint 8), and at one point, p1 should be in t2 while p2 is in l2_4 (constraint 9).

17. Load p1 into t2 in l2_1.
18. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4.
19. Load p2 into t2 in l2_1.
20. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4 with both p1 and p2.
21. Unload p2 from t2 in l2_4. Now p2 is in l2_4 and p1 is still in t2, satisfying constraint 9.
22. Unload p1 from t2 in l2_4. Now both p1 and p2 are in l2_4, satisfying constraint 8.

Wait, I realize there's a problem here. In step 17, I load p1 into t2 in l2_1, and in step 18, I drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4. Then in step 19, I try to load p2 into t2 in l2_1, but t2 is now in l2_4, not l2_1. Let me redo that.

17. Load p1 into t2 in l2_1.
18. Load p2 into t2 in l2_1. 
19. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4 with both p1 and p2.
20. Unload p2 from t2 in l2_4. Now p2 is in l2_4 and p1 is still in t2, satisfying constraint 9.
21. Unload p1 from t2 in l2_4. Now both p1 and p2 are in l2_4, satisfying constraint 8.

Now, we need to move p2 to l2_3 (the final goal) and p1 to l1_3 (the final goal). But constraint 5 also requires that at some point after p1 is in l1_1, either p2 is in l1_2 or p1 is in l2_4. Actually, we already satisfied this because p1 is in l2_4 in step 21.

So now, let's move p2 to l2_3 and p1 to l1_3.

22. Load p2 into t2 in l2_4.
23. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_3.
24. Unload p2 from t2 in l2_3. Now p2 is in l2_3, achieving part of the final goal.

Now for p1, we need to move it from l2_4 to l1_3, and along the way, it should be in l1_4 (constraint 1).

25. Load p1 into t2 in l2_4.
26. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1 (the airport).
27. Unload p1 from t2 in l2_1.
28. Load p1 into a1 in l2_1.
29. Fly a1 from l2_1 to l1_1.
30. Unload p1 from a1 in l1_1. 
31. Load p1 into t1 in l1_1.
32. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_4.
33. Unload p1 from t1 in l1_4. Now p1 is in l1_4, satisfying constraint 1.
34. Load p1 into t1 in l1_4.
35. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_3.
36. Unload p1 from t1 in l1_3. Now p1 is in l1_3, achieving the other part of the final goal.

Hmm, but wait. I'm still not entirely sure if the constraints have been satisfied, particularly for constraint 3 (after p2 is in l1_1, either p1 is in l1_5 or p2 is in l1_4) and constraint 5 (after p1 is in l1_1, either p2 is in l1_2 or p1 is in l2_4).

For constraint 3, when p2 is in l1_1 (step 8 in my plan), p1 is in l2_1, and we then move p2 to l1_4 in steps 9-11, so this is satisfied.

For constraint 5, p1 is in l1_1 initially. In the initial state, p2 is in l1_2, which satisfies this constraint. But also, later in the plan (step 21), p1 is in l2_4, which would also satisfy it.

So it seems that my plan satisfies all the constraints. Let me double-check the steps:

1. Load p1 into a1 in l1_1.
2. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
3. Unload p1 from a1 in l2_1.

4. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1.
5. Load p2 into t1 in l1_2. (I realize here I mistakenly had the truck move first, but actually the package needs to be loaded first)
6. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1.
7. Unload p2 from t1 in l1_1.
8. Load p2 into t1 in l1_1.
9. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_4.
10. Unload p2 from t1 in l1_4.
11. Load p2 into t1 in l1_4.
12. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1.
13. Unload p2 from t1 in l1_1.
14. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1. (I realize here I mistakenly assumed a2 was in l1_1, but it's in l2_1)
15. Load p2 into a2 in l1_1.
16. Fly a2 from l1_1 to l2_1.
17. Unload p2 from a2 in l2_1.

Wait, I think I've made some logical errors. Let me restart the plan.

Initial state:
p1 is in l1_1
p2 is in l1_2
t1 is in l1_2
t2 is in l2_5
a1 is in l1_1
a2 is in l2_1

First, let's deal with constraint 7, which states that if p2 is in l2_1, then p1 must have been in l2_1 earlier. Therefore, we need to move p1 to l2_1 before moving p2 there.

1. Load p1 into a1 in l1_1.
2. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
3. Unload p1 from a1 in l2_1. Now p1 is in l2_1.

Next, let's load p2 into t1, drive it to the airport, and then fly it to l2_1 (after loading it onto a1).

4. Load p2 into t1 in l1_2.
5. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1 (the airport).
6. Unload p2 from t1 in l1_1. Now p2 is in l1_1, satisfying constraint 2.

Here we should satisfy constraint 3: after p2 is in l1_1, either p1 should be in l1_5 or p2 should be in l1_4. But p1 is in l2_1, so we need to move p2 to l1_4.

7. Load p2 into t1 in l1_1.
8. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_4.
9. Unload p2 from t1 in l1_4. Now p2 is in l1_4, satisfying constraint 3.

Now, I'm realizing that this approach might not be optimal if we're considering the smallest number of steps. Let's see if I can optimize this by considering the final goal and the remaining constraints.

Final goal: p1 in l1_3, p2 in l2_3.

Remaining constraints:
1. p1 must be in l1_4 at some point.
4. p1 must be in l1_1 at some point (already satisfied in the initial state).
5. After p1 is in l1_1, either p2 must be in l1_2 or p1 must be in l2_4. (This is satisfied in the initial state since p2 is in l1_2).
6. p2 must be in l2_1 at some point.
7. (Already addressed: if p2 is in l2_1, p1 must have been in l2_1 earlier.)
8. Both p1 and p2 must be in l2_4 at some point.
9. At one point, p2 must be in l2_4 and p1 must be in truck t2.
10. p2 must be in airplane a2 at some point.

Let's continue:

10. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1.
11. Load p2 into t1 in l1_4. (I realize here I actually made a mistake, we need to load p2 first before driving).
12. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1.
13. Unload p2 from t1 in l1_1.
14. Fly a1 from l2_1 to l1_1. (Since a1 is now in l2_1 after flying there in step 2).
15. Load p2 into a1 in l1_1.
16. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
17. Unload p2 from a1 in l2_1. Now p2 is in l2_1, satisfying constraint 6.

Next, we need to satisfy constraint 10: p2 must be in a2 at some point.

18. Load p2 into a2 in l2_1.
19. Unload p2 from a2 in l2_1. Now p2 is back in l2_1, and we've satisfied constraint 10.

Now I notice a problem: p1 is in l2_1 and p2 is in l2_1 both, but t2 is in l2_5. We need to get t2 to l2_1 to load p1 and p2.

20. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1.
21. Load p1 into t2 in l2_1.
22. Load p2 into t2 in l2_1.
23. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4 with both p1 and p2.
24. Unload p2 from t2 in l2_4. Now p2 is in l2_4 and p1 is still in t2, satisfying constraint 9.
25. Unload p1 from t2 in l2_4. Now both p1 and p2 are in l2_4, satisfying constraint 8.

Now, let's move p2 to l2_3 (one part of the final goal).

26. Load p2 into t2 in l2_4.
27. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_3.
28. Unload p2 from t2 in l2_3. Now p2 is in l2_3, achieving one part of the final goal.

Next, we need to move p1 to l1_3 (the other part of the final goal). But according to constraint 1, p1 must be in l1_4 at some point.

29. Load p1 into t2 in l2_4.
30. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1 (the airport).
31. Unload p1 from t2 in l2_1.
32. Load p1 into a1 in l2_1.
33. Fly a1 from l2_1 to l1_1.
34. Unload p1 from a1 in l1_1.
35. Load p1 into t1 in l1_1.
36. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_4.
37. Unload p1 from t1 in l1_4. Now p1 is in l1_4, satisfying constraint 1.
38. Load p1 into t1 in l1_4.
39. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_3.
40. Unload p1 from t1 in l1_3. Now p1 is in l1_3, achieving the other part of the final goal.

Great, we've achieved the final goal and satisfied all the constraints!

Actually, let's double-check our plan step by step to ensure everything is consistent:

1. Load p1 into a1 in l1_1.
2. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
3. Unload p1 from a1 in l2_1. Now p1 is in l2_1.

4. Load p2 into t1 in l1_2.
5. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1.
6. Unload p2 from t1 in l1_1. Now p2 is in l1_1, satisfying constraint 2.

7. Load p2 into t1 in l1_1.
8. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_4.
9. Unload p2 from t1 in l1_4. Now p2 is in l1_4, satisfying constraint 3.

10. Load p2 into t1 in l1_4.
11. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1.
12. Unload p2 from t1 in l1_1.

13. Fly a1 from l2_1 to l1_1. (Since a1 is now in l2_1 after flying there in step 2).
14. Load p2 into a1 in l1_1.
15. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
16. Unload p2 from a1 in l2_1. Now p2 is in l2_1, satisfying constraint 6.

17. Load p2 into a2 in l2_1.
18. Unload p2 from a2 in l2_1. Now p2 is back in l2_1, and we've satisfied constraint 10.

19. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1.
20. Load p1 into t2 in l2_1.
21. Load p2 into t2 in l2_1.
22. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4 with both p1 and p2.
23. Unload p2 from t2 in l2_4. Now p2 is in l2_4 and p1 is still in t2, satisfying constraint 9.
24. Unload p1 from t2 in l2_4. Now both p1 and p2 are in l2_4, satisfying constraint 8.

25. Load p2 into t2 in l2_4.
26. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_3.
27. Unload p2 from t2 in l2_3. Now p2 is in l2_3, achieving one part of the final goal.

28. Load p1 into t2 in l2_4. (Wait, this is potentially a problem. Truck t2 could no longer be in l2_4; it's in l2_3 after step 26. Let's redo this part.).

So, correcting from step 28:

28. Drive t2 from l2_3 back to l2_4.
29. Load p1 into t2 in l2_4.
30. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
31. Unload p1 from t2 in l2_1.
32. Load p1 into a1 in l2_1.
33. Fly a1 from l2_1 to l1_1.
34. Unload p1 from a1 in l1_1.
35. Load p1 into t1 in l1_1.
36. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_4.
37. Unload p1 from t1 in l1_4. Now p1 is in l1_4, satisfying constraint 1.
38. Load p1 into t1 in l1_4.
39. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_3.
40. Unload p1 from t1 in l1_3. Now p1 is in l1_3, achieving the other part of the final goal.

Wait, I noticed that we have p1 in l2_4 in step 24, but then we have truck t2 go to l2_3, and then we in step 28 - 29 we try to load p1 into t2 but drive t2 back to l2_4.

Let's double-check p1 and p2's locations after step 24:

p1 is in l2_4.
p2 is in l2_4.

In steps 25-27, we move p2 from l2_4 to l2_3 using truck t2.

Now, we want to move p1 from l2_4 to l1_3. We need to use truck t2 to transport p1 from l2_4 to the airport (l2_1), before using airplane a1 to fly to l1_1.

So, in step 28, we first need to drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_4 to pick up p1.

Actually, I'll try to ensure that the entire plan is consistent by reorganizing it, and by tracking the locations of each entity at each step.

Initial state:
- p1 is in l1_1
- p2 is in l1_2
- t1 is in l1_2
- t2 is in l2_5
- a1 is in l1_1
- a2 is in l2_1

Moving p1 from l1_1 to l2_1 (to satisfy constraint 7, which says p1 needs to be in l2_1 before p2):
1. Load p1 into a1 in l1_1. p1 -> a1.
2. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1. a1 (with p1) -> l2_1.
3. Unload p1 from a1 in l2_1. p1 -> l2_1.

Moving p2 from l1_2 to l1_1 (to satisfy constraint 2):
4. Load p2 into t1 in l1_2. p2 -> t1.
5. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1. t1 (with p2) -> l1_1.
6. Unload p2 from t1 in l1_1. p2 -> l1_1.

Moving p2 from l1_1 to l1_4 (to satisfy constraint 3):
7. Load p2 into t1 in l1_1. p2 -> t1.

10. Load p2 into t1 in l1_4. p2 -> t1.
11. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1. t1 (with p2) -> l1_1.
12. Unload p2 from t1 in l1_1. p2 -> l1_1.
13. Fly a1 from l2_1 to l1_1. a1 -> l1_1.
14. Load p2 into a1 in l1_1. p2 -> a1.
15. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1. a1 (with p2) -> l2_1.
16. Unload p2 from a1 in l2_1. p2 -> l2_1.

Satisfying constraint 10 (p2 must be in a2 at some point):
17. Load p2 into a2 in l2_1. p2 -> a2.
18. Unload p2 from a2 in l2_1. p2 -> l2_1.

Getting ready to satisfy constraints 8 and 9 (p1 and p2 need to be in l2_4 together, and at one point, p2 in l2_4 while p1 in t2):
19. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1. t2 -> l2_1.
20. Load p1 into t2 in l2_1. p1 -> t2.
21. Load p2 into t2 in l2_1. p2 -> t2.
22. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4. t2 (with p1 and p2) -> l2_4.
23. Unload p2 from t2 in l2_4. p2 -> l2_4, p1 still in t2. (satisfying constraint 9)
24. Unload p1 from t2 in l2_4. p1 -> l2_4. (satisfying constraint 8 since both p1 and p2 are in l2_4)

Moving p2 from l2_4 to l2_3 (part of final goal):
25. Load p2 into t2 in l2_4. p2 -> t2.
26. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_3. t2 (with p2) -> l2_3.
27. Unload p2 from t2 in l2_3. p2 -> l2_3. (achieved one part of final goal)

Moving p1 from l2_4 to l1_3 (part of final goal), with a stop at l1_4 (to satisfy constraint 1):
28. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_4. t2 -> l2_4.
29. Load p1 into t2 in l2_4. p1 -> t2.
30. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1. t2 (with p1) -> l2_1.
31. Unload p1 from t2 in l2_1. p1 -> l2_1.
32. Load p1 into a1 in l2_1. p1 -> a1.
33. Fly a1 from l2_1 to l1_1. a1 (with p1) -> l1_1.
34. Unload p1 from a1 in l1_1. p1 -> l1_1.
35. Load p1 into t1 in l1_1. p1 -> t1.
36. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_4. t1 (with p1) -> l1_4.
37. Unload p1 from t1 in l1_4. p1 -> l1_4. (satisfying constraint 1)
38. Load p1 into t1 in l1_4. p1 -> t1.
39. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_3. t1 (with p1) -> l1_3.
40. Unload p1 from t1 in l1_3. p1 -> l1_3. (achieved the other part of final goal)

Now, I'm actually not sure that we need steps 17 and 18, because we could just leave p2 in a2 during the fly action and then unload it once we've landed, but for the sake of explicitly satisfying constraint 10, I've kept them.

This should be a valid plan to achieve the final goal while satisfying all constraints. However, I think we should have removed the loadairplane and unloadairplane actions when loading and unloading from the airplane and instead use the correct action names:

Correcting the action names from the 40-step plan I've just completed:

1. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
2. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
3. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

4. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
5. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
6. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

7. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
8. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
9. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

10. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
11. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
12. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

13. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
14. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
15. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
16. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

17. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
18. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

19. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
20. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
21. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
22. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
23. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
24. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

25. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
26. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2
27. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3

28. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
29. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
30. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
31. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
32. loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
33. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
34. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
35. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
36. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
37. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
38. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
39. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1
40. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3

But upon further inspection of the problem statement, it looks like I made a mistake in the action names. The correct names are:

- "loadtruck p t l" for loading a package p in a truck t at location l.
- "loadairplane p ap l" for loading a package p in an airplane ap at location l.
- "unloadtruck p t l" for unloading a package p from a truck t at location l.
- "unloadairplane p ap l" for unloading a package p from an airplane ap at location l.
- "drivetruck t l_from l_to c" for driving a truck t from location l_from to location l_to in city c.
- "flyairplane ap l_from l_to" for flying an airplane ap from location l_from to location l_to.

So, this should be the correct names for the actions in my plan:

1. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
2. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
3. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

4. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
5. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
6. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

7. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
8. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
9. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

10. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
11. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
12. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

13. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
14. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
15. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
16. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

17. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
18. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

19. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
20. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
21. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
22. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
23. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
24. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

25. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
26. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2
27. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3

28. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
29. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
30. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
31. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
32. loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
33. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
34. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
35. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
36. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
37. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
38. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
39. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1
40. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3

Wait, I think I made a mistake, because I now see:
"loadairplane p ap l": Load package p in airplane ap. Both p and ap are in location l.
"loadairplane p ap l": Unload package p from airplane ap in location l.

Are both actions had the name "loadairplane", which doesn't make sense. Let me recheck the action names.

- "loadtruck p t l": Load package p in truck t. Both p and t are in location l.
- "loadairplane p ap l": Load package p in airplane ap. Both p and ap are in location l.
- "unloadtruck p t l": Unload package p from truck t in location l.
- "loadairplane p ap l": Unload package p from airplane ap in location l.
- "drivetruck t l_from l_to c": Drive truck t from location l_from to location l_to in city c.
- "flyairplane ap l_from l_to": Fly airplane ap from location l_from to location l_to.

I think there's a typo in the problem statement. Let's assume the third and fourth actions should be "unloadtruck" and "unloadairplane" based on the descriptions.

So the final plan with corrected action names should be:

1. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
2. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
3. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

4. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
5. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
6. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

7. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
8. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
9. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

10. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
11. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
12. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

13. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
14. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
15. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
16. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

17. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
18. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

19. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2

31. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
32. loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
33. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
34. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
35. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
36. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
