Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. First, I need to understand the initial state, the goal, and the constraints. 

The initial state has packages p1 and p2 in different locations. p1 is at l1_1, which is an airport in city c1. p2 is at l1_2 in c1. The trucks t1 is at l1_2 and t2 is at l2_5. Airplanes a1 is at l1_1 (airport) and a2 is at l2_1 (airport in c2). The goal is to get p1 to l1_3 (c1) and p2 to l2_3 (c2). 

Now, the constraints are a bit complex. Let's list them out:

1. p1 must be in l1_4 at some state.
2. p2 must be in l1_1 at some state.
3. If p2 is in l1_1 (from constraint 2), then either p1 is in l1_5 or p2 is in l1_4 at that state or later.
4. p1 must be in l1_1 at some state (but it already starts there, so maybe that's satisfied initially? Wait, the original state says p1 is in l1_1. So maybe this constraint is already met. But the problem might require that during the plan, it's there again. Hmm, need to check if the initial state counts. The problem states "the following conditions must hold in at least one state", so if the initial state is included, then this is already satisfied. But perhaps the plan must ensure that p1 is again in l1_1 at some step. Wait, the original state is the starting point, so the initial state is considered. So if the constraint is that "Package p1 is in location l1_1" must hold in at least one state, then the initial state already satisfies that. But maybe after moving it, we have to bring it back? Let me check the problem statement again. The original state is the initial state, and the constraints are about the states during the plan. So if in the initial state, p1 is already in l1_1, then that constraint is satisfied. But maybe the problem requires that during the plan execution, it's there again. Wait, the problem says "must hold in at least one state"â€”so the initial state is a valid state. So that constraint is already met. So perhaps we don't need to do anything for that. However, the next constraint says if p1 is in l1_1 in some state s, then either p2 is in l1_2 or p1 is in l2_4 in s or after. Since the initial state has p1 in l1_1, then after that, in the plan, either p2 must be in l1_2 (which it is initially in l1_2) but wait, initial state of p2 is l1_2. So in the initial state, p2 is in l1_2, which would satisfy the condition. So maybe that's okay. But if during the plan, p1 is moved back to l1_1, then again we have to check. But since the initial state already satisfies the "p1 in l1_1" constraint, and the condition after that is that if in any state s (including initial) where p1 is in l1_1, then in s or after, either p2 is in l1_2 or p1 is in l2_4. Since in the initial state, p2 is already in l1_2, that's okay. So that constraint is satisfied.

Next, constraint 5: p2 must be in l2_1 at some state. The initial state has a2 in l2_1, but p2 is in l1_2. So we need to get p2 to l2_1 at some point. Also, the sixth constraint says that if p2 is in l2_1 in some state, there must be an earlier state where p1 is in l2_1. But p1 starts in l1_1 (c1), so we need to move p1 to l2_1 first. But l2_1 is in c2. How to do that? Since airplanes can fly between airports. So perhaps load p1 into a1, fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1, then unload p1 there. Then, later, when p2 is in l2_1, the constraint is met.

Constraint 7: Both p1 and p2 must be in l2_4 at some state. Constraint 8: p2 in l2_4 and p1 in t2. But t2 is a truck in l2_5 (initial location). So t2 is in c2. So to get p1 into t2, we need to transport p1 to c2, load it into t2. But p1 starts in c1. So that would require moving p1 from c1 to c2 via airplane. Similarly for p2.

Constraint 9: p2 must be in a2 at some state. Since a2 starts in l2_1. So we need to load p2 into a2 at some point.

Now, the goal is p1 in l1_3 (c1) and p2 in l2_3 (c2). Let's think about each package.

For p1: It starts in l1_1 (airport of c1). To get to l1_3, which is in c1. Trucks can move within the city. So maybe use truck t1, which is initially in l1_2. Wait, but t1 is a truck in c1. So perhaps drive t1 to l1_1, load p1 into t1, then drive to l1_3, unload. But initially, t1 is in l1_2. So drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1 (if possible, but wait, l1_1 is in c1, so yes. So drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1. Then loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1. Then drive t1 to l1_3. Then unload. But wait, the constraints require that p1 must be in l1_4 at some point. So maybe during the transportation, we need to route p1 through l1_4. For example, drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_4, then to l1_3. That way, when unloading in l1_4, p1 is there. But that adds steps. Alternatively, maybe p1 is loaded into an airplane first. Wait, but airplanes are for moving between cities. Since p1 needs to stay in c1, maybe using a truck is sufficient.

But there's also the constraint that p2 must be in l1_1. So how to get p2 there. p2 starts in l1_2. So maybe use truck t1 to move p2 to l1_1. But wait, the initial location of t1 is l1_2, so load p2 into t1 at l1_2, drive to l1_1, unload. Then p2 is in l1_1, satisfying constraint 2. But then, according to constraint 3, after that, either p1 must be in l1_5 or p2 in l1_4. So after moving p2 to l1_1, we need to ensure that in a later state, one of these is true.

But how does this fit with the other constraints? For example, constraint 5 requires p2 to be in l2_1. So after moving p2 to l1_1, we need to get it to l2_1. But l2_1 is in c2. So to move between cities, we need an airplane. So load p2 into airplane a1 (which is at l1_1), fly a1 to l2_1 (c2's airport), then unload p2 there. But then, constraint 6 says that if p2 is in l2_1, there must be a prior state where p1 is in l2_1. So before moving p2 to l2_1, p1 must have been there. So how to get p1 to l2_1? Load p1 into a1, fly a1 to l2_1, unload. Then later, when p2 is in l2_1, the constraint is satisfied.

But this adds steps. Let's outline possible steps for p1:

1. Load p1 into a1 at l1_1 (since a1 is there).
2. Fly a1 to l2_1.
3. Unload p1 in l2_1. Now p1 is in l2_1, satisfying the requirement for constraint 6 when p2 later arrives here.
4. Then, perhaps load p1 into a2 (but a2 is at l2_1 initially). Then fly a2 to another airport? But p1 needs to end up in l1_3. So maybe after moving p1 to l2_1, we need to get it back to c1. But that complicates things. Alternatively, after p1 is in l2_1, maybe load it into truck t2 (which is in l2_5). But t2 is in c2. So drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (if possible, since l2_1 is an airport in c2). But l2_1 is part of c2, so yes. So drive t2 to l2_1, load p1 into t2, then drive to l2_4 (to satisfy constraint 7 where both p1 and p2 are in l2_4). But then, how to get p1 back to c1? Maybe use another airplane. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to satisfy all constraints with fewer steps. Let's think step by step.

First, handle the constraints that require certain states:

- p1 must be in l1_4. So during transportation, perhaps p1 is unloaded there.

- p2 must be in l1_1. So we need to move p2 from l1_2 to l1_1. That's within c1, so use truck t1.

- p2 must be in l2_1. So after being in l1_1, we need to fly it to l2_1. But before that, p1 must have been in l2_1.

So steps for p1 to reach l2_1:

- Load p1 into a1 at l1_1.

- Fly a1 to l2_1.

- Unload p1 in l2_1. Now p1 is there.

Then, p2's path:

- Load p2 into t1 at l1_2.

- Drive t1 to l1_1.

- Unload p2 in l1_1. Now constraint 2 is satisfied. Then, according to constraint 3, after this, either p1 is in l1_5 or p2 is in l1_4. Since p1 is in l2_1 now, so maybe p2 needs to go to l1_4. But how? p2 is in l1_1. So load into t1 again, drive to l1_4, unload. Then that satisfies constraint 3. But also, after that, p2 needs to get to l2_1. So from l1_4, load into a1 (if a1 is back?), but a1 is in l2_1. So maybe after moving p1 to l2_1, a1 is there. So then, to move p2 from l1_1 to l2_1, need to use another airplane. Wait, a1 is in l2_1 after flying there. So to get back to l1_1, fly a1 back. But that would require another action. Let's see.

Alternatively, after p2 is in l1_1, load it into a1 (if a1 is there). But a1 was flown to l2_1. So maybe:

After p1 is unloaded in l2_1, fly a1 back to l1_1. Then load p2 into a1 and fly to l2_1. But this adds steps. Let's outline:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (t1 is in l1_2, p2 is there).
2. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1.
3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1. Now p2 is in l1_1 (constraint 2 met). Then, according to constraint 3, after this, either p1 in l1_5 or p2 in l1_4. So perhaps next, move p2 to l1_4. But how? Use t1 again.

4. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.
5. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1.
6. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4. Now p2 is in l1_4 (satisfies constraint 3's alternative). Then, to get p2 to l2_1, need to load into an airplane. But airplanes are in l1_1 (a1) and l2_1 (a2). So a1 is still in l1_1 (unless it was used earlier). Wait, but earlier, to get p1 to l2_1, a1 would have to fly there. Let's backtrack.

Wait, initial steps for p1:

- loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1? Wait, t1 starts in l1_2. So first, drive t1 to l1_1.

So steps for p1:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1. (precondition: t1 is in l1_2, which it is.)

Now t1 is in l1_1.

2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1. (p1 is in l1_1, t1 is there.)

Then, drive t1 to l1_3, unload. But we need to satisfy the constraint that p1 is in l1_4. So maybe drive t1 to l1_4 first.

3. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1.

4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4. Now p1 is in l1_4 (constraint 1 met).

Then, drive t1 to l1_3.

5. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1.

6. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3. Now p1 is at goal.

But this handles p1, but what about the other constraints involving p2 and other locations?

Alternatively, maybe p1 needs to go via airplane to satisfy other constraints. For example, getting p1 to l2_1 before p2 is there. Let's try integrating that.

For p1:

1. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1. (a1 is at l1_1, p1 is there.)

2. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1. (a1 flies to l2_1.)

3. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1. Now p1 is in l2_1. This allows constraint 6 to be satisfied when p2 later arrives here.

Now, to get p1 back to c1. Maybe load it into a2 (which is at l2_1), fly to l1_1, but a2 is in c2. Wait, airplanes can fly between any airports. So a2 can fly from l2_1 to l1_1. But l1_1 is in c1. So:

4. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1. (p1 is in l2_1, a2 is there.)

5. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

6. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1. Now p1 is back in l1_1. But we already have the initial state as p1 being here, but the constraint 4 requires that p1 is in l1_1 at some state. So this step might not be necessary unless the initial state is not counted, which I think it is. However, the problem says "the following expression must hold in at least one state", which includes the initial state. So maybe this is redundant. But moving p1 back to l1_1 could help with other steps. Alternatively, after p1 is in l2_1, we could use another method to get it back.

But perhaps there's a more efficient way. Let's think about p2's requirements.

p2 needs to be in l2_3 (goal), l1_1 (constraint 2), l2_1 (constraint 5), l2_4 (with p1, constraint 7), and in a2 (constraint 9). Also, in l1_4 (constraint 3). Plus, when p2 is in l2_1, p1 must have been there before (constraint 6). Also, when p2 is in l1_1, we need either p1 in l1_5 or p2 in l1_4 later.

Let's try to map out p2's path:

Start at l1_2.

1. Load into truck t1 (in l1_2), drive to l1_1, unload. Now in l1_1 (constraint 2 met). Then, according to constraint 3, after this, either p1 is in l1_5 or p2 is in l1_4. Since p1 is in l2_1 at this point (from earlier steps), we need to move p2 to l1_4. So:

2. Load p2 into t1 again (now at l1_1), drive to l1_4, unload. Now p2 in l1_4 (satisfies constraint 3).

Then, to get p2 to l2_1, need to load into an airplane. But airplanes in c1's airport (l1_1) are a1, which was flown to l2_1 earlier. So need to fly a1 back to l1_1. Let's see:

3. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1. (Assuming a1 is in l2_1 after step 2.)

4. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1.

5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1.

6. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1. Now p2 is in l2_1 (constraint 5 met), and earlier p1 was in l2_1 (from step 3), so constraint 6 is satisfied.

But also, need to have p2 in a2 (constraint 9). So maybe after p2 is in l2_1, load it into a2:

7. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1. (But a2 is at l2_1.)

8. Then, fly a2 to another location if needed, but perhaps unload immediately.

Wait, but constraint 9 is that p2 is in a2. So just loading it into a2 satisfies that. So step 7 would be sufficient.

But after that, p2 needs to reach l2_3. So after step 7, unload p2 from a2 into l2_1, then use truck t2 (in l2_5) to move it to l2_3.

But let's see:

9. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1. (Now p2 is back in l2_1.)

10. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1. (But t2 is in l2_5. Need to drive it to l2_1 first.)

So steps for t2:

a. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2.

b. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.

c. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2.

d. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3. (Goal met for p2.)

But this is getting quite involved. Also, we need to handle the constraint that p1 and p2 must be in l2_4 together. So maybe after p1 is in l2_1 (step 3), we move p1 to l2_4 using t2:

After step 3 (p1 in l2_1):

4. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2.

5. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1.

6. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2.

7. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4. Now p1 is in l2_4.

Then later, when p2 is in l2_4 (from some steps), that satisfies constraint 7. For example, after p2 is in l2_1 (step 6), maybe drive t2 to l2_4 and unload p2 there. But this would require p2 to be in t2. Let's see:

After step 6 (p2 in l2_1):

But step 6 was unloading p2 into l2_1. So to get p2 into t2, which is now in l2_1 (after step 4), we can load p2 into t2:

7. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.

8. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2.

9. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4. Now p2 is in l2_4. p1 was there earlier (step 7). So in the state after step 7, p1 is in l2_4, and after step 9, p2 is there. But the constraint 7 requires both to be there at the same time. So perhaps after both are unloaded in l2_4. But unless they are there at the same time, this isn't met. So maybe we need to have p1 and p2 both in l2_4 in the same state. That might require p1 to stay there until p2 arrives. Alternatively, load p1 into t2 again after p2 is loaded. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Additionally, constraint 8 requires that in some state, p2 is in l2_4 and p1 is in t2. So p1 must be in t2 (the truck) while p2 is in l2_4. So perhaps during transportation, when t2 is carrying p1 and arrives at l2_4, and p2 is loaded into t2 as well. But this may not be possible. Alternatively, after p1 is unloaded in l2_4, p2 is loaded into t2 and then driven to l2_4. Then, in that state, p2 is in l2_4 and p1 is in t2. Wait, no. If p1 is in t2, then t2 is in some location. For example, if t2 is in l2_4, and p1 is in t2, and p2 is in l2_4, then constraint 8 is met.

So steps for constraint 8:

After p1 is loaded into t2 (step 5), drive to l2_4 (step 6), but don't unload p1 yet. Then, p1 is in t2 (which is in l2_4). Then, p2 is loaded into t2 (which is in l2_4), then unload p2 there. But wait, how would p2 get to l2_4? Let's see:

Alternatively, after p1 is in t2 (loaded in l2_1), drive t2 to l2_4. Then p1 is in t2 at l2_4. Then, load p2 into t2 (if p2 is in l2_4). But how does p2 get there? Maybe via airplane. For example, after p2 is in l2_1 (step 6), fly it to l2_4's airport? Wait, but l2_4 is a regular location in c2, not an airport. Airplanes can only land at airports (l2_1 is the airport for c2). So to get p2 to l2_4, it must be transported by truck from l2_1. So perhaps:

After p2 is in l2_1 (step 6), load into t2 (which is in l2_1 after step 4), drive to l2_4, unload. Then p2 is in l2_4, and if p1 is in t2 (still loaded), then when t2 is in l2_4, p1 is in t2 (satisfying constraint 8). So:

Steps:

4. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2. (t2 moves to l2_1.)

5. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1. (p1 is in l2_1 from step 3.)

6. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2. Now t2 is in l2_4 with p1.

7. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4. (Now p1 is in l2_4.)

But we need p1 to be in t2 while p2 is in l2_4. So maybe instead of unloading p1, we keep it in t2. Then:

After step 6 (t2 in l2_4 with p1):

7. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4. (But p2 needs to be in l2_4. How?)

Alternatively, after p2 is loaded into t2 in l2_1:

a. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.

b. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2. Now t2 is in l2_4 with both p1 and p2.

c. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4. (Now p1 is there.)

d. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4. (Now p2 is there, meeting constraint 7.)

But in step b, while t2 is in l2_4 carrying both p1 and p2, constraint 8 would be met if in some state, p2 is in l2_4 and p1 is in t2. So during step b (before unloading), p2 is in t2 (which is in l2_4), but p1 is also in t2. So in that state, p2 is in t2 (not in l2_4), so that doesn't satisfy constraint 8. Hmm. So perhaps after unloading p1, but before unloading p2:

After step b:

c. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4. Now p1 is in l2_4, p2 is still in t2 (which is in l2_4). So in this state, p2 is in t2 (not in l2_4). So no. Then unload p2:

d. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4. Now p2 is in l2_4. So in this state, both p1 and p2 are in l2_4 (constraint 7). But constraint 8 requires p2 in l2_4 and p1 in t2. So perhaps during the transportation, before unloading p1, when t2 is in l2_4 with both packages. Wait, but that would require p2 to be in t2 and in l2_4 at the same time, which isn't possible. So maybe this approach doesn't work. Alternative idea: Have p1 in t2 (loaded) and p2 in l2_4. How? If p2 is unloaded into l2_4, and p1 is still in t2. For example:

After step 6 (t2 in l2_4 with p1 and p2):

unload p2 first, then p1 is still in t2.

But that would require:

c. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4. Now p2 is in l2_4, and p1 is still in t2. So in this state, p2 is in l2_4 and p1 is in t2 (which is in l2_4). So constraint 8 is met. Then unload p1:

d. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4. Now p1 is in l2_4. So constraint 7 is met in the next state.

This could work. So the steps would be:

For p1:

1. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1.

2. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1.

3. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1. (Now p1 in l2_1, satisfying future constraint 6.)

For p2:

4. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2.

5. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1.

6. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1. (constraint 2 met.)

7. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

8. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1.

9. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4. (constraint 3 met.)

10. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_4. Wait, but a1 is in l2_1. To load p2 into a1, a1 must be in l1_4? No, airplanes can only be at airports. So l1_1 is the airport in c1. So to load p2 into an airplane, need to be at an airport. So p2 is in l1_4. How to get it to l1_1 (airport) to load into a1. So:

10. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4.

11. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1.

12. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

13. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1. (But a1 is in l2_1. So need to fly a1 back to l1_1 first.)

14. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1.

15. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1.

16. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1.

17. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1. (constraint 5 met, and since p1 was in l2_1 earlier, constraint 6 satisfied.)

18. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1. (constraint 9 met.)

19. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1.

20. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2.

21. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.

22. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2.

23. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3. (p2's goal met.)

For p1, after being in l2_1 (step 3):

24. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2.

25. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1.

26. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2.

27. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4. (Now p1 is in l2_4. Need to get it back to c1. But the goal is l1_3. So how?)

To get p1 back to c1:

28. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_4. Wait, a2 is in l2_1. So need to fly a2 to l2_4? But l2_4 is not an airport. Airplanes can only fly to airports. So impossible. So this approach won't work. Thus, moving p1 to l2_4 via truck may not be feasible if it's not near an airport. So perhaps we need to adjust the plan.

Alternative approach: Use a different airplane to move p1 back. But a2 is in l2_1. So load p1 into a2 at l2_1, fly to l1_1.

So after step 3 (p1 in l2_1):

4. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1.

5. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

6. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1. Now p1 is back in l1_1. Then, use truck t1 to move to l1_3.

But this way, p1's path is:

l1_1 -> l2_1 (via a1) -> l1_1 (via a2) -> l1_3 (via truck t1).

But during this, we need to satisfy the constraint that p1 is in l1_4. So after returning to l1_1, load p1 into truck t1, drive to l1_4, unload, then drive to l1_3.

So steps for p1 after step 6:

7. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1. (t1 is in l1_1 after step 5.)

Wait, no. After step 5, t1 was used to move p2. Let's track the truck movements.

In steps 4-23, truck t1 was used to move p2 from l1_2 to l1_1, then to l1_4, then back to l1_1. So after step 12, t1 is in l1_1. Then, after step 6, p1 is back in l1_1 via airplane. So step 7 would be:

7. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1.

8. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1.

9. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4. (constraint 1 met.)

10. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1.

11. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3. (goal met.)

This way, p1 is in l1_3.

Now, let's check all constraints:

1. p1 in l1_4: step 9.

2. p2 in l1_1: step 6.

3. after p2 is in l1_1 (step6), p2 is moved to l1_4 (step9), so constraint3 is satisfied.

4. p1 in l1_1: step6 (unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1), which satisfies constraint4.

5. p2 in l2_1: step17.

6. when p2 is in l2_1 (step17), p1 was there in step3.

7. both p1 and p2 in l2_4: need to arrange this. But in current steps, p1 is in l2_4 (step9?), wait no: p1 is in l1_4 (step9), which is in c1. So this approach doesn't satisfy constraint7. So need to find a way to get both p1 and p2 to l2_4.

Hmm, this is a problem. Let's think again.

To meet constraint7: both p1 and p2 must be in l2_4. So how to get p1 there. Maybe after p1 is in l2_1 (step3), use truck t2 (in c2) to move it to l2_4.

Steps:

3. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1.

4. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2.

5. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1.

6. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2.

7. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4. Now p1 in l2_4.

For p2 to be in l2_4:

After step17 (p2 in l2_1):

18. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1. (t2 is in l2_1 after step4.)

19. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2.

20. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4. Now p2 is in l2_4. So in step20, both p1 and p2 are in l2_4 (constraint7 met).

But p1 was unloaded in step7, so in step20, p1 is in l2_4. So this works.

Now, constraint8: p2 in l2_4 and p1 in t2. So during transportation, when t2 is carrying p1 to l2_4 (steps5-6), before unloading, p1 is in t2. So if during that time, p2 is also in l2_4, but that's not the case. Alternatively, after p2 is loaded into t2 (step18), when t2 is driven to l2_4 with both p1 and p2. But in step6, p1 is unloaded, so that doesn't help. Hmm. So perhaps during step19, when t2 is in l2_4 carrying p2, and p1 is already in l2_4. Then, in the state after step7 (p1 in l2_4), and step19 (t2 in l2_4 with p2), then constraint8 isn't met. We need a state where p2 is in l2_4 and p1 is in t2. So perhaps during step6, after driving to l2_4 but before unloading p1:

- t2 is in l2_4 with p1. So p1 is in t2. If p2 is also in l2_4 at that time, but p2 is in l1_4 (step9). So that's not possible. Hmm. This suggests that constraint8 is not met with current steps.

To satisfy constraint8, perhaps:

After step5 (p1 loaded into t2), drive t2 to l2_4 (step6), but keep p1 in t2. Then, in step20, when p2 is unloaded in l2_4, p1 is still in t2. So:

6. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2. (t2 is in l2_4 with p1.)

7. ... other steps ...

Then, after moving p2 to l2_4:

20. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4. Now p2 is in l2_4, and p1 is still in t2 (since not unloaded). So in this state, p2 is in l2_4 and p1 is in t2 (constraint8 met). Then, after that, unload p1:

21. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4. Now both are in l2_4 (constraint7).

So this would work. But this requires keeping p1 in t2 until after p2 is unloaded. Let's adjust the steps:

For p1:

1. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1.

2. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1.

3. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1.

4. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2.

5. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1.

6. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2. (p1 is in t2 at l2_4.)

For p2:

... steps to get p2 to l2_1 ...

17. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1.

18. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1. (t2 is in l2_4? No, after step6, t2 is in l2_4. Wait, no: step6 is part of p1's steps. So after step6, t2 is in l2_4. So how to load p2 into t2? Because p2 is in l2_1, and t2 is in l2_4. So need to drive t2 back to l2_1.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let's outline:

After step6 (t2 in l2_4 with p1), to load p2 into t2, we need t2 to be in l2_1. So:

7. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2. (Drive back to l2_1.)

8. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.

9. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2. (Now t2 is in l2_4 with both p1 and p2.)

10. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4. (Now p2 in l2_4, p1 still in t2. So constraint8 is met.)

11. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4. (Now both in l2_4, constraint7 met.)

This adds steps but satisfies constraints 7 and8.

Now, integrating all these steps, the plan is getting quite long. Let's try to compile all the steps in order.

Final Steps:

For p1:

1. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1.

2. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1.

3. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1. (p1 in l2_1, satisfies constraint6's precondition.)

4. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2. (move t2 to l2_1.)

5. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1. 

6. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2. (p1 in t2 at l2_4.)

For p2:

7. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2.

8. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1.

9. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1. (p2 in l1_1, constraint2 met.)

10. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

11. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1.

12. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4. (p2 in l1_4, constraint3 met.)

13. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4.

14. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1.

15. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

16. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1. (a1 returns to l1_1.)

17. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1.

18. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1.

19. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1. (p2 in l2_1, constraint5 met. Also, constraint6 is satisfied since p1 was in l2_1 earlier.)

20. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1. (p2 in a2, constraint9 met.)

21. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1. (p2 back in l2_1.)

22. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2. (t2 returns to l2_1 to pick up p2.)

23. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.

24. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2. (t2 in l2_4 with p1 and p2.)

25. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4. (p2 in l2_4, p1 still in t2: constraint8 met.)

26. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4. (p1 in l2_4, constraint7 met.)

Now, to get p1 back to c1's l1_3:

27. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_4. (But a2 is in l2_1. So need to fly a2 to l2_4? No, airports only. So this is impossible. Alternative: fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1, then load p1 from l2_4 into a different airplane. But how?

Alternatively, after step26, p1 is in l2_4 (c2). To get to l1_3 (c1), need to use airplane.

So:

27. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2. (drive t2 back to l2_1.)

28. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1. (a2 is in l2_1.)

29. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

30. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1.

31. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1. (t1 is in l1_1.)

32. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1.

33. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4. (constraint1 met again.)

34. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4.

35. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1.

36. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3. (goal met.)

For p2, after step26, p2 is in l2_4. To reach l2_3:

37. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4.

38. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2.

39. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3. (goal met.)

This is a very long plan. But we need to check if all constraints are met:

- constraint1: p1 in l1_4 (step33).

- constraint2: p2 in l1_1 (step9).

- constraint3: after step9, p2 is moved to l1_4 (step12).

- constraint4: p1 in l1_1 (step30).

- constraint5: p2 in l2_1 (step19).

- constraint6: p2 in l2_1 (step19) requires p1 in l2_1 earlier (step3).

- constraint7: p1 and p2 in l2_4 (step26 and 25).

- constraint8: p2 in l2_4 and p1 in t2 (step25 before unloading p2).

- constraint9: p2 in a2 (step20).

Now, check the constraints' conditional requirements:

- If p2 is in l1_1 (step9), then after that, either p1 in l1_5 or p2 in l1_4. In step12, p2 is moved to l1_4, which satisfies this.

- If p1 is in l1_1 (step30), then after that, p2 is in l1_2 or p1 in l2_4. After step30, p2 is in l2_1 (step19), then l2_4. So neither. But wait, after step30, p1 is in l1_1, and later steps move it to l1_4 and l1_3. So in step30, after p1 is in l1_1, the condition is that either p2 is in l1_2 or p1 is in l2_4. In step30, p2 is in l2_1. Then, later, p1 is moved to l2_4 (step26). So after step30, in step26, p1 is in l2_4, which satisfies the condition. So the constraint is met.

This seems to cover all constraints. However, the plan is quite long. Maybe there's a shorter way. For example, when moving p2 from l1_4 to l1_1, maybe use an airplane directly from l1_4, but since l1_4 is not an airport, that's impossible. So the steps seem necessary.

Now, let's write the plan in order, ensuring that each action's preconditions are met. Also, ensuring that the sequence is correct.

But considering time, perhaps this is the optimal plan given the constraints. However, there might be a shorter way. Let's try to find a more optimal sequence.

Alternative idea: Combine steps where possible. For example, when moving t2 to l2_1, use it for multiple purposes.

But given time constraints, I'll proceed with the outlined steps, ensuring each action is valid.
