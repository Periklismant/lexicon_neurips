Alright, let's start by understanding the problem:

We have two cities (c1 and c2) with multiple locations each, including one airport in each city (l1_1 in c1 and l2_1 in c2).
We have two packages (p1 and p2), two trucks (t1 and t2), and two airplanes (a1 and a2).
The goal is to bring p1 to l2_1 (an airport in c2) and p2 to l1_3 (a location in c1).

There are also numerous constraints that our plan must satisfy.

First, let's analyze the initial state:

- Location l1_1 through l1_5 are in city c1, with l1_1 being an airport.
- Location l2_1 through l2_5 are in city c2, with l2_1 being an airport.
- We have t1 in l1_2 (a location in c1).
- We have t2 in l2_4 (a location in c2).
- p1 and p2, the packages, are both in l1_4 (a location in c1).
- a1, an airplane, is in l1_1 (the airport in c1).
- a2, another airplane, is in l2_1 (the airport in c2).

Hmm, wait, there seems to be a discrepancy in the initial state:
"Package t1 is in location l1_2"
"Package t2 is in location l2_4"
"Package a1 is in location l1_1"
"Package a2 is in location l2_1"

t1, t2, a1, and a2 are not packages, but trucks and airplanes. Let me assume the correct interpretation:

- Truck t1 is in location l1_2 (a location in c1).
- Truck t2 is in location l2_4 (a location in c2).
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (the airport in c1).
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1 (the airport in c2).

Now, let's think about how to create a plan that achieves the goal while satisfying all the constraints:

At a high level, we need to:
1. Bring p1 to l2_1 (an airport in c2).
2. Bring p2 to l1_3 (a location in c1).

Now, let's consider the constraints:

1. p2 must be in t2 at some point.
2. p1 must be in l1_1 (the airport in c1) at some point.
3. If p1 is in l1_1, then p2 must have been in l2_4.
4. p1 must be in l1_4 at some point.
5. If p1 is in l1_4, then p2 must be in l2_1 (the airport in c2) at that time or a later time.
6. p2 must be in t2 or l1_5 at some point.
7. p2 must be in l1_3 at some point.
8. If p2 is in l1_3, then p2 must have been in l2_4 or p1 in l1_2 earlier.
9. p1 must be in a2 or p2 in a1 at some point.
10. p1 and p2 must both be in a2 at some point.

Ok, I see. We have to plan this carefully to respect all constraints.

Let me start by sketching a high-level plan:

1. Initially, both p1 and p2 are in l1_4, a location in c1. We need to move them to different places.
2. Constraint 3 suggests p2 should be in l2_4 before p1 is in l1_1. Constraint 8 suggests we need either p2 in l2_4 or p1 in l1_2 before p2 is in l1_3.

Let's try to create a plan step by step, ensuring each constraint is met. Note that constraint 10 requires both p1 and p2 to be in a2 at the same time. So, we need to bring them both to a2 at some point. 

Here's an initial sketch of the plan:

1. Move p1 and p2 from l1_4 using t1 and/or t2.
2. Transport p2 to l2_4 using trucks and airplanes. (This satisfies constraint 3 partially and constraint 8 partially.)
3. Transport p1 to l1_1. (Now constraint 3 is fully satisfied.)
4. Transport p1 to a2 and p2 to a2. (This satisfies constraint 10.)
5. Transport p1 to l2_1 (goal) and p2 to l1_3 (goal).

Let's refine this further:

Initial state:
- p1 is in l1_4 (a location in c1).
- p2 is in l1_4 (a location in c1).
- t1 is in l1_2 (a location in c1).
- t2 is in l2_4 (a location in c2).
- a1 is in l1_1 (the airport in c1).
- a2 is in l2_1 (the airport in c2).

Step 1: Transport p1 and p2 from l1_4 using t1. This satisfies constraint 4 (p1 is initially in l1_4).
- Move t1 from l1_2 to l1_4.
- Load p1 onto t1 at l1_4.
- Load p2 onto t1 at l1_4.

Step 2: Transport p2 to l2_4 using t1, a1, and t2. This satisfies part of constraint 3 and 8.
- Move t1 from l1_4 to l1_1 (the airport in c1).
- Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1.
- Load p2 onto a1 at l1_1. (This satisfies part of constraint 9 if we consider it as "p2 is in a1".)
- Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
- Unload p2 from a1 at l2_1. (This satisfies constraint 5 partially as p2 is now in l2_1.)
- Move t2a from l2_4 to l2_1.
- Load p2 onto t2 at l2_1. (This satisfies constraint 1 as p2 is now in t2, and constraint 6 as p2 is in t2.)
- Move t2 from l2_1 to l2_4.
- Unload p2 from t2 at l2_4. (Now p2 is in l2_4, fully satisfying constraint 3 and 8 partially.)

Step 3: Transport p1 to l1_1. This satisfies constraint 2.
- Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1. (This satisfies constraint 2 as p1 is now in l1_1. And since p2 was in l2_4, constraint 3 is fully satisfied.)

Step 4: Transport p1 to a2 and p2 to a2. This satisfies constraint 10.
- Load p1 onto a1 at l1_1.
- Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
- Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1.
- Move t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
- Load p2 onto t2 at l2_4.
- Move t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
- Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1.
- Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1. (This satisfies part of constraint 9 if we consider it as "p1 is in a2".)
- Load p2 onto a2 at l2_1. (This satisfies constraint 10 as both p1 and p2 are now in a2.)

Step 5: Transport p1 to l2_1 (goal) and p2 to l1_3 (goal).
- Unload p1 from a2 at l2_1. (Now p1 is in l2_1, satisfying the first part of the goal.)
- Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
- Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1.
- Move t1 from l1_1 to l1_3.
- Load p2 onto t1 at l1_1.
- Move t1 from l1_1 to l1_3.
- Unload p2 from t1 at l1_3. (Now p2 is in l1_3, satisfying the second part of the goal and constraint 7.)

Wait, I'm a bit confused with Step 4. Let me revisit that:

Step 4: Transport p1 to a2 and p2 to a2. This is to satisfy constraint 10.
- Load p1 onto a1 at l1_1.
- Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
- Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1.
- Load p2 onto t2 at l2_4.
- Move t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
- Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1.
- Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1. (This satisfies part of constraint 9 if we consider it as "p1 is in a2".)
- Load p2 onto a2 at l2_1. (This satisfies constraint 10 as both p1 and p2 are now in a2.)

Hmm, OK, I'm a bit scattered in my thoughts. Let's be more systematic. I'll trace through the entire plan, ensuring every constraint is met.

Let's start from the initial state and work out the plan step by step:

Initial state:
- p1 is in l1_4 (a location in c1).
- p2 is in l1_4 (a location in c1).
- t1 is in l1_2 (a location in c1).
- t2 is in l2_4 (a location in c2).
- a1, an airplane, is in l1_1 (the airport in c1).
- a2, another airplane, is in l2_1 (the airport in c2).

I'll try a different approach:

Constraint 5 states that if p1 is in l1_4, then p2 must be in l2_1 at that time or a later time. Since p1 is initially in l1_4, we need to get p2 to l2_1 at some point. Constraint 10 states that both p1 and p2 must be in a2 at the same time, and a2 is initially at l2_1. So, we need to get both packages to l2_1 at some point. Constraint 3 states that if p1 is in l1_1, then p2 must have been in l2_4. Constraint 8 states that if p2 is in l1_3, then p2 must have been in l2_4 or p1 must have been in l1_2.

I'm going to build the plan based on these constraints:

1. Move t1 from l1_2 to l1_4.
2. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_4.
3. Move t1 from l1_4 to l1_1.
4. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1.
5. Load p2 onto a1 at l1_1. (This satisfies part of constraint 9 if we consider it as "p2 is in a1".)
6. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
7. Unload p2 from a1 at l2_1. (This satisfies constraint 5 as p2 is now in l2_1 and p1 was in l1_4.)
8. Move t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
9. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_1. (This satisfies constraint 1 as p2 is now in t2, and part of constraint 6.)
10. Move t2 from l2_1 to l2_4.
11. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_4. (Now p2 is in l2_4, satisfying part of constraint 3 and 8.)
12. Move t1 from l1_1 to l1_4.
13. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_4.
14. Move t1 from l1_4 to l1_2.
15. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_2. (This satisfies part of constraint 8 as p1 is now in l1_2.)
16. Move t1 from l1_2 to l1_1.
17. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_2.
18. Move t1 from l1_2 to l1_1.
19. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1. (This satisfies constraint 2 as p1 is now in l1_1. And since p2 was in l2_4, constraint 3 is fully satisfied.)
20. Load p1 onto a1 at l1_1.
21. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
22. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1.
23. Move t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
24. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_4.
25. Move t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
26. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1.
27. Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1. (This satisfies part of constraint 9 if we consider it as "p1 is in a2".)
28. Load p2 onto a2 at l2_1. (This satisfies constraint 10 as both p1 and p2 are now in a2.)
29. Unload p1 from a2 at l2_1. (Now p1 is in l2_1, satisfying the first part of the goal.)
30. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
31. Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1.
32. Move t1 from l1_1 to l1_5.
33. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_1.
34. Move t1 from l1_1 to l1_5.
35. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_5. (This satisfies the other part of constraint 6 as p2 is now in l1_5.)
36. Move t1 from l1_5 to l1_3.
37. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_5.
38. Move t1 from l1_5 to l1_3.
39. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_3. (Now p2 is in l1_3, satisfying the second part of the goal and constraint 7. Since p1 was in l1_2, constraint 8 is fully satisfied.)

One issue I see is that I'm moving t1 multiple times and taking roundabout routes. Let me simplify and optimize:

1. Move t1 from l1_2 to l1_4.
2. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_4. (Constraint 4: p1 is in l1_4. Now we need to eventually satisfy Constraint 5.)
3. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_4.
4. Move t1 from l1_4 to l1_1.
5. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1. (Constraint
2: p1 is in l1_1. We need to have p2 in l2_4 before this to satisfy Constraint 3.)
6. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1.
7. Load p2 onto a1 at l1_1. (Constraint 9: p2 is in a1.)
8. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
9. Unload p2 from a1 at l2_1. (Constraint 5: p2 is in l2_1 after p1 was in l1_4.)
10. Move t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
11. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_1. (Constraint 1: p2 is in t2.)
12. Move t2 from l2_1 to l2_4.
13. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_4. (Here, p2 is in l2_4 before p1 was in l1_1, satisfying Constraint 3 and part of Constraint 8.)
14. Load p1 onto a1 at l1_1.
15. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
16. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1.
17. Move t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
18. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_4.
19. Move t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
20. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1.
21. Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1. (Constraint 9: p1 is in a2.)
22. Load p2 onto a2 at l2_1. (Constraint 10: both p1 and p2 are in a2.)
23. Unload p1 from a2 at l2_1. (Goal: p1 is in l2_1.)
24. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
25. Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1.
26. Move t1 from l1_1 to l1_5.
27. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_1.
28. Move t1 from l1_1 to l1_5.
29. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_5. (Constraint 6: p2 is in l1_5.)
30. Move t1 from l1_5 to l1_3.
31. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_5.
32. Move t1 from l1_5 to l1_3.
33. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_3. (Goal: p2 is in l1_3. Constraint 7: p2 is in l1_3. Since p2 was in l2_4, Constraint 8 is fully satisfied.)

Wait, this is still a bit convoluted. Let's simplify again. I think it will help if I draw the transportation network first.

In city c1:
- l1_1 (airport), l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5

In city c2:
- l2_1 (airport), l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5

Initially:
- p1 and p2 are in l1_4 (in city c1)
- t1 is in l1_2 (in city c1)
- t2 is in l2_4 (in city c2)
- a1 is in l1_1 (airport in c1)
- a2 is in l2_1 (airport in c2)

Goal:
- p1 is in l2_1 (airport in c2)
- p2 is in l1_3 (in city c1)

Reviewing the constraints, I think a simpler plan is:

1. Move t1 from l1_2 to l1_4.
2. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_4. (Constraint 4: p1 is in l1_4.)
3. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_4.
4. Move t1 from l1_4 to l1_1.
5. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1.
6. Load p2 onto a1 at l1_1. (Constraint 9: p2 is in a1.)
7. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
8. Unload p2 from a1 at l2_1. (Constraint 5: p2 is in l2_1 after p1 was in l1_4.)
9. Move t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
10. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_1. (Constraint 1 and 6: p2 is in t2.)
11. Move t2 from l2_1 to l2_4.
12. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_4. (Constraint part 8: p2 is in l2_4.)
13. Move t1 from l1_1 to l1_2.
14. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_2. (Constraint 8: p1 is in l1_2.)
15. Move t1 from l1_2 to l1_1.
16. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_2.
17. Move t1 from l1_2 to l1_1.
18. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1. (Constraint 2: p1 is in l1_1. Constraint 3: p2 was in l2_4 before p1 is in l1_1.)
19. Load p1 onto a1 at l1_1.
20. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
21. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1.
22. Move t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
23. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_4.
24. Move t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
25. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1.
26. Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1. (Constraint 9: p1 is in a2.)
27. Load p2 onto a2 at l2_1. (Constraint 10: both p1 and p2 are in a2.)
28. Unload p1 from a2 at l2_1. (First goal achieved: p1 is in l2_1.)
29. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
30. Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1.
31. Move t1 from l1_1 to l1_3.
32. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_1.
33. Move t1 from l1_1 to l1_3.
34. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_3. (Second goal achieved: p2 is in l1_3. Constraint 7: p2 is in l1_3.)

OK, I think I'm getting too overelaborate. Let me simplify and try a clean, concise plan.

1. Move t1 from l1_2 to l1_4.
2. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_4. (Constraint 4: p1 is in l1_4.)
3. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_4.
4. Move t1 from l1_4 to l1_1.
5. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1.
6. Load p2 onto a1 at l1_1. (Constraint 9: p2 is in a1.)
7. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
8. Unload p2 from a1 at l2_1. (Constraint 5: p2 is in l2_1 after p1 was in l1_4.)
9. Move t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
10. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_1. (Constraint 1 and 6: p2 is in t2.)
11. Move t2 from l2_1 to l2_4.
12. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_4. (Constraint part 8: p2 is in l2_4.)
13. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1. (Constraint 2: p1 is in l1_1. Constraint 3: p2 was in l2_4 before p1 is in l1_1.)
14. Load p1 onto a1 at l1_1.
15. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
16. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1.
17. Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1. (Constraint 9: p1 is in a2.)
18. Move t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
19. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_4.
20. Move t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
21. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1.
22. Load p2 onto a2 at l2_1. (Constraint 10: both p1 and p2 are in a2.)
23. Unload p1 from a2 at l2_1. (First goal achieved: p1 is in l2_1.)
24. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
25. Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1.
26. Move t1 from l1_1 to l1_5.
27. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_1.
28. Move t1 from l1_1 to l1_5.
29. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_5. (Constraint 6: p2 is in l1_5.)
30. Move t1 from l1_5 to l1_3.
31. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_5.
32. Move t1 from l1_5 to l1_3.
33. Unload p2 from t1, at l1_3. (Second goal achieved: p2 is in l1_3. Constraint 7: p2 is in l1_3. Constraint 8: p2 was in l2_4 before p2 is in l1_3.)

Hmm, I'm still having some issues with consistency. I'm also not 100% sure I'm interpreting the constraints correctly. Let me take another approach. I'll start from the high-level constraints and build the plan accordingly.

From the constraints, I deduce:

1. p1 must be in l1_4 at some point. (Constraint 4) This is already satisfied in the initial state.
2. If p1 is in l1_4, then p2 must be in l2_1 at that time or later. (Constraint 5) Since p1 is initially in l1_4, we need to move p2 to l2_1.
3. p1 must be in l1_1 at some point. (Constraint 2)
4. If p1 is in l1_1, then p2 must have been in l2_4 earlier. (Constraint 3)
5. p2 must be in t2 at some point OR p2 must be in l1_5 at some point. (Constraint 6)
6. p2 must be in l1_3 at some point. (Constraint 7) This is part of the goal.
7. If p2 is in l1_3, then p2 must have been in l2_4 earlier OR p1 must have been in l1_2 earlier. (Constraint 8)
8. p1 must be in a2 at some point OR p2 must be in a1 at some point. (Constraint 9)
9. p1 and p2 must both be in a2 at the same time. (Constraint 10)

And the goal is:
- p1 is in l2_1.
- p2 is in l1_3.

Let's design the plan linearly with these constraints in mind:

1. Move t1 from l1_2 to l1_4.
2. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_4.
3. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_4.
4. Move t1 from l1_4 to l1_1 (airport in c1).
5. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1.
6. Load p2 onto a1 at l1_1. (Constraint 9 satisfied: p2 is in a1.)
7. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1 (airport in c2).
8. Unload p2 from a1 at l2_1. (Constraint 5 satisfied: p2 is in l2_1 after p1 was in l1_4.)
9. Move t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
10. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_1. (Constraint 1 and 6 partially satisfied: p2 is in t2.)
11. Move t2 from l2_1 to l2_4.
12. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_4. (Constraint 3 partially satisfied and constraint 8 partially satisfied: p2 is in l2_4.)
13. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1. (Constraint 2 satisfied: p1 is in l1_1. Constraint 3 is fully satisfied because p2 was in l2_4 before p1 is in l1_1.)
14. Load p1 onto a1 at l1_1.
15. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
16. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1.
17. Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1. (Constraint 9 fully satisfied: p1 is in a2.)
18. Move t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
19. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_4.
20. Move t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
21. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1.
22. Load p2 onto a2 at l2_1. (Constraint 10 satisfied: both p1 and p2 are in a2.)
23. Unload p1 from a2 at l2_1. (First goal achieved: p1 is in l2_1.)
24. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
25. Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1.
26. Move t1 from l1_1 to l1_5.
27. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_1.
28. Move t1 from l1_1 to l1_5.
29. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_5. (Constraint 6 fully satisfied: p2 is in l1_5.)
30. Move t1 from l1_5 to l1_3.
31. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_5.
32. Move t1 from l1_5 to l1_3.
33. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_3. (Second goal achieved: p2 is in l1_3. Constraint 7 satisfied: p2 is in l1_3. Constraint 8 is fully satisfied because p2 was in l2_4 before p2 is in l1_3.)

Wait, there's a redundancy in the plan. Let's simplify:

1. Move t1 from l1_2 to l1_4.
2. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_4.
3. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_4.
4. Move t1 from l1_4 to l1_1 (airport in c1).
5. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1.
6. Load p2 onto a1 at l1_1. (Constraint 9 satisfied: p2 is in a1.)
7. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1 (airport in c2).
8. Unload p2 from a1 at l2_1. (Constraint 5 satisfied: p2 is in l2_1 after p1 was in l1_4.)
9. Move t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
10. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_1. (Constraint 1 and 6 partially satisfied: p2 is in t2.)
11. Move t2 from l2_1 to l2_4.
12. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_4. (Constraint 3 partially satisfied and constraint 8 partially satisfied: p2 is in l2_4.)
13. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1. (Constraint 2 satisfied: p1 is in l1_1. Constraint 3 is fully satisfied because p2 was in l2_4 before p1 is in l1_1.)
14. Load p1 onto a1 at l1_1.
15. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
16. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1.
17. Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1. (Constraint 9 fully satisfied: p1 is in a2.)
18. Move t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
19. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_4.
20. Move t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
21. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1.
22. Load p2 onto a2 at l2_1. (Constraint 10 satisfied: both p1 and p2 are in a2.)
23. Unload p1 from a2 at l2_1. (First goal achieved: p1 is in l2_1.)
24. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
25. Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1.
26. Move t1 from l1_1 to l1_5.
27. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_1.
28. Move t1 from l1_1 to l1_5.
29. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_5. (Constraint 6 fully satisfied: p2 is in l1_5.)
30. Move t1 from l1_5 to l1_3.
31. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_5.
32. Move t1 from l1_5 to l1_3.
33. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_3. (Second goal achieved: p2 is in l1_3. Constraint 7 satisfied: p2 is in l1_3. Constraint 8 is fully satisfied because p2 was in l2_4 before p2 is in l1_3.)

I'm still repeating some steps. Let me rethink this.

Ok, let me just focus on creating a valid plan, ensuring all constraints are met:

1. Move t1 from l1_2 to l1_4.
2. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_4.
3. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_4.
4. Move t1 from l1_4 to l1_1.
5. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1.
6. Load p2 onto a1 at l1_1. (Constraint 9 satisfied: p2 is in a1.)
7. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
8. Unload p2 from a1 at l2_1. (Constraint 5 satisfied: p2 is in l2_1 after p1 was in l1_4.)
9. Move t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
10. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_1. (Constraint 1 and 6 partially satisfied: p2 is in t2.)
11. Move t2 from l2_1 to l2_4.
12. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_4. (Constraint 3 partially satisfied and constraint 8 partially satisfied: p2 is in l2_4.)
13. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1. (Constraint 2 satisfied: p1 is in l1_1. Constraint 3 is fully satisfied because p2 was in l2_4 before p1 is in l1_1.)
14. Load p1 onto a1 at l1_1.
15. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
16. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1.
17. Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1. (Constraint 9 fully satisfied: p1 is in a2.)
18. Move t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
19. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_4.
20. Move t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
21. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1.
22. Load p2 onto a2 at l2_1. (Constraint 10 satisfied: both p1 and p2 are in a2.)
23. Unload p1 from a2 at l2_1. (First goal achieved: p1 is in l2_1.)
24. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
25. Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1.
26. Move t1 from l1_1 to l1_3.
27. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_1.
28. Move t1 from l1_1 to l1_3.
29. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_3. (Second goal achieved: p2 is in l1_3. Constraint 7 satisfied: p2 is in l1_3. Constraint 8 is fully satisfied because p2 was in l2_4 before p2 is in l1_3.)

OK, but wait. I need to move t2 twice from l2_4 to l2_1 (step 9 and 18), which seems inefficient. Let me simplify this plan to make it more optimal.

Let's see if I can avoid these redundancies:

1. Move t1 from l1_2 to l1_4.
2. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_4.
3. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_4.
4. Move t1 from l1_4 to l1_1.
5. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1.
6. Load p2 onto a1 at l1_1. (Constraint 9 partially satisfied: p2 is in a1.)
7. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
8. Unload p2 from a1 at l2_1. (Constraint 5 satisfied: p2 is in l2_1 after p1 was in l1_4.)
9. Move t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
10. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_1. (Constraint 1 and 6 partially satisfied: p2 is in t2.)
11. Move t2 from l2_1 to l2_4.
12. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_4. (Constraint 3 partially and constraint 8 partially satisfied: p2 is in l2_4.)
13. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1. (Constraint 2 satisfied: p1 is in l1_1. Constraint 3 is fully satisfied because p2 was in l2_4 before p1 is in l1_1.)
14. Load p1 onto a1 at l1_1.
15. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
16. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1.
17. Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1. (Constraint 9 fully satisfied: p1 is in a2.)
18. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_4.
19. Move t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
20. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1.
21. Load p2 onto a2 at l2_1. (Constraint 10 satisfied: both p1 and p2 are in a2.)
22. Unload p1 from a2 at l2_1. (First goal achieved: p1 is in l2_1.)
23. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
24. Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1.
25. Move t1 from l1_1 to l1_5.
26. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_1.
27. Move t1 from l1_1 to l1_5.
28. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_5. (Constraint 6 fully satisfied: p2 is in l1_5.)
29. Move t1 from l1_5 to l1_3.
30. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_5.
31. Move t1 from l1_5 to l1_3.
32. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_3. (Second goal achieved: p2 is in l1_3. Constraint 7 satisfied: p2 is in l1_3. Constraint 8 is fully satisfied because p2 was in l2_4 before p2 is in l1_3.)

OK, I think this plan works. However, I'm still not sure if I've interpreted constraint 5 correctly. Let me double-check:

Constraint 5: "If expression 'Package p1 is in location l1_4' holds in some state s, then expression 'Package p2 is in location l2_1' must hold at s or at some state after s."

In the initial state, p1 is in l1_4. Therefore, p2 must be in l2_1 at the initial state or at some later state. In our plan, p2 is in l2_1 at step 8, which satisfies this constraint.

Constraint 3: "If expression 'Package p1 is in location l1_1' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'Package p2 is in location l2_4'"

In our plan, p1 is in l1_1 at step 13, and p2 is in l2_4 at step 12, which satisfies this constraint.

Constraint 8: "If expression 'Package p2 is in location l1_3' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'At least one of the following conditions is true: 'Package p2 is in location l2_4', 'Package p1 is in location l1_2'"

In our plan, p2 is in l1_3 at step 32, and p2 is in l2_4 at step 12, which satisfies this constraint.

Great, the plan is valid. Let me clarify the final plan:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
3. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
4. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
5. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
6. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
7. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
8. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
9. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
10. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
11. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
12. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
13. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
14. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
15. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
16. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
17. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
18. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
19. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
20. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
21. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
22. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
23. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
24. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
25. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
26. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
27. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
28. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
29. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1
30. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

However, I feel there's still room for improvement. Let's see if we can trim some redundancies (like steps 26-28) and optimize further.

Simplified plan:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
3. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
4. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
5. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
6. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
7. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
8. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
9. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
10. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
11. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
12. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
13. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
14. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
15. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
16. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
17. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
18. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
19. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
20. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
21. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
22. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
23. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
24. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
25. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
26. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
27. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
28. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
29. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1
30. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

Hang on, I just noticed the the problem statement says "Delineate the plan with one top line and one bottom line containing only 3  '`' characters." I'll add these to my final plan. Also, I want to make sure I'm using actions in the correct format.

Ah, wait. I just found an issue with my plan. In step 6, I'm using "loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1" as the action for loading a package into an airplane, but the given action is "loadairplane p ap l". Let me double-check the action list.

Looking at the available actions, I see that "loadairplane" is used both for loading and unloading a package from an airplane, which seems confusing. However, when reviewing the list of actions and effects in detail, I see that actions 1-4 in my list are:
"loadtruck p t l"
"loadairplane p ap l"
"unloadtruck p t l"
"loadairplane p ap l"

But it's listed as "unloadairplane p ap l" in the effects section. So, I'm going to assume the correct action for unloading a package from an airplane is "unloadairplane p ap l". Let me correct my plan:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
3. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
4. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
5. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
6. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
7. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
8. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
9. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
10. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
11. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
12. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
13. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
14. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
15. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
16. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
17. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
18. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
19. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
20. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
21. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
22. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
23. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
24. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
25. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
26. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
27. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
28. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
29. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1
30. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

Let me double-check the constraints before finalizing:

Constraint 1: p2 must be in t2 at some point. Satisfied at step 10 and 18.
Constraint 2: p1 must be in l1_1 at some point. Satisfied at step 13.
Constraint 3: If p1 is in l1_1, then p2 must have been in l2_4 earlier. Satisfied as p1 is in l1_1 at step 13 and p2 is in l2_4 at step 12.
Constraint 4: p1 must be in l1_4 at some point. Satisfied at the initial state.
Constraint 5: If p1 is in l1_4, then p2 must be in l2_1 at that time or later. Satisfied as p1 is in l1_4 at the initial state and p2 is in l2_1 at step 8.
Constraint 6: p2 must be in t2 OR p2 must be in l1_5 at some point. Satisfied at step 10, 18 (p2 in t2) and step 27 (p2 in l1_5).
Constraint 7: p2 must be in l1_3 at some point. Satisfied at step 30.
Constraint 8: If p2 is in l1_3, then p2 must have been in l2_4 earlier OR p1 must have been in l1_2 earlier. Satisfied as p2 is in l1_3 at step 30 and p2 is in l2_4 at step 12.
Constraint 9: p1 must be in a2 OR p2 must be in a1 at some point. Satisfied at step 17 (p1 in a2) and step 6 (p2 in a1).
Constraint 10: p1 and p2 must both be in a2 at the same time. Satisfied at step 17-21 where both p1 and p2 are in a2.

All constraints are met, and the resulting state is:
p1 is in l2_1 (goal)
p2 is in l1_3 (goal)

Actually, one thing to note, we are "loading" p2 onto t1 at step 25, but I don't see us unloading it between steps 27 and 28. Let me fix this:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
3. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
4. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
5. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
6. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
7. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
8. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
9. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
10. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
11. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
12. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
13. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
14. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
15. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
16. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
17. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
18. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
19. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
20. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
21. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
22. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
23. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
24. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
25. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
26. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
27. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
28. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
29. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1
30. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

My plan is correct, and I've verified all constraints. Let me put my final answer in the format requested:
