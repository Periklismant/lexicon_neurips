Okay, let's try to solve this planning problem. Hmm, the goal is to get p1 to l2_1 (which is an airport in c2) and p2 to l1_3 in c1. There are a bunch of constraints to satisfy as well. Let me break this down step by step.

First, looking at the initial state. Packages p1 and p2 are both in l1_4, which is in city c1. Trucks t1 is in l1_2 and t2 is in l2_4. Airplanes a1 is at l1_1 (c1's airport) and a2 is at l2_1 (c2's airport). So, to move packages between cities, we probably need airplanes. But to get packages to airports, we need trucks.

Starting with p1: It needs to go from l1_4 (c1) to l2_1 (c2). So, maybe load p1 into a truck, drive it to the airport l1_1, load it onto airplane a1, fly a1 to l2_1, then unload. Wait, but the airplane a1 is already at l1_1. Wait, no: the initial state says "Package a1 is in location l1_1". Wait, wait, that's a typo, right? Because a1 is an airplane, not a package. Oh, wait, the original state says "Package a1 is in location l1_1". Wait, that can't be right. Wait, the user probably made a mistake here. Wait, looking back: the objects include "airplane a1" and "airplane a2". Then in the original state, the entries say "Package a1 is in location l1_1" and "Package a2 is in location l2_1". That's definitely a mistake. Airplanes are not packages. So this must be a typo. The correct initial state should be "Airplane a1 is in location l1_1" and "Airplane a2 is in location l2_1". Because otherwise, you can't fly airplanes if they're considered packages. So I think that's a mistake in the problem statement, but I have to work with what's given. Wait, but the problem says the original state includes "Package a1 is in location l1_1". That's conflicting. But according to the objects, a1 is an airplane. So maybe this is a mistake, but perhaps the user intended that a1 is an airplane located at l1_1. I'll have to proceed under that assumption, treating "Package a1" as a typo, and assume it's "Airplane a1 is in l1_1". Otherwise, the problem is impossible because you can't fly a package as an airplane.

Assuming that, then a1 is at l1_1 (c1's airport), a2 at l2_1 (c2's airport). So to move p1 from c1 to c2, we can use a1 to fly to l2_1. But first, we need to get p1 to l1_1. Since p1 is in l1_4, which is in c1, so we can use truck t1 (which is in l1_2) to drive to l1_4, load p1, drive to l1_1, unload, load onto a1, fly to l2_1, unload. Then p1 is at l2_1.

For p2, it needs to go to l1_3 in c1. Since p2 starts at l1_4, which is in c1. So maybe use truck t1 (same city) to move it. But truck t1 is in l1_2. So drive t1 to l1_4, load p2, drive to l1_3, unload. That's straightforward.

But wait, there are constraints. Let's check them one by one.

Constraints:

1. "Package p2 is in t2" must hold at least once. But t2 is a truck in city c2 (since locations in c2 are l2_1 to l2_5, and t2 is in l2_4 initially). So how can p2 get into t2? Since p2 starts in c1's l1_4. So maybe we need to transport p2 to c2 first? But the goal is to have p2 in l1_3 (c1). That seems conflicting. Wait, the constraint says p2 must be in t2 at least once. But t2 is in c2. So this means p2 has to be moved to c2, loaded into t2, then somehow brought back to c1? That complicates things. But the goal is to have p2 in l1_3, which is c1. So maybe this constraint requires that p2 is loaded into t2 in c2. But how does p2 get to c2? We need to use an airplane. So p2 would have to be flown from c1 to c2, loaded into t2, then flown back? That seems possible but adds steps. But that would make the plan longer. However, the user wants an optimal (shortest) plan, so maybe there's a way to satisfy this constraint without unnecessary steps.

Wait, maybe there's another way. Let's think. The constraint is that p2 must be in t2 at least once. But t2 is in c2. So to get p2 into t2, we need to bring p2 to c2. But the goal is to have p2 in c1's l1_3. So perhaps the plan must involve moving p2 to c2, loading into t2, then moving it back. But that's a lot. Let's see if there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to get t2 to c1? But trucks can't move between cities. They can only move within their city. Because the drivetruck action requires that l_from and l_to are in the same city. So t2 is in c2, so it can't leave c2. Therefore, p2 must be moved to c2 to be loaded into t2. So steps would be: take p2 from l1_4 (c1) to l1_1 via truck, load into a1, fly to l2_1, unload into a2 (but a2 is at l2_1?), wait, a2 is in l2_1 initially. Wait, the airplanes are a1 in l1_1 and a2 in l2_1. So to get p2 to c2, load p2 into a1, fly a1 to l2_1 (c2's airport), unload p2, then load into t2 (which is in c2's l2_4). But how to get t2 to l2_1? t2 is in l2_4. So drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1 (since they're in the same city c2). Then load p2 into t2. But then we need to get p2 back to c1. So fly it back using a2? But a2 is in l2_1. So load p2 into a2, fly to l1_1, unload, then use truck t1 to drive to l1_3. But this is getting complicated and would make the plan longer. But perhaps necessary to satisfy the constraint.

But this seems like a lot. Let's see if there's a way to meet the constraints without so many steps.

Looking at the constraints:

- p2 must be in t2 at least once.

But t2 is in c2. So p2 must be in c2 at some point.

But the goal is p2 in l1_3 (c1). So the plan has to take p2 to c2, load into t2, then bring it back. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the constraint can be satisfied by first moving p2 to c2, load into t2, then move it back. Let's think.

But that's going to add steps, but maybe necessary.

But let's also check other constraints:

Another constraint: "If p1 is in l1_1 in some state, then there must be an earlier state where p2 is in l2_4". So when we move p1 to l1_1 (to load onto a1), we need to have p2 in l2_4 before that. But p2 starts in l1_4. So how can p2 get to l2_4? It's in c2. Wait, no. l2_4 is in c2. p2 starts in l1_4 (c1). So to get p2 to l2_4, we need to transport it to c2. Which again requires flying. But why would we do that? Unless the constraint forces that.

Wait, the third constraint: If p1 is in l1_1 (which is necessary for loading onto a1), then there must be an earlier state where p2 is in l2_4. But p2 starts in l1_4. So how can p2 be in l2_4 before p1 is in l1_1? That would require moving p2 to l2_4 first, which is in c2, but that requires flying. So perhaps the plan must first move p2 to c2, put it in l2_4 (maybe via truck t2), then proceed with moving p1.

But that seems complicated. Let's outline possible steps.

Possible steps for p1:

1. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_4 (needs to be in same city c1).
2. Load p1 into t1 at l1_4.
3. Drive t1 to l1_1 (airport).
4. Unload p1 into l1_1.
5. Load p1 into a1.
6. Fly a1 to l2_1.
7. Unload p1 into l2_1.

But during this process, when we load p1 into a1 at l1_1 (step 5), the state when p1 is in l1_1 is after step 4. So before that, in some earlier state, p2 must be in l2_4.

But p2 starts in l1_4. To get p2 into l2_4 (which is in c2), we need to:

- Load p2 into a truck in c1 (like t1), drive to l1_1, load into a1, fly to l2_1, unload, load into t2 (drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1?), then drive t2 back to l2_4. But this would take a lot of steps.

Alternatively, maybe during the process of moving p1, we can also move p2. But given that the constraints require p2 to be in t2, perhaps we need to first handle p2's movement to c2.

But this seems to be a loop. Let's list all constraints again to ensure I don't miss any:

Constraints:

1. p2 in t2 at least once.

2. p1 in l1_1 at least once.

3. If p1 is in l1_1, then earlier p2 was in l2_4.

4. p1 in l1_4 at least once. (Which is true initially, but maybe after moving it?)

Wait, the initial state has p1 in l1_4, so unless we move it, this condition holds. But once we move p1, it's no longer in l1_4. So maybe the constraint requires that p1 is in l1_4 in some state, which is already satisfied by the initial state. So perhaps this constraint is automatically met.

But the fifth constraint: If p1 is in l1_4 in some state s, then p2 must be in l2_1 at s or after. So since the initial state has p1 in l1_4, then in that state, p2 must be in l2_1 at that state or later. But in the initial state, p2 is in l1_4, so that's not satisfied. Therefore, the initial state doesn't satisfy this constraint. Therefore, after moving p1 from l1_4, we need to ensure that whenever p1 is in l1_4 (which is only the initial state unless we move it back), p2 is in l2_1 at that time or later. Wait, but once p1 is moved out of l1_4, the only state where p1 is in l1_4 is the initial state, so the constraint would require that p2 is in l2_1 at some point after the initial state. So perhaps this constraint is already handled if in the plan, p2 ends up in l2_1 at some point. But the goal is to have p2 in l1_3. So how does this work?

Hmm, this is getting really complicated. Let's try to outline the steps considering all constraints.

Let's start with p1's movement to l2_1:

- To get p1 to l2_1, we need to load it into a1 at l1_1, fly to l2_1, unload. But before loading into a1, we need to drive p1 to l1_1.

But according to constraint 3, whenever p1 is in l1_1 (which happens after unloading from the truck there), there must have been a prior state where p2 is in l2_4. So how to get p2 to l2_4? Since p2 starts in l1_4 (c1), we need to move it to c2's l2_4. But l2_4 is in c2, so this requires flying p2 to c2's airport l2_1, then driving via t2 to l2_4.

So steps for p2 to reach l2_4:

1. Drive t1 (in c1) from l1_2 to l1_4.
2. Load p2 into t1 at l1_4.
3. Drive t1 to l1_1.
4. Unload p2 into l1_1.
5. Load p2 into a1.
6. Fly a1 to l2_1.
7. Unload p2 into l2_1.
8. Drive t2 (in c2) from l2_4 to l2_1.
9. Load p2 into t2 at l2_1.
10. Drive t2 back to l2_4.
11. Unload p2 into l2_4.

Now, after step 11, p2 is in l2_4. Then, when we later move p1 to l1_1 (step 4 of p1's movement), the constraint 3 is satisfied because p2 was in l2_4 at step 11.

But this adds a lot of steps. But perhaps necessary. But the goal is to have p2 in l1_3, so after step 11, we need to bring p2 back to c1's l1_3. Which would require:

12. Load p2 into t2 at l2_4 (but wait, p2 is in l2_4 after step 11. So drive t2 to l2_4 (but t2 is already there?), then load p2 into t2.

Wait, after step 11, p2 is unloaded into l2_4. So to load into t2, which is at l2_4 (since step 10 drove t2 back to l2_4?), wait, step 10 is drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4? No, step 10 is drive t2 back to l2_4. Wait, in step 8, t2 is driven from l2_4 to l2_1. Then step 10 is driving back to l2_4. So after step 10, t2 is in l2_4 again. Then step 11 unloads p2 into l2_4. Wait, no: steps 8-11:

8. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1 (to load p2 from l2_1 into t2).
9. Load p2 into t2 at l2_1.
10. Drive t2 back to l2_4.
11. Unload p2 into l2_4.

So after step 11, p2 is in l2_4. Now, to satisfy constraint 1 (p2 in t2 at least once), step 9 achieves that.

So now, after step 11, p2 is in l2_4, which satisfies the condition for constraint 3 when p1 is moved to l1_1. Then, we can proceed to move p1.

But then, after moving p1, we need to get p2 back to l1_3. Which would require:

12. Load p2 into t2 at l2_4.
13. Drive t2 to l2_1.
14. Unload p2 into l2_1.
15. Load p2 into a2 (which is at l2_1).
16. Fly a2 to l1_1.
17. Unload p2 into l1_1.
18. Drive t1 (in c1) to l1_1.
19. Load p2 into t1.
20. Drive t1 to l1_3.
21. Unload p2 into l1_3.

That's a lot of steps. But considering the constraints, maybe necessary. However, the problem requires an optimal (shortest) plan. This approach seems very lengthy, so perhaps there's a smarter way.

Alternative approach: Let's see if we can satisfy the constraints without moving p2 to c2.

But constraint 1 requires p2 to be in t2 at least once. t2 is in c2. So p2 must be loaded into t2, which is in c2. So p2 must be in c2 at some point.

Therefore, there's no way around moving p2 to c2, loading into t2, then moving it back.

But how to minimize steps?

Wait, maybe during the process of moving p1, we can also handle p2's movements in parallel. Let's think.

But the problem is sequential planning; actions are in sequence.

Alternative idea:

Use airplane a2 to transport p2 back. Because a2 is at l2_1 (c2's airport). So after p2 is in l2_1 (after being flown there), load into a2 and fly back to l1_1. But why would a2 fly to l1_1? Airplanes can fly between any airports. So fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1, unload p2, then use t1 to move to l1_3.

But this requires a2 to fly to l1_1. Then, after that, a2 is in l1_1. But maybe that's acceptable.

Let's try to outline steps:

For p1:

1. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_4.
2. Load p1 into t1.
3. Drive t1 to l1_1.
4. Unload p1 into l1_1. (Now p1 is in l1_1, which triggers constraint 3: check if earlier p2 was in l2_4. So before this step, p2 must have been in l2_4.)

For p2 to reach l2_4 before step 4:

A. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1 (c2's airport). (But t2 is initially in l2_4.)
B. Load p2 into t2. Wait, p2 is in l1_4 initially. So we need to get p2 to c2 first.

So steps for p2:

a. Drive t1 to l1_4 (same as step 1).
b. Load p2 into t1 (after step 1).
c. Drive t1 to l1_1.
d. Unload p2 into l1_1.
e. Load p2 into a1.
f. Fly a1 to l2_1.
g. Unload p2 into l2_1.
h. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
i. Load p2 into t2.
j. Drive t2 back to l2_4.
k. Unload p2 into l2_4.

Now, after step k, p2 is in l2_4. Then step 4 (unload p1 into l1_1) comes after step k. So constraint 3 is satisfied.

Then, continue with p1's steps:

5. Load p1 into a1 at l1_1.
6. Fly a1 to l2_1.
7. Unload p1 into l2_1. (Goal for p1 achieved.)

Now, for p2 to get back to l1_3:

After step k, p2 is in l2_4. To get it back:

l. Drive t2 to l2_4 (if not already there).
m. Load p2 into t2.
n. Drive t2 to l2_1.
o. Unload p2 into l2_1.
p. Load p2 into a2.
q. Fly a2 to l1_1.
r. Unload p2 into l1_1.
s. Drive t1 to l1_1 (if not already there; after step 3, t1 is at l1_1).
t. Load p2 into t1.
u. Drive t1 to l1_3.
v. Unload p2 into l1_3. (Goal achieved.)

But this is a lot of steps. Let's count:

Steps a to k are 11 steps (a=1, b=2, c=3, d=4, e=5, f=6, g=7, h=8, i=9, j=10, k=11).

Then steps 1-7 for p1: steps 12-18.

Then steps l to v for p2: steps 19-29.

Total of 29 steps. That's way too long. But maybe there's a way to optimize.

Wait, maybe some steps can be reused. For example, steps 1 and a are the same: drive t1 to l1_4. So if we can load both p1 and p2 into t1 at l1_4, then drive to l1_1 together. But the problem is that trucks can carry multiple packages? The problem doesn't specify any capacity limits, so perhaps possible.

So, adjust steps:

1. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_4.
2. Load p1 into t1.
3. Load p2 into t1. (Both packages are in t1 now.)
4. Drive t1 to l1_1.
5. Unload p1 into l1_1.
6. Unload p2 into l1_1.

Now, both p1 and p2 are at l1_1. Then, load p1 into a1, fly to l2_1. For p2, need to fly to c2.

But wait, we need p2 to be loaded into t2 in c2. So after flying p2 to l2_1:

7. Load p2 into a1 (with p1? Or use another airplane? Wait, a1 is at l1_1. If we fly a1 to l2_1, then unload both p1 and p2? But p1's goal is l2_1, so that's fine. But p2 needs to go into t2. So after unloading p2 at l2_1:

8. Fly a1 to l2_1 (after loading p1 and p2).
Wait, but a1 can only carry packages if they are loaded. So steps would be:

After step 6:

7. Load p1 into a1.
8. Load p2 into a1. (Assuming airplanes can carry multiple packages.)
9. Fly a1 to l2_1.
10. Unload p1 into l2_1. (Goal for p1 done.)
11. Unload p2 into l2_1.
12. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
13. Load p2 into t2.
14. Drive t2 back to l2_4.
15. Unload p2 into l2_4. (Now constraint 1 is met: p2 in t2 at step 13.)

Now, to get p2 back to l1_3:

16. Drive t2 to l2_1 again.
17. Load p2 into t2.
18. Drive t2 to l2_1. (Wait, but t2 is already there. Maybe fly p2 back using a2.)

16. Load p2 into a2 at l2_1.
17. Fly a2 to l1_1.
18. Unload p2 into l1_1.
19. Drive t1 to l1_1 (already there after step 4).
20. Load p2 into t1.
21. Drive t1 to l1_3.
22. Unload p2 into l1_3. (Goal achieved.)

This reduces steps. Let's count:

Steps 1-22, but some steps might be redundant.

But let's check constraints:

- Constraint 1: p2 in t2 at step 13: yes.

- Constraint 2: p1 in l1_1 at step 5: yes.

- Constraint 3: when p1 is in l1_1 (step 5), before that, p2 must have been in l2_4. But in this plan, p2 is in l2_4 only after step 15. Which comes after step 5. So this violates the constraint. Because when p1 is in l1_1 (step 5), the constraint requires that there was an earlier state where p2 was in l2_4. But in this plan, p2 is moved to l2_4 after step 15, which is after step 5. So this doesn't satisfy constraint 3. Therefore, this approach is invalid.

Hmm, this is a problem. So to satisfy constraint 3, before p1 is in l1_1 (step 5), p2 must have been in l2_4. But in this plan, p2 reaches l2_4 at step 15, which is after step 5. So this approach is invalid.

Therefore, the initial idea of moving p2 to l2_4 before moving p1 is necessary.

So perhaps the only way is to first move p2 to l2_4, then proceed with moving p1.

But this requires a lot of steps. Let's try to outline:

Steps for p2 to reach l2_4:

1. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_4.
2. Load p2 into t1.
3. Drive t1 to l1_1.
4. Unload p2 into l1_1.
5. Load p2 into a1.
6. Fly a1 to l2_1.
7. Unload p2 into l2_1.
8. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
9. Load p2 into t2.
10. Drive t2 back to l2_4.
11. Unload p2 into l2_4. (Now constraint 1 is met here: p2 in t2 at step 9.)

Now, after this, p1 can be moved:

12. Drive t1 from l1_1 (after step 3) to l1_4 (assuming t1 is at l1_1 after step 3). Wait, step 3 drives t1 to l1_1, then unload p2. So t1 is at l1_1. To move p1, which is at l1_4:

Wait, p1 is initially at l1_4. So after step 1, t1 is at l1_4. Then steps 1-3 are for p2. But p1 is still at l1_4. To move p1, after step 11, need to:

12. Drive t1 from l1_1 back to l1_4. (Assuming t1 was left at l1_1 after step 3.)

Wait, but after step 3, t1 is at l1_1. So steps:

12. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_4.
13. Load p1 into t1.
14. Drive t1 to l1_1.
15. Unload p1 into l1_1.
16. Load p1 into a1 (which is at l2_1 after step 6).
Wait, a1 was flown to l2_1 in step 6. So a1 is now at l2_1. So to load p1 into a1, we need a1 to be at l1_1. But after step 6, a1 is at l2_1. So we need to fly a1 back to l1_1?

That complicates things. Alternatively, use a different airplane. But there's a2 at l2_1. But we need to get p1 to l2_1, which is the goal. So perhaps:

After step 15, p1 is in l1_1. Then, load into a1 (but a1 is in l2_1). So we need to fly a1 back to l1_1.

16. Fly a1 from l2_1 to l1_1.
17. Load p1 into a1.
18. Fly a1 back to l2_1.
19. Unload p1 into l2_1. (Goal achieved.)

But this adds more steps. So now, steps 1-19. Plus steps for p2 to get back to l1_3.

After step 11, p2 is in l2_4. To get back:

20. Drive t2 to l2_4 (already there after step 10).
21. Load p2 into t2.
22. Drive t2 to l2_1.
23. Unload p2 into l2_1.
24. Load p2 into a2.
25. Fly a2 to l1_1.
26. Unload p2 into l1_1.
27. Drive t1 (which is at l1_1 after step 14) to l1_3.
28. Load p2 into t1.
29. Drive t1 to l1_3.
30. Unload p2 into l1_3.

This is getting extremely lengthy. There must be a better way.

Wait, perhaps there's a way to combine steps. For example, after moving p2 to l2_4 (step 11), and then moving p1, perhaps we can use a2 to fly p2 back.

But let's think differently. What if we use airplane a2 to transport p2 back from c2 to c1. But a2 is initially at l2_1. So after p2 is in l2_4, we can drive t2 to l2_4, load p2, drive to l2_1, load into a2, fly to l1_1, then use t1 to move to l1_3.

But this still requires several steps.

Another constraint to consider: "If p1 is in l1_4 in some state s, then p2 must be in l2_1 at s or after." The initial state has p1 in l1_4, so we need p2 to be in l2_1 at some point after the initial state. Which we already have when p2 is flown to l2_1 in step 7. So that constraint is satisfied.

Another constraint: "At least one of p2 is in t2 or p2 is in l1_5". Since in the plan, p2 is in t2 (step 9), this is satisfied.

Another constraint: "Package p2 is in l1_3" (the goal), which is achieved at the end.

Another constraint: If p2 is in l1_3, then earlier either p2 was in l2_4 or p1 was in l1_2. In our plan, p2 was in l2_4 (step 11), so this is satisfied.

Another constraint: "At least one of p1 is in a2 or p2 is in a1". Let's see: in step 5, p2 is loaded into a1 (step 5), so this is satisfied. So during step 5-6, p2 is in a1.

Another constraint: "Both p1 and p2 are in a2". So at least one state must have both in a2. But in the current plan, p1 is never in a2, and p2 is in a2 during step 24. So unless we load both into a2, this constraint isn't met. So we need to have both p1 and p2 in a2 at some point.

This adds another layer: we need to have both p1 and p2 loaded into a2. But how? Because p1 needs to be in l2_1, and p2 needs to be in l1_3.

Perhaps after p1 is in l2_1 (goal), we can load it into a2, then fly a2 to l1_1 with both p1 and p2. But that's unnecessary.

Alternatively, during the process of moving p2 back, load both into a2.

But this is getting too complicated. This problem has many constraints, and ensuring all are met is challenging.

Given the time I have, perhaps I should proceed with a step-by-step plan that satisfies all constraints, even if it's long, but I'll look for optimizations.

Let me try to outline a possible valid plan:

1. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_4. (To load p1 and p2.)
2. Load p1 into t1.
3. Load p2 into t1.
4. Drive t1 to l1_1.
5. Unload p1 into l1_1. (Now p1 is in l1_1, constraint 2 met.)
6. Unload p2 into l1_1. (Now p2 is in l1_1.)
7. Load p2 into a1. (To fly to c2.)
8. Fly a1 to l2_1.
9. Unload p2 into l2_1. (Now p2 is in l2_1.)
10. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
11. Load p2 into t2. (Constraint 1 met.)
12. Drive t2 back to l2_4.
13. Unload p2 into l2_4. (Now, before step 5 (p1 in l1_1), p2 was in l2_4 at step 13. But step 5 is before step 13, so this violates constraint 3. So invalid.)

Ah, here's the problem. So steps 5 (p1 in l1_1) happens before step 13 (p2 in l2_4). Therefore, the constraint 3 is violated because when p1 is in l1_1 (step 5), there's no earlier state where p2 was in l2_4.

Thus, this approach is invalid.

Alternative approach: First move p2 to l2_4 before moving p1 to l1_1.

So steps:

1. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_4.
2. Load p2 into t1.
3. Drive t1 to l1_1.
4. Unload p2 into l1_1.
5. Load p2 into a1.
6. Fly a1 to l2_1.
7. Unload p2 into l2_1.
8. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
9. Load p2 into t2.
10. Drive t2 back to l2_4.
11. Unload p2 into l2_4. (Now p2 is in l2_4.)

Now, after step 11, p2 is in l2_4. Now, move p1:

12. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_4. (Assuming t1 was at l1_1 after step 3.)
13. Load p1 into t1.
14. Drive t1 to l1_1.
15. Unload p1 into l1_1. (Now, p1 is in l1_1. Constraint 3 is satisfied because p2 was in l2_4 at step 11, which is before step 15.)
16. Load p1 into a1. (But a1 is at l2_1 after step 6. So need to fly a1 back to l1_1.)
17. Fly a1 from l2_1 to l1_1.
18. Load p1 into a1.
19. Fly a1 to l2_1.
20. Unload p1 into l2_1. (Goal met.)

Now, for p2 to get to l1_3:

21. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
22. Load p2 into t2.
23. Drive t2 to l2_1.
24. Unload p2 into l2_1.
25. Load p2 into a2.
26. Fly a2 to l1_1.
27. Unload p2 into l1_1.
28. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_3. (Assuming t1 is at l1_1 after step 14.)
29. Load p2 into t1.
30. Drive t1 to l1_3.
31. Unload p2 into l1_3. (Goal met.)

Now, check constraints:

- Constraint 1: p2 in t2 at step 9: yes.

- Constraint 2: p1 in l1_1 at step 15: yes.

- Constraint 3: p1 in l1_1 at step 15, earlier state step 11 (p2 in l2_4): yes.

- Constraint 4: p1 in l1_4 at least once. Initially true, but after step 13, p1 is loaded into t1 from l1_4. So after step 13, p1 is in t1, so l1_4 no longer has p1. But the initial state has p1 in l1_4, so that state counts. So constraint 4 is met.

- Constraint 5: If p1 is in l1_4 in some state, then p2 is in l2_1 after. The initial state has p1 in l1_4, so p2 must be in l2_1 at or after. p2 is moved to l2_1 at step 7, which is after the initial state. So constraint met.

- Constraint 6: At least one of p2 in t2 or p2 in l1_5. Step 9: p2 in t2, so met.

- Constraint 7: p2 in l1_3 at the end: yes.

- Constraint 8: If p2 in l1_3, then earlier p2 in l2_4 or p1 in l1_2. p2 was in l2_4 at step 11, so met.

- Constraint 9: At least one of p1 in a2 or p2 in a1. p2 was in a1 during step 5-6, so met.

- Constraint 10: Both p1 and p2 in a2. Need to have at least one state where both are in a2. Currently, p1 is never in a2, and p2 is in a2 during step 25-26. So this constraint is not met. Therefore, need to adjust the plan.

To satisfy constraint 10, we need a state where both p1 and p2 are in a2. How?

Perhaps after p1 is in l2_1 (step 20), load p1 into a2, then load p2 into a2 as well.

Adjust steps after step 20:

21. Load p1 into a2 from l2_1.
22. Drive t2 to l2_1 (if not already there).
23. Load p2 into a2.
24. Fly a2 to l1_1 with both p1 and p2.
25. Unload both.

But this would require p1 to be in a2, which is okay, but p1's goal is l2_1. So loading p1 into a2 after it's already in l2_1 would take it away from its goal location. Therefore, this approach would require moving p1 again, which is not allowed since the goal is to have p1 in l2_1.

Alternatively, before moving p1 to l2_1, load both into a2.

But how? Let's think.

Maybe after step 15 (p1 in l1_1), instead of using a1, use a2 to transport both p1 and p2.

But a2 is initially in l2_1. So need to fly a2 to l1_1 first.

Adjust steps after step 15:

16. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
17. Load p1 into a2.
18. Load p2 into a2. (But p2 is in l2_4 at step 11. Wait, no, in this plan, after step 11, p2 is in l2_4. Then steps 12-20 move p1 to l2_1. Then p2 is still in l2_4. So this approach doesn't work.

Hmm. This is getting too complicated. Perhaps the only way to satisfy constraint 10 is to have both p1 and p2 in a2 during their transportation.

Alternative idea: When moving p2 back to c1, use a2 and load both p1 and p2 into it.

But p1 is in l2_1 (goal), so we can't move it. So this isn't possible.

Alternatively, during the transportation of p1 to l2_1, use a2 instead of a1. But a1 is in c1's airport initially.

Alternatively, after p1 is in l2_1, load it into a2 and then fly to l1_1 with p2.

But this would move p1 away from its goal, which is invalid.

Given the time I'm spending, I think I need to proceed with a plan that satisfies all constraints except possibly constraint 10, but I must find a way to meet it.

Wait, constraint 10 requires that there's at least one state where both p1 and p2 are in a2. So perhaps during the return trip of p2 to c1, we can load both into a2. But how?

After p1 is in l2_1 (goal), we can load p1 into a2 (but it's already at the goal, so this is not allowed). Alternatively, before p1 reaches l2_1, but that would complicate the goal.

Alternatively, after p1 is in l2_1, we can load it into a2 (even though it's at the goal) and fly somewhere else. But that would invalidate the goal. So that's not allowed.

Therefore, the only way to satisfy constraint 10 is to have both p1 and p2 in a2 before p1 is delivered to l2_1.

So perhaps during the transportation of p1 to l2_1, use a2 instead of a1. Let's adjust:

Steps 1-11: same as before to get p2 to l2_4.

12. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_4.
13. Load p1 into t1.
14. Drive t1 to l1_1.
15. Unload p1 into l1_1.
16. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
17. Load p1 into a2.
18. Load p2 into a2. (But p2 is in l2_4. So this is not possible.)

No, p2 is in l2_4, so can't be loaded into a2 at l1_1.

Therefore, perhaps during the return trip of p2 to c1, use a2 and have both p1 and p2 in it. But how?

After p1 is in l2_1 (step 20), and p2 is in l2_4, we need to move p2 back:

21. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
22. Load p2 into t2.
23. Drive t2 to l2_1.
24. Unload p2 into l2_1.
25. Load p2 into a2.
26. Fly a2 to l1_1.
27. Unload p2 into l1_1.
28. Load p1 into a2. (But p1 is in l2_1, which is in c2's airport. So a2 is at l2_1. So can we load p1 into a2 at l2_1?)

Wait, p1 is in l2_1. a2 is at l2_1. So steps:

25. Load p1 into a2 at l2_1.
26. Load p2 into a2 at l2_1.
27. Fly a2 to l1_1.
28. Unload p1 and p2 into l1_1.

But this would require p1 to be moved from l2_1 to l1_1, which is against the goal. So this is invalid.

Hmm, this is really tricky. Maybe the only way is to have a state where both are in a2 during transportation, but that would require moving p1 via a2, which would mean not using a1.

Alternative approach:

Use a2 to transport p1 from l1_1 to l2_1. Then, during that trip, also have p2 in a2.

Steps:

After step 15 (p1 in l1_1):

16. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
17. Load p1 into a2.
18. Fly a2 to l2_1.
19. Unload p1 into l2_1. (Goal met.)

Meanwhile, after p2 is in l2_4 (step 11), move it back:

20. Drive t2 to l2_1.
21. Load p2 into t2.
22. Drive t2 to l2_1.
23. Unload p2 into l2_1.
24. Load p2 into a2.
25. Fly a2 to l1_1.
26. Unload p2 into l1_1.
27. Drive t1 to l1_3.
28. Load p2 into t1.
29. Unload p2 into l1_3.

But during step 24, p2 is loaded into a2. If during step 17, p1 is also loaded into a2, then steps 17 and 24 would both load into a2. But they are at different times. To have both in a2 at the same time:

After step 16: a2 is at l1_1.

17. Load p1 into a2.
18. Load p2 into a2. (But p2 is in l2_4. Can't load at l1_1.)

No. So this doesn't work.

Given the time constraints, I'll have to proceed with a plan that meets all constraints except possibly the last one, but I must find a way. Alternatively, maybe there's a step where both p1 and p2 are in a2 during their transportation.

Wait, when p2 is being flown back to l1_1 via a2, and if p1 is also in a2 during that flight. But p1 is already in l2_1 (goal), so can't be moved.

This seems impossible. Therefore, perhaps the problem has a typo, or I'm missing something.

Wait, the initial state lists "Package a1 is in location l1_1" and "Package a2 is in location l2_1". This must be a mistake. It should be "Airplane a1 is in location l1_1". Assuming that, then the airplanes are correctly placed, and the packages p1 and p2 are in l1_4.

With that correction, the planning becomes feasible. But given the problem statement as is, I have to proceed.

Given the time I've spent and the complexity, I think the optimal plan involves moving p1 via a1 and p2 via t1 and a1, then meeting the constraints through careful ordering.

Final attempt:

1. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_4.
2. Load p1 and p2 into t1.
3. Drive t1 to l1_1.
4. Unload p1 and p2 into l1_1.
5. Load p2 into a1.
6. Fly a1 to l2_1.
7. Unload p2 into l2_1.
8. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
9. Load p2 into t2. (Constraint 1 met.)
10. Drive t2 back to l2_4.
11. Unload p2 into l2_4. (Now, before step 12, which moves p1, we have p2 in l2_4.)

12. Load p1 into a1 (which is at l2_1 now, so need to fly back.)
13. Fly a1 to l1_1.
14. Load p1 into a1.
15. Fly a1 to l2_1.
16. Unload p1 into l2_1. (Goal.)

17. Drive t2 to l2_1.
18. Load p2 into t2.
19. Drive t2 to l2_1.
20. Unload p2 into l2_1.
21. Load p2 into a2.
22. Fly a2 to l1_1.
23. Unload p2 into l1_1.
24. Drive t1 to l1_3.
25. Load p2 into t1.
26. Unload p2 into l1_3. (Goal.)

Now, check constraints:

- Constraint 10: Both p1 and p2 in a2. In this plan, p2 is in a2 (step 21), but p1 is never in a2. So this constraint isn't met.

To meet it, perhaps during step 21, also load p1 into a2. But p1 is in l2_1 (goal), so we can't move it. Therefore, this plan doesn't satisfy constraint 10.

This suggests that the problem might require a different approach where both packages are loaded into a2 at some point. Perhaps during the initial movement of p1:

After step 14, p1 is in a1. Instead, use a2:

But a2 is in l2_1 initially. So fly a2 to l1_1, load p1 and p2, fly back.

But this complicates.

Alternatively, after p2 is in l2_1 (step 7), load both p1 and p2 into a2 and fly to l1_1.

But p1 is in l1_1 (step 4), so after step 7, p1 is in l1_1 and p2 is in l2_1. To load both into a2, need to have them in the same location.

This is impossible unless we move p1 to l2_1, which is the goal, but then can't move it again.

Given the time I've invested and the complexity, I'll provide a plan that meets most constraints but may have an error in constraint 10, but I'll look for a step where both are in a2.

Wait, during step 21, p2 is loaded into a2. If we also load p1 into a2 at l2_1, but p1 is in l2_1 (goal), so loading it would remove it from the goal. But maybe after delivering p1 to l2_1, we can load it into a2 for a short time.

For example:

After step 16 (p1 in l2_1):

17. Load p1 into a2.
18. Load p2 into a2.
19. Fly a2 to l1_1. (This would move p1 away from l2_1, invalidating the goal.)

So this is not possible.

Therefore, the only way to satisfy constraint 10 is to have both packages in a2 before p1 is delivered to l2_1. Which would require transporting p1 via a2 and loading p2 into a2 during that trip.

But how?

Alternative plan:

1. Drive t1 to l1_4, load p1 and p2.
2. Drive to l1_1, unload.
3. Load p1 and p2 into a2 (but a2 is in l2_1. Need to fly a2 to l1_1 first.)
4. Fly a2 to l1_1.
5. Load p1 and p2 into a2.
6. Fly a2 to l2_1.
7. Unload both. Now p1 is in l2_1 (goal), p2 in l2_1.
8. Drive t2 to l2_1, load p2.
9. Drive t2 to l2_4, unload p2. (Constraint 1 met.)
10. Then, drive t2 back to l2_1, load p2, fly back to l1_1 via a2, etc.

But this plan skips some constraints but meets others. Let's check:

Constraint 3: p1 in l1_1 (step 2) requires p2 to have been in l2_4 earlier. But in this plan, p2 is in l2_4 after step 9, which is after step 2. So violates constraint 3.

This is very challenging. Given the time, I'll proceed with a plan that I think satisfies all constraints except possibly the last one, and adjust if possible.
