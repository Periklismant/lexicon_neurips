Let me understand the problem. We have packages, trucks, airplanes, cities, and locations. Our goal is to bring about the following situation:
- Package p1 is in location l2_5
- Package p2 is in location l1_1

We need to do this while adhering to various constraints, which I'll go through one by one:

1. Package p2 must be in location l2_5 at some point.
2. If p2 is in l2_5, then it must be moved to l1_2 either immediately or sometime after.
3. Package p1 must be in location l1_1 at some point.
4. If p1 is in l1_1, then there must be an earlier state where p2 is in l1_5 or l1_4.
5. At some point, p2 must be in truck t1 and p1 must be in location l1_3.
6. At some point, either p2 is in location l1_2 or p1 is in location l2_2.
7. p2 must be in truck t1 at some point.
8. p2 must be in location l1_5 at some point.
9. p1 must be in location l1_2 at some point.

Now, let's understand the initial state:
- Trucks t1 and t2 are in locations l1_5 and l2_3, respectively.
- Packages p1 and p2 are in locations l1_5 and l2_5, respectively.
- Airplanes a1 and a2 are in locations l1_1 and l2_1, respectively.

One thing I'm noticing right away is that the initial state seems to have packages, trucks, and airplanes all referred to as "Package" in the initial state. This is a bit confusing, but I'll interpret it as follows:
- t1 is in location l1_5
- t2 is in location l2_3
- p1 is in location l1_5
- p2 is in location l2_5
- a1 is in location l1_1
- a2 is in location l2_1

So, based on the initial state, we see that p2 is already in l2_5, which satisfies constraint 1.

Let me start by outlining a high-level plan. According to the constraints, we need to ensure that various packages are in specific locations at certain points in the plan. I'll try to ensure all these constraints are met while ultimately bringing p1 to l2_5 and p2 to l1_1.

First, let's identify the constraints that dictate the order of operations:
- Constraint 4 tells us that before p1 is in l1_1, p2 must be in l1_5 or l1_4.
- Constraint 2 tells us that if p2 is in l2_5, it should move to l1_2.

Considering the initial state where p2 is already in l2_5, we know we need to move p2 to l1_2 at some point.

Let's lay out a tentative plan and then refine it:

1. From the initial state, p2 is in l2_5 (constraint 1 satisfied).
2. We'll need to move p2 from l2_5 to l1_2 (due to constraint 2). This will involve using both a truck and an airplane, as they're in different cities.
3. We'll need to make sure p2 is in l1_5 at some point (constraint 8).
4. We'll need to ensure p2 is in truck t1 at some point (constraints 5 and 7).
5. We'll need to ensure p1 goes to l1_2 at some point (constraint 9).
6. We'll need to ensure p1 is in location l1_3 while p2 is in truck t1 (constraint 5).
7. We'll need to make sure p1 goes to l1_1 (constraint 3), but before doing so, p2 should have been in l1_5 or l1_4 (constraint 4).
8. Ultimately, we need to have p1 in l2_5 and p2 in l1_1 (the main goal).

Let's think step by step how to bring this about.

From the initial state:
- p1 is in l1_5
- p2 is in l2_5
- t1 is in l1_5
- t2 is in l2_3
- a1 is in l1_1
- a2 is in l2_1

Let's first identify how to move p2 from l2_5 to l1_2. We'll need to use t2 to drive p2 to the airport l2_1, then fly it to l1_1 using an airplane, and finally drive it to l1_2 using t1. However, we also need to ensure that p2 is in l1_5 at some point. Let's adjust the plan:

1. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_5 to pick up p2.
2. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_5.
3. Drive t2 with p2 to l2_1 (the airport).
4. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1.
5. Load p2 onto a2 at l2_1.
6. Fly a2 with p2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
7. Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1.

Now, we need to get p2 to l1_5, and we know t1 is already there:
8. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_1.
9. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_1.
10. Drive t1 with p2 to l1_5. (constraint 8 satisfied)
11. p2 is in t1 at this point. (constraints 7 satisfied)

Now, we need to move p1 to l1_3 while p2 is still in t1:
12. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_5 (wait, p1 isn't in t1, so I'll skip this step).
13. Drive t1 with p2 to l1_3.
14. Drive t1 with p2 from l1_3 to l1_2. (constraint 2 satisfied, p2 moved to l1_2 after being in l2_5)
15. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_2.

Now, p2 is in l1_2. We need to move p1 from l1_5 to various locations as per constraints:
16. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_5.
17. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_5.
18. Drive t1 with p1 to l1_2. (constraint 9 satisfied)
19. Drive t1 with p1 to l1_3. (constraint 5 will be satisfied if we ensure p2 is in t1 at this point, but we just unloaded it, so I'll need to rethink this)

Wait, I'm noticing that I can't satisfy constraint 5 with my current plan because I unloaded p2 before bringing p1 to l1_3. Let me rethink:

1. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_5 to pick up p2.
2. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_5.
3. Drive t2 with p2 to l2_1 (the airport).
4. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1.
5. Load p2 onto a2 at l2_1.
6. Fly a2 with p2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
7. Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1.
8. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_1.
9. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_1.
10. Drive t1 with p2 to l1_5. (constraint 8 satisfied)
11. p2 is in t1 at this point. (constraints 7 satisfied)

At this point, we need to ensure p1 is in l1_3 while p2 is in t1. p1 is in l1_5, and t1 with p2 is also in l1_5.

12. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_5. Now, both p1 and p2 are in t1.
13. Drive t1 with both packages to l1_3. (This step isn't valid because we can't unload p1 from t1 at l1_3 while keeping p2 in t1. We want p1 to be in l1_3 and p2 to be in t1, not both in t1.)

Actually, wait. Let me re-read the constraints. Constraint 5 states: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "The following conditions are all true: "Package p2 is in t1", "Package p1 is in location l1_3"""

This means at some point, p2 should be in truck t1 AND p1 should be in location l1_3. They don't necessarily have to be in these states at the exact same time. So, my plan can have p2 in t1 at one point and then later, p1 can be in l1_3.

Let me rethink...

Ok, rereading again, I think constraint 5 requires that at some point, BOTH p2 is in t1 AND p1 is in location l1_3. These conditions need to be true at the same time. So I can't have p2 in t1 at one point and then later, p1 is in l1_3. They need to be true simultaneously.

Actually no, "the following conditions are all true" means they need to be true simultaneously. So constraint 5 indeed requires that at some state, p2 is in t1 AND p1 is in location l1_3 simultaneously.

Let me rethink...

Ah, I have a unique insight: after loading p2 onto t1, I don't need to load p1 onto t1. I can drive t1 (with p2) from l1_5 to l1_3, and then in a separate action (not shown in my current plan), I can drive p1 to l1_3 as well. That way, at some point, p2 will be in t1 and p1 will be in l1_3, satisfying constraint 5.

Let me revise my plan. Actually, I need to figure out how to get p1 to l1_3 if it's in l1_5:

10. Drive t1 with p2 to l1_3. (now, p2 is in t1 in location l1_3)

Now, I need to get p1 to l1_3:
11. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_3.
12. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_5.
13. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_5.
14. Drive t1 with p1 to l1_3. (but now p2 is in l1_3 and p1 is in t1, which doesn't satisfy constraint 5)

Actually, I still can't satisfy constraint 5 with this plan. I need p2 to be in t1 (not just in location l1_3) and p1 to be in location l1_3 (not in t1) at the same time.

Let me think about another approach...

I need to find a way to have p2 in t1 and p1 in l1_3 at the same time.

What if I leave p1 at l1_3 and then use t1 to pick up p2? Let's try that:

1. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_3.
2. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_5. (oops, I meant to do this before driving)

Let me start over:

1. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_5.
2. Drive t1 with p1 to l1_3.
3. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_3. Now, p1 is in location l1_3.

Next, we need to get p2 into t1 while p1 remains in l1_3:
4. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_5.
5. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_5.
6. Drive t2 with p2 to l2_1.
7. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1.
8. Load p2 onto a2 at l2_1.
9. Fly a2 with p2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
10. Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1.
11. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1.
12. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_1.
13. Drive t1 with p2 to l1_3. Now, p2 is in t1 and p1 is in location l1_3, satisfying constraint 5.

Ah wait, I'm neglecting the constraint 6 which says "At least one of the following conditions is true: "Package p2 is in location l1_2", "Package p1 is in location l2_2".

So, at some point, either p2 should be in l1_2 or p1 should be in l2_2. Let's continue the plan to ensure one of these is true:

14. Drive t1 with p2 from l1_3 to l1_2.
15. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_2. Now, p2 is in location l1_2, satisfying constraint 6.

Now, we need to ensure that p2 is in l1_5 at some point (constraint 8). Given that p2 is in l1_2, we can:
16. Drive t1 from l1_2 to p2's location (l1_2).
17. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_2.
18. Drive t1 with p2 to l1_5.
19. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_5. Now, p2 is in location l1_5, satisfying constraint 8.

Following constraint 4, before p1 is in l1_1, p2 should be in l1_5 or l1_4. We've arranged for p2 to be in l1_5 already, so now we can move p1 to l1_1:
20. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_3 (where p1 is).
21. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_3.
22. Drive t1 with p1 to l1_1.
23. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1. Now, p1 is in location l1_1, satisfying constraint 3.

Next, we need to ensure p1 is in l1_2 at some point (constraint 9). Given that p1 is in l1_1, we can:
24. Drive t1 from l1_1 to p1's location (l1_1).
25. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_1.
26. Drive t1 with p1 to l1_2.
27. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_2. Now, p1 is in location l1_2, satisfying constraint 9.

Finally, we need to bring about the goal state: p1 in l2_5 and p2 in l1_1. 

Let's move p1 to l2_5:
28. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1.
29. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_2. (I need to correct this, since I'm claiming t1 is at l1_1 and then loading at l1_2. Let me fix it.) 
28. Drive t1 from l1_2 to p1's location (l1_2).
29. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_2.
30. Drive t1 with p1 to l1_1.
31. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1.
32. Load p1 onto a1 at l1_1.
33. Fly a1 with p1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
34. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1.
35. Drive t2 from its last location (which was l2_1 from earlier steps) to l2_1.
36. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_1.
37. Drive t2 with p1 to l2_5.
38. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_5. Now, p1 is in location l2_5, partially satisfying the goal.

Let's move p2 to l1_1:
39. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_5 (where p2 is).
40. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_5.
41. Drive t1 with p2 to l1_1.
42. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1. Now, p2 is in location l1_1, fully satisfying the goal.

Ok that plan makes sense, but let me re-read it more carefully to make sure I'm not missing something.

Oh, wait, I misunderstood something. The fact that we previously satisfied the goal doesn't mean we're done. We need to ensure all the constraints are met throughout the plan.

Let me actually restructure my plan a bit and make sure it satisfies all constraints:

From the initial state:
- p1 is in l1_5
- p2 is in l2_5
- t1 is in l1_5
- t2 is in l2_3
- a1 is in l1_1
- a2 is in l2_1

First, let's ensure p2 is in l2_5 (constraint 1). This is already true in the initial state.

Next, let's move p2 to l1_2 to satisfy constraint 2 (after p2 is in l2_5, it should move to l1_2). This will also satisfy constraint 6 (at some point, either p2 should be in l1_2 or p1 should be in l2_2).

1. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_5.
2. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_5.
3. Drive t2 with p2 to l2_1.
4. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1.
5. Load p2 onto a2 at l2_1.
6. Fly a2 with p2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
7. Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1.
8. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_1.
9. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_1.
10. Drive t1 with p2 to l1_2.
11. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_2. Now, p2 is in location l1_2, satisfying constraint 6 and at some point constraint 2.

next, let's ensure p2 is in l1_5 at some point (constraint 8):
12. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_5.
13. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_5. (p1 was initially in l1_5)
14. Drive t1 with p1 to l1_3.
15. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_3. Now, p1 is in location l1_3.
16. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_2.
17. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_2.
18. Drive t1 with p2 to l1_3.

Now, at this point, p2 is in t1 and p1 is in location l1_3, satisfying constraint 5.

19. Drive t1 with p2 to l1_5.
20. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_5. Now, p2 is in location l1_5, satisfying constraint 8.

Next, let's ensure p1 is in l1_2 at some point (constraint 9):
21. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_3.
22. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_3.
23. Drive t1 with p1 to l1_2.
24. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_2. Now, p1 is in location l1_2, satisfying constraint 9.

Next, let's move p1 to l1_1 (constraint 3). Before doing so, we need to ensure p2 is in l1_5 or l1_4 (constraint 4). We've already ensured p2 is in l1_5 at some point (step 20), so we can proceed.
25. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1.
26. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_2. (This doesn't match up, t1 is in l1_1 but I'm trying to load p1 at l1_2. Let me fix it.)
25. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_2. (redundant step, removing)
25. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_2.
26. Drive t1 with p1 to l1_1.
27. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1. Now, p1 is in location l1_1, satisfying constraint 3.

Finally, let's achieve the goal state: p1 in l2_5 and p2 in l1_1.

For p1 to be in l2_5:
28. Load p1 onto a1 at l1_1.
29. Fly a1 with p1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
30. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1.
31. Drive t2 from its last location (which was l2_1 from earlier steps) to l2_1.
32. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_1.
33. Drive t2 with p1 to l2_5.
34. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_5. Now, p1 is in location l2_5, partially satisfying the goal.

For p2 to be in l1_1:
35. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_5.
36. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_5.
37. Drive t1 with p2 to l1_1.
38. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1. Now, p2 is in location l1_1, fully satisfying the goal.

Ok, I think this plan should work. Let me check if I've overlooked any constraint:

1. Constraint 1: ✓ p2 is in l2_5 in the initial state.
2. Constraint 2: ✓ After p2 is in l2_5, it moves to l1_2 at step 11.
3. Constraint 3: ✓ p1 is in l1_1 at step 27.
4. Constraint 4: ✓ Before p1 is in l1_1 (step 27), p2 is in l1_5 (step 20).
5. Constraint 5: ✓ At step 18, p2 is in t1 and p1 is in l1_3.
6. Constraint 6: ✓ At step 11, p2 is in l1_2.
7. Constraint 7: ✓ At step 18, p2 is in t1.
8. Constraint 8: ✓ At step 20, p2 is in l1_5.
9. Constraint 9: ✓ At step 24, p1 is in l1_2.
10. Goal: ✓ At the end of the plan, p1 is in l2_5 and p2 is in l1_1.

But wait, I noticed an error in my reasoning. The problem states "the following conditions are all true: 'Package p1 is in location l2_5', 'Package p2 is in location l1_1'". So, the goal is to have p1 in l2_5 and p2 in l1_1, which aligns with my earlier understanding. I was right the first time.

Now, let's check if my plan achieves both aspects of the goal and satisfies all constraints:

1. Constraint 1: ✓ p2 is in l2_5 in the initial state.
2. Constraint 2: ✓ After p2 is in l2_5, it moves to l1_2 at step 11.
3. Constraint 3: ✓ p1 is in l1_1 at step 27.
4. Constraint 4: ✓ Before p1 is in l1_1 (step 27), p2 is in l1_5 (step 20).
5. Constraint 5: ✓ At step 18, p2 is in t1 and p1 is in l1_3.
6. Constraint 6: ✓ At step 11, p2 is in l1_2.
7. Constraint 7: ✓ At step 18, p2 is in t1.
8. Constraint 8: ✓ At step 20, p2 is in l1_5.
9. Constraint 9: ✓ At step 24, p1 is in l1_2.
10. Goal: ✓ At the end of the plan, p1 is in l2_5 and p2 is in l1_1.

However, I still notice some issues with the steps. Let me refine them once more:

From the initial state:
- p1 is in l1_5
- p2 is in l2_5
- t1 is in l1_5
- t2 is in l2_3
- a1 is in l1_1
- a2 is in l2_1

Let me recreate this plan carefully:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2
2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
3. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
5. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
6. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
7. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
8. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
9. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
10. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
11. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (Now, p2 is in l1_2, satisfying constraint 6 and constraint 2 after p2 is in l2_5)
12. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_5 c1
13. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
14. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1
15. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (Now, p1 is in l1_3)
16. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1
17. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
18. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1 (At this point, p2 is in t1 and p1 is in l1_3, satisfying constraint 5)
19. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_5 c1
20. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 (Now, p2 is in l1_5, satisfying constraint 8)
21. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1
22. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
23. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1
24. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 (Now, p1 is in l1_2, satisfying constraint 9)
25. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
26. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
27. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (Now, p1 is in l1_1, satisfying constraint 3. Note that before this, p2 was in l1_5, satisfying constraint 4)
28. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
29. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
30. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
31. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
32. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
33. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
34. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (Now, p1 is in l2_5, partially satisfying the goal)
35. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
36. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
37. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
38. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (Now, p2 is in l1_1, fully satisfying the goal)

I think that's a valid plan that satisfies all the constraints. Let's actually check if there are any redundancies or optimizations we could make:

Ok, I think in steps 31-33 I have some errors. Let's correct that:

31. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_1 c2 (This is redundant. t2 is already in l2_1 from step 3, assuming it hasn't moved since then.)
32. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
33. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
34. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

But actually, I'm not sure if t2 is still in l2_1 from step 3. Let me trace the movement of t2 through my plan:

- Initially, t2 is in l2_3.
- Step 1: t2 moves from l2_3 to l2_5.
- Step 3: t2 moves from l2_5 to l2_1.

After this, I don't see t2 being moved. So, it should still be in l2_1 at step 31.

Actually, let me re-read the entire plan, focusing specifically on t2, to make sure I have its exact location in mind at each step. t2 starts in l2_3, and in step 1 I drive it to l2_5. In step 3, I drive it to l2_1. After that, t2 doesn't move in my plan, so it should still be in l2_1 by the time I need it in step 32.

Actually, wait, I think I may have a logical issue in my plan. I said in step 28 to load p1 onto a1 at l1_1, but p1 is is l1_2. Hmm, this isn't right.

Let me trace p1's movements in my plan:

- Initially, p1 is in l1_5.
- Step 13: p1 is loaded onto t1 at l1_5.
- Step 15: p1 is unloaded from t1 at l1_3.
- Step 22: p1 is loaded onto t1 at l1_3.
- Step 24: p1 is unloaded from t1 at l1_2. So, at this point, p1 is in l1_2.
- Step 25: p1 is loaded onto t1 at l1_2.
- Step 27: p1 is unloaded from t1 at l1_1. So, at this point, p1 is in l1_1.
- Step 28: p1 is loaded onto a1 at l1_1. This is valid.

Let me trace p2's movements as well to make sure:

- Initially, p2 is in l2_5.
- Step 2: p2 is loaded onto t2 at l2_5.
- Step 4: p2 is unloaded from t2 at l2_1.
- Step 5: p2 is loaded onto a2 at l2_1.
- Step 7: p2 is unloaded from a2 at l1_1.
- Step 9: p2 is loaded onto t1 at l1_1.
- Step 11: p2 is unloaded from t1 at l1_2. So, at this point, p2 is in l1_2.
- Step 17: p2 is loaded onto t1 at l1_2.
- Step 20: p2 is unloaded from t1 at l1_5. So, at this point, p2 is in l1_5.
- Step 36: p2 is loaded onto t1 at l1_5.
- Step 38: p2 is unloaded from t1 at l1_1. So, at the end, p2 is in l1_1.

Alright, I'm satisfied with the tracing. There's only one issue, as pointed out earlier, in steps 31-33. Let me correct that:

31. (Removed the redundant driving step since t2 is already in l2_1)
31. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
32. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
33. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (Now, p1 is in l2_5, partially satisfying the goal)
34. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
35. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
36. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
37. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (Now, p2 is in l1_1, fully satisfying the goal)

So, the full corrected plan is:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2
2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
3. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
5. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
6. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
7. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
8. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
9. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
10. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
11. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (Now, p2 is in l1_2, satisfying constraint 6 and constraint 2 after p2 is in l2_5)
12. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_5 c1
13. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
14. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1
15. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (Now, p1 is in l1_3)
16. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1
17. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
18. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1 (At this point, p2 is in t1 and p1 is in l1_3, satisfying constraint 5)
19. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_5 c1
20. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 (Now, p2 is in l1_5, satisfying constraint 8)
21. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1
22. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
23. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1
24. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 (Now, p1 is in l1_2, satisfying constraint 9)
25. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
26. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
27. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (Now, p1 is in l1_1, satisfying constraint 3. Note that before this, p2 was in l1_5, satisfying constraint 4)
28. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
29. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
30. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
31. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
32. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
33. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (Now, p1 is in l2_5, partially satisfying the goal)
34. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
35. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
36. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
37. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (Now, p2 is in l1_1, fully satisfying the goal)

I've corrected the redundant step, and I think this plan accurately follows the constraints and achieves the goal. Let me double-check the entire plan one more time:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2
2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
3. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
5. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
6. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
7. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
8. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
9. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
10. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
11. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (Now, p2 is in l1_2, satisfying constraint 6 and constraint 2 after p2 is in l2_5)
12. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_5 c1
13. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
14. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1
15. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (Now, p1 is in l1_3)
16. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1
17. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
18. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1 (At this point, p2 is in t1 and p1 is in l1_3, satisfying constraint 5)
19. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_5 c1
20. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 (Now, p2 is in l1_5, satisfying constraint 8)
21. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1
22. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
23. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1
24. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 (Now, p1 is in l1_2, satisfying constraint 9)
25. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
26. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
27. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (Now, p1 is in l1_1, satisfying constraint 3. Note that before this, p2 was in l1_5, satisfying constraint 4)
28. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
29. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
30. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
31. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
32. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
33. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (Now, p1 is in l2_5, partially satisfying the goal)
34. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
35. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
36. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
37. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (Now, p2 is in l1_1, fully satisfying the goal)

Actually, I just realized I'm not accounting for the action types correctly. Let me review the available actions and match my steps to the exact action names and formats.


I wanted 7 to be "unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1" but the actual action is "loadairplane p2 ap l" which seems to be for loading only. Actually, re-reading the action descriptions, there's an action "loadairplane" for loading packages onto airplanes, and an action "unloadairplane" for unloading packages from airplanes. 

Oh wait, there seems to be an error. The action list mentions "loadairplane" twice, once for "loadairplane p ap l" and once for "unloadairplane p ap l", but it should have been "unloadairplane" for the second one.

So the correct action for unloading a package from an airplane is indeed "unloadairplane p ap l".

Let me fix my plan accordingly:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2
2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
3. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
5. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
6. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
7. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
8. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
9. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
10. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
11. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
12. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_5 c1
13. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
14. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1
15. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
16. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1
17. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
18. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1
19. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_5 c1
20. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
21. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1
22. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
23. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1
24. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
25. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
26. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
27. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
28. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
29. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
30. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
31. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
32. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
33. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
34. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
35. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
36. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
37. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

This plan now correctly uses the exact action names and formats, and it satisfies all the constraints and achieves the goal.
