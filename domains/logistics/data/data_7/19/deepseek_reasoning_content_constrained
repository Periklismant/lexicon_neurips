Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. Hmm, the goal is to get p1 to l2_5 and p2 to l1_1. There are a bunch of constraints to satisfy too. Let me start by understanding the initial state and the required conditions.

First, the initial state: p1 is in l1_5 (city c1), and p2 is in l2_5 (city c2). The trucks and airplanes are in various locations. Trucks can move within their city, airplanes between airports. So, for p1 to get to l2_5 (which is in c2), I probably need to use an airplane. Similarly, p2 needs to go from l2_5 to l1_1 (which is an airport in c1), so again an airplane might be needed.

But let's not get ahead of ourselves. Let's list out all the constraints to make sure we don't miss any. The constraints are:

1. At some state, p2 is in l2_5.
2. If p2 is in l2_5 in some state, then in that state or later, p2 must be in l1_2.
3. At some state, p1 is in l1_1.
4. If p1 is in l1_1, then before that, p2 was in l1_5 or l1_4.
5. At some state, p2 is in t1 and p1 is in l1_3.
6. At some state, either p2 is in l1_2 or p1 is in l2_2.
7. At some state, p2 is in t1.
8. At some state, p2 is in l1_5.
9. At some state, p1 is in l1_2.

That's a lot. Let's map these out step by step.

Starting with the goal: p1 to l2_5 (c2) and p2 to l1_1 (c1). Since cities are separate, moving between them requires airplanes. So for p1: from l1_5 (c1) to some airport in c1 (l1_1), then fly to c2's airport (l2_1), then drive to l2_5. Wait, but l2_5 is in c2, so maybe a truck in c2 can take it there. Similarly, p2 needs to go from l2_5 (c2) to l1_1 (c1), so maybe via l2_1 (airport), fly to l1_1.

But let's think step by step.

First, p1's journey:

Current location: l1_5 (c1). To get to l2_5 (c2), need to:

1. Move p1 from l1_5 to l1_1 (airport in c1). Use a truck in c1. The available trucks are t1 (in l1_5) and t2 (in l2_3, but that's in c2, so not useful for c1). So t1 is in l1_5. Wait, initial state says "Package t1 is in location l1_5" — wait, wait, the objects are trucks t1 and t2. Wait, the original state says "Package t1 is in location l1_5". Wait, that's a mistake. Wait, the user might have made a typo. Because trucks are objects. Wait, looking back: The objects include "truck t1", "truck t2". The original state says "Package t1 is in location l1_5". That's probably a mistake. Because t1 is a truck, not a package. So perhaps it's a typo. The original state should be "Truck t1 is in location l1_5". Similarly for others. Otherwise, the problem is impossible because you can't drive a package as a truck. So assuming that's a typo, let's correct that. So:

Original state:

"Truck t1 is in location l1_5"

"Truck t2 is in location l2_3"

"Airplane a1 is in location l1_1"

"Airplane a2 is in location l2_1"

Packages p1 in l1_5, p2 in l2_5.

Okay, that makes sense. So t1 is in l1_5 (c1), t2 in l2_3 (c2). a1 in l1_1 (c1's airport), a2 in l2_1 (c2's airport).

So for p1 in l1_5 (c1), we need to get it to l2_5 (c2). So steps:

1. Load p1 into t1 at l1_5.

But wait, t1 is already there. So loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5.

Then drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_1 (the airport in c1). Because l1_1 is in c1, so drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1.

Then unload p1 from t1 at l1_1.

Then load p1 into airplane a1 (since a1 is at l1_1).

Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1 (c2's airport).

Then unload p1 from a1 at l2_1.

Then load p1 into truck t2 (which is in l2_3, but need to move it to l2_1 first?) Wait, t2 is in l2_3. So drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1, then load p1 into t2, then drive to l2_5 and unload.

But wait, l2_5 is in c2. So steps for p1:

loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5

drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1

unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

Now, to get p1 to l2_5, need a truck in c2. Truck t2 is in l2_3. So need to drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1 (airport), load p1 into t2, drive to l2_5, unload.

But wait, p1 is at l2_1 after unloading from a1. So:

loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 → but t2 needs to be there. So first drive t2 to l2_1.

drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2

unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

That's the path for p1.

For p2, starting at l2_5 (c2), need to get to l1_1 (c1's airport). So similar steps:

Use truck t2 (in l2_3, but after moving to l2_5? Wait, but t2 might be used for p1 first. Let's see. If we need to handle both p1 and p2, we need to plan their paths without conflicting use of vehicles.

But let's outline p2's path:

p2 is in l2_5. Need to get to l1_1.

So steps:

Load p2 into t2 at l2_5. Wait, t2 is initially in l2_3. So first, drive t2 to l2_5. But if t2 is used for p1, then maybe we need to handle that.

Alternatively, use another truck? But the problem only has t1 and t2. t1 is in c1, t2 in c2.

Wait, after delivering p1, t2 would be in l2_5. So after unloading p1 there, we can load p2 into t2, drive back to l2_1 (airport), unload p2, load into a2, fly to l1_1, then unload.

But let's think step by step.

But let's also consider the constraints. Let's list all the constraints again and see how to satisfy them.

Constraints:

1. p2 in l2_5 at some state. Initially, p2 is already in l2_5. So that's satisfied in the initial state. Wait, but the initial state is before any actions. So maybe the first constraint is already met. But perhaps during the plan, we need to have p2 in l2_5 again. Wait, the problem says "must hold in at least one state". Since the initial state has p2 in l2_5, that's already satisfied. So constraint 1 is met by the initial state. So no action needed for that. But maybe during the plan, p2 might leave l2_5 and come back. Wait, but if the initial state already satisfies it, then we don't need to do anything for that constraint.

But the second constraint says that if in any state p2 is in l2_5, then in that state or later, p2 must be in l1_2. Since the initial state has p2 in l2_5, then according to constraint 2, p2 must be in l1_2 at some state after the initial state. So we need to ensure that after the initial state, p2 eventually reaches l1_2.

Similarly, constraint 3 requires p1 to be in l1_1 at some state. Well, during the plan to move p1 to l1_1 (airport) for loading into airplane, that's already part of the plan. So that will satisfy constraint 3.

Constraint 4: If p1 is in l1_1 (which will happen when we load it into the airplane), then there must be an earlier state where p2 was in l1_5 or l1_4. So before p1 arrives at l1_1, p2 must have been in l1_5 or l1_4 in some prior state. But p2 starts in l2_5 (c2). So how to get p2 into c1's locations l1_5 or l1_4? That requires moving p2 from c2 to c1, which would involve flying. So perhaps p2 needs to be transported to c1 first, then to l1_5 or l1_4, before p1 is moved to l1_1.

But that complicates things. Let me think.

So, the plan for p1 involves moving it to l1_1 (airport) via truck t1. The action of loading p1 into t1 and driving to l1_1 would result in p1 being in l1_1. But according to constraint 4, before that happens, p2 must have been in l1_5 or l1_4.

But p2 is in c2 initially. So we need to move p2 to c1 first. How?

To get p2 to c1, we need to fly it from c2 to c1. So steps for p2:

1. In c2, load p2 into t2 (which is initially in l2_3). So drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_5 (where p2 is). Then load p2 into t2.

Wait, p2 is in l2_5. So:

drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2

loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5

Then drive t2 to l2_1 (airport):

drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2

unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

Now, p2 is in l1_1 (c1's airport). But the goal is to have p2 in l1_1, but according to the problem's goal, that's the desired final state. Wait, no: the goal is to have p1 in l2_5 and p2 in l1_1. So the above steps would get p2 to l1_1, but according to the constraints, before p1 is in l1_1 (when we load it into the airplane), p2 must have been in l1_5 or l1_4.

Wait, but in the plan for p1, we load p1 into t1 in l1_5, drive to l1_1, then load into airplane. So the state where p1 is in l1_1 occurs after unloading from t1. So before that action (unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1), we need to have p2 in l1_5 or l1_4.

But if we first move p2 to c1, say to l1_5, then that would satisfy constraint 4. Let's see.

So maybe the plan has to first move p2 to l1_5 or l1_4, then proceed with moving p1.

But how to get p2 to l1_5 or l1_4. Since p2 starts in c2, we need to fly it to c1's airport (l1_1), then use a truck in c1 (t1) to move it to l1_5 or l1_4.

But t1 is in l1_5 initially. So if we fly p2 to l1_1, then use t1 to drive to l1_1, load p2 into t1, and drive to l1_5. But wait, t1 is already in l1_5. So initial state: t1 is in l1_5.

Wait, initial state: t1 is in l1_5 (c1), which is a location in c1. So to move p2 to l1_5, we can:

1. Fly p2 from c2 to l1_1 (c1's airport).

2. Then use t1 to drive from l1_5 to l1_1 (airport), load p2 into t1, then drive back to l1_5 and unload.

But why would we do that? Because we need to have p2 in l1_5 or l1_4 before p1 is in l1_1.

Wait, but the plan for p1 involves moving it from l1_5 to l1_1. So before that, p1 is loaded into t1 in l1_5, then driven to l1_1. So the state where p1 is in l1_1 (after unloading from t1) would be after the drivetruck and unloadtruck actions.

But constraint 4 says that if p1 is in l1_1 (in any state), then there must be an earlier state where p2 was in l1_5 or l1_4.

So perhaps during the plan, after moving p2 to l1_5 (via airplane and truck), then moving p1 to l1_1, which would satisfy constraint 4.

But this complicates the plan. Let's outline the steps:

First, move p2 to l1_5:

Steps for p2:

1. In c2: load p2 into t2 (which is in l2_3). So drive t2 to l2_5.

drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2

loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5

2. Drive t2 to l2_1 (airport):

drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2

unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

3. Load p2 into a2 (which is in l2_1):

loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

4. Fly a2 to l1_1:

flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

5. Unload p2 from a2 into l1_1:

unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

Now p2 is in l1_1 (c1's airport). But we need to get p2 to l1_5 or l1_4 to satisfy constraint 4. So:

6. Load p2 into t1 (which is in l1_5). Wait, t1 is in l1_5. So need to drive t1 to l1_1 to pick up p2.

drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1

loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1

unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

Now p2 is in l1_5. This satisfies constraint 8 (p2 in l1_5 at some state) and also, when later p1 is in l1_1 (during its transport), the condition for constraint 4 is met (since p2 was in l1_5 earlier).

But this seems like a lot of steps. However, we also need to satisfy other constraints.

Constraint 5: At some state, p2 is in t1 and p1 is in l1_3. So we need to have a state where both conditions hold. Let's see.

p1 starts in l1_5. To get p1 to l1_3, we can use t1. But if t1 is being used to move p2 to l1_5, then perhaps after moving p2 to l1_5, we can move p1 to l1_3.

Wait, after p2 is unloaded at l1_5, t1 is there. Then we can load p1 into t1 (since p1 is in l1_5), drive to l1_3, and unload. That would make p1 in l1_3, and if p2 is in t1 during that time? Wait, no. After unloading p2 in l1_5, t1 is empty. So to have p2 in t1 and p1 in l1_3, perhaps during the transportation of p2 to l1_5, when p2 is loaded into t1, and then before unloading, drive t1 to l1_3 with both packages? Wait, but p1 is in l1_5. So maybe:

After step 5 (unloading p2 into l1_1), then load p2 into t1 at l1_1, drive t1 to l1_3, unload p2 there (but that would not help). Alternatively, during the movement of p2 to l1_5, when p2 is in t1 (after loading into t1 at l1_1), before driving to l1_5, perhaps drive to l1_3 first.

Wait, let's re-examine the steps for p2:

After flying p2 to l1_1 (step 5), then:

6. drivetruck t1 from l1_5 to l1_1 (to pick up p2).

7. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

At this point, p2 is in t1, and t1 is in l1_1. Then, if we drive t1 to l1_3:

8. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1.

9. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3.

But during step 7 and 8, p2 is in t1. Also, after step 7, if we load p1 into t1 as well (but you can only have one package at a time unless the problem allows multiple packages in a truck; but the problem doesn't state that trucks can carry multiple packages, but the actions allow loading and unloading individual packages. So I assume trucks can carry multiple packages. Wait, but the problem doesn't mention capacity, so perhaps we can assume unlimited. So after loading p2 into t1, we can load p1 into t1 as well (since they are both in l1_1? No, p1 is in l1_5 initially. So after step 6 (driving t1 to l1_1), p1 is still in l1_5. So to get p1 into t1, we need to have t1 at l1_5 again.

This is getting complicated. Let's try to outline a plan that satisfies all constraints.

Let's attempt to structure the plan step by step, considering all constraints.

First, handle constraint 4: before p1 is in l1_1, p2 must be in l1_5 or l1_4.

So first, we need to move p2 to l1_5 or l1_4.

To do that:

1. Move p2 from l2_5 (c2) to l2_1 (c2's airport) using t2.

2. Fly p2 to l1_1 (c1's airport).

3. Use t1 (in c1) to move p2 from l1_1 to l1_5 or l1_4.

Let's do that:

Action sequence:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2 (move t2 to p2's location)

2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5

3. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 (move to airport)

4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

5. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

6. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

7. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (now p2 is in l1_1, c1)

8. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1 (t1 moves to airport to pick up p2)

9. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

10. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1 (move back to l1_5)

11. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 (now p2 is in l1_5, satisfying constraint 8 and part of constraint 4)

Now, constraint 4 requires that before p1 is in l1_1, p2 was in l1_5 or l1_4. Since we just moved p2 to l1_5, that's satisfied.

Now, proceed to move p1:

12. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 (t1 is at l1_5 with p2 unloaded)

13. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1 (move to airport)

14. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (now p1 is in l1_1, satisfying constraint 3)

15. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

16. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (c2's airport)

17. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

18. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2 (assuming t2 is at l2_1 from step 4)

Wait, after step 4, t2 is at l2_1. Then steps 5-17 would have t2 still at l2_1. So:

18. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

19. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2

20. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (p1 reaches goal)

Now, moving p2 from l1_5 to l1_1 (goal):

But wait, p2 is in l1_5. Need to get it to l1_1. So:

21. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1 (t1 is at l1_5 after step 14)

Wait, after step 14, t1 is at l1_1. Because after driving from l1_5 to l1_1 (step 13), it's there. Then step 14 unloads p1 there. So t1 is at l1_1. So to move p2 from l1_5 to l1_1, we need to have t1 go back to l1_5.

But p2 is in l1_5. So:

21. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1 (to pick up p2)

22. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

23. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1

24. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (p2 now at goal)

But this would complete both goals.

But we need to check the constraints.

Let's verify each constraint:

1. p2 in l2_5 at some state. Initial state has p2 in l2_5. So satisfied.

2. Whenever p2 is in l2_5, then in that or later state, p2 is in l1_2. But in our plan, after initial state, p2 is moved to l2_1, then to l1_1, then to l1_5, then to l1_1. So the initial state has p2 in l2_5. So after that, we need p2 to reach l1_2. But in our current plan, p2 doesn't go to l1_2. So this constraint is not satisfied. Oops, this is a problem.

So constraint 2 requires that if p2 is ever in l2_5 (which it is in the initial state), then at some state after that, p2 is in l1_2. So we need to have p2 reach l1_2 at some point.

So how to do that? Let's see. Currently, in our plan, p2 goes from l2_5 → l2_1 (via truck) → l1_1 (via airplane) → l1_5 → l1_1. So to get p2 to l1_2, we need to add steps.

For example, after step 11 (p2 in l1_5), perhaps drive t1 to l1_2 and unload p2 there.

But let's adjust the plan.

After step 11: p2 is in l1_5.

To get p2 to l1_2:

12. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 (t1 is at l1_5 after step 10?)

Wait, step 10 is drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1 (after step 9). Then step 11 unloads p2 there. So t1 is at l1_5. So:

12. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

13. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_2 c1

14. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (now p2 is in l1_2, satisfying constraint 6 and 2)

Then proceed with moving p1.

But this complicates the order. Let's reorganize.

Alternative approach:

After moving p2 to l1_5 (step 11), we need to get p2 to l1_2.

So:

12. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

13. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_2 c1

14. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (now p2 is in l1_2. This satisfies constraint 6 (p2 in l1_2) and constraint 2 (after initial state, p2 is in l1_2). Also, constraint 9 requires p1 to be in l1_2 at some state. So p1 needs to be there as well. Hmm.

Wait, constraint 9: p1 is in l1_2 at some state. So in the current plan, p1 is moved from l1_5 to l1_1, then flown to l2_1, etc. So p1 doesn't go to l1_2. So we need to add steps to get p1 to l1_2.

Alternatively, maybe during the movement of p2 to l1_2, we can also move p1 there. But p1 is in l1_5. So let's see.

After step 14 (p2 in l1_2), we can load p1 into t1 (which is at l1_2?), but t1 was at l1_2 after step 13.

Wait, after step 13: drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_2 c1. Then unload p2 there (step 14). So t1 is in l1_2. Then, to move p1, which is in l1_5, we need to get t1 back to l1_5.

But this is getting too complicated. Let's think of a different approach.

Perhaps instead of moving p2 to l1_5, we can move it to l1_4 to satisfy constraint 4, and then to l1_2.

But this adds more steps.

Alternatively, after moving p2 to l1_5 (step 11), then load p2 into t1 again and drive to l1_2.

But how to satisfy all constraints:

Constraint 5: At some state, p2 is in t1 and p1 is in l1_3.

So during the plan, there must be a state where p2 is in t1 and p1 is in l1_3.

So perhaps after moving p2 to l1_5, we load p2 into t1 (which is at l1_5), drive to l1_3, then unload p2 there. But during that time, p1 is still in l1_5. So if we first move p1 to l1_3:

For example:

After step 11 (p2 in l1_5), load p1 into t1 (which is at l1_5):

12. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5

13. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1

14. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (now p1 is in l1_3)

Then, load p2 into t1 (which is in l1_3) but p2 is in l1_5. So that's not possible. Hmm.

Alternatively, during the transport of p2 to l1_5, maybe have a step where p2 is in t1 and p1 is in l1_3.

Wait, perhaps after moving p1 to l1_3 first.

But p1 starts in l1_5. To get to l1_3:

1. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5

2. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1

3. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (now p1 is in l1_3)

Then, we can load p2 into t1 (which is in l1_3?), but p2 is still in l2_5. So this doesn't help.

Alternatively, after moving p2 to l1_5, then move p1 to l1_3 while p2 is in t1.

Wait, let's try this:

After step 11 (p2 in l1_5):

12. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 (now p2 is in t1)

13. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1 (now t1 is in l1_3 with p2)

14. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (p2 in l1_3)

But during step 12 and 13, p2 is in t1. If during that time, p1 is in l1_3, then constraint 5 would be satisfied. But p1 is in l1_5 initially. So we need to get p1 to l1_3 before or during these steps.

Alternatively, perhaps after moving p1 to l1_3 first:

But p1 is in l1_5. So:

12. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5

13. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1

14. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (now p1 in l1_3)

15. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 (but t1 is now in l1_3, so this is impossible unless we drive back.

This is getting too tangled. Let's try to find a sequence that satisfies all constraints.

Let's list all constraints again:

Constraints:

1. p2 in l2_5 at some state (initial state)

2. If p2 in l2_5, then eventually p2 in l1_2 (since initial state has p2 in l2_5, need p2 to reach l1_2)

3. p1 in l1_1 at some state (achieved when moving p1 to airport)

4. If p1 in l1_1, then earlier p2 in l1_5 or l1_4 (satisfied by moving p2 to l1_5 first)

5. Some state has p2 in t1 and p1 in l1_3

6. Some state has p2 in l1_2 or p1 in l2_2

7. Some state has p2 in t1

8. Some state has p2 in l1_5

9. Some state has p1 in l1_2

So, to satisfy all:

- p2 must be in l1_2 (constraint 2 and 6)

- p1 must be in l1_2 (constraint 9)

- p1 must be in l1_3 while p2 is in t1 (constraint 5)

- p2 must be in t1 (constraint 7)

- p2 must be in l1_5 (constraint 8)

So let's try to structure the plan accordingly.

Here's a possible approach:

1. Move p2 to l1_5 via airplane and truck (as before) to satisfy constraints 4 and 8.

2. Move p2 from l1_5 to l1_2 via truck t1 to satisfy constraints 2 and 6.

3. Move p1 from l1_5 to l1_3 via truck t1, while p2 is in t1 (loading p2 into t1 first, then loading p1 into t1 and driving to l1_3. Wait, but trucks can carry multiple packages? Assuming they can, then:

For example:

After p2 is in l1_5 (step 11):

12. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 (now p2 in t1, satisfying constraint 7)

13. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 (p1 in t1)

14. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1

15. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (p1 in l1_3, satisfying constraint 5's p1 part)

16. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (p2 in l1_3)

But this doesn't satisfy constraint 5, which requires p2 to be in t1 and p1 in l1_3. During step 13-14, both are in t1. When we unload p1 first (step 15), p2 is still in t1. So the state after step 15 is p1 in l1_3 and p2 in t1 (which is in l1_3). So that would satisfy constraint 5.

Then, proceed to move p2 to l1_2:

17. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1

18. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (p2 in l1_2, satisfying constraints 2 and 6, 9?)

Wait, constraint 9 requires p1 in l1_2. So p1 is in l1_3 here, not l1_2. So we need to also move p1 to l1_2.

So after step 15, p1 is in l1_3. Need to get p1 to l1_2. Maybe:

19. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (t1 is at l1_3)

But after step 18, t1 is in l1_2. So perhaps after moving p2 to l1_2, drive t1 back to l1_3, load p1, drive to l1_2:

19. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1

20. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3

21. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1

22. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 (now p1 in l1_2, satisfying constraint 9)

But this adds more steps. Then proceed to move p1 to airport.

But this is getting very long. Let's try to outline the entire plan with all constraints satisfied.

Plan Outline:

1. Move p2 from l2_5 to l1_5 (via t2, a2, t1).

   - Steps 1-11 as before.

2. Load p2 into t1, drive to l1_3, unload p2 (now p2 in l1_3, t1 in l1_3).

   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 (step 12)

   - drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1 (step 13)

   - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (step 14)

3. Load p1 into t1, drive to l1_3 (p1 was in l1_5; need to drive t1 back to l1_5).

   - drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_5 c1 (step 15)

   - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 (step 16)

   - drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1 (step 17)

   - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (step 18) → now p1 in l1_3

But during step 16-17, both p1 and p2 (if p2 is loaded?) are in t1. Wait, p2 was unloaded in step 14. So during step 16, t1 is empty. So this just moves p1 to l1_3. But we need to satisfy constraint 5 (p2 in t1 and p1 in l1_3). So maybe:

After step 14 (p2 in l1_3), load p2 back into t1:

15. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (now p2 in t1)

16. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (but p1 is in l1_5; can't load from there. So this won't work.

Alternative approach: When moving p2 from l1_5 to l1_3, have p1 loaded at the same time.

But p1 is in l1_5. So:

12. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 (p2 in t1)

13. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 (p1 in t1)

14. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1 (both packages in t1)

15. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (p1 in l1_3)

16. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (p2 in l1_3)

Now, during step 14, both are in t1. After unloading p1, p2 is still in t1. So the state after step 15 has p2 in t1 and p1 in l1_3. This satisfies constraint 5.

Then, proceed to move p2 to l1_2:

17. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1

18. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (p2 in l1_2)

Now, constraint 2 is satisfied (p2 in l1_2 after initial state). Also, constraint 6 (p2 in l1_2).

Then, move p1 to l1_2:

19. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (but p1 is in l1_3, t1 is in l1_2. So need to drive t1 back to l1_3 first.)

Wait, after step 18, t1 is in l1_2. So:

19. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1

20. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3

21. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1

22. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 (now p1 in l1_2, satisfying constraint 9)

Now, p1 is in l1_2. Then proceed to move p1 to l1_1:

23. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1

24. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (now p1 in l1_1, satisfying constraint 3)

Then load p1 into airplane a1 and fly to l2_1, then truck to l2_5.

Similarly, move p2 from l1_2 to l1_1:

But p2 is in l1_2. So:

25. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

26. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1

27. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (now p2 at goal)

This would complete both goals.

But this plan is very long. Let's check all constraints:

1. p2 in l2_5: initial state.

2. p2 in l1_2 after initial state: yes (step 18).

3. p1 in l1_1: step 24.

4. Before p1 in l1_1 (step 24), p2 was in l1_5 (step 11).

5. State where p2 in t1 and p1 in l1_3: step 15 (after unloading p1, p2 is still in t1. So during step 15, p1 is in l1_3 and p2 is in t1.

6. p2 in l1_2 (step 18).

7. p2 in t1: steps 12, 15, 25.

8. p2 in l1_5: step 11.

9. p1 in l1_2: step 22.

So all constraints are satisfied.

Now, let's write out the full action sequence with all these steps.

But also, we need to handle the transportation of p1 to l2_5 and p2 to l1_1.

Continuing the plan after step 27 (p2 in l1_1), which is the goal for p2.

For p1:

After step 24, p1 is in l1_1.

Then:

25. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

26. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

27. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

28. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2 (t2 starts in l2_3)

29. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

30. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2

31. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (p1 at goal)

So combining all steps:

But need to integrate all steps correctly. Let's compile the entire plan.

Full Plan Steps:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2

2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5

3. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2

4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

5. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

6. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

7. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

8. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1

9. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

10. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1

11. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

12. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

13. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5

14. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1

15. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3

16. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

17. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1

18. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

19. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1

20. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3

21. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1

22. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2

23. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1

24. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

25. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

26. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

27. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

28. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2 (wait, t2 was at l2_1 after step 4. After step 3, t2 is at l2_1. But step 4 unloads p2 there. Then steps 5-27 involve other actions. So t2 is still at l2_1 after step 4. So step 28 should be drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2.

But wait, after step 3, t2 is at l2_1. Then step 4 unloads p2 there. So t2 remains at l2_1.

So:

28. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

29. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2

30. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

For p2, after step 18, it's in l1_2. Then:

19. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

20. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1

21. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

But wait, in the previous outline, steps 19-21 were for moving p1. This is getting confusing. Let's reorganize.

Perhaps a better approach is to list all actions in order, ensuring that all steps are correctly sequenced.

Final plan steps:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2 (move t2 to p2's location)

2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 (load p2 into t2)

3. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 (drive t2 to airport)

4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (unload p2 at airport)

5. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (load p2 into a2)

6. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (fly to c1's airport)

7. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (unload p2 at l1_1)

8. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1 (drive t1 to airport to pick up p2)

9. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (load p2 into t1)

10. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1 (drive back to l1_5)

11. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 (unload p2 at l1_5)

12. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 (load p2 into t1 again)

13. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 (load p1 into t1)

14. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1 (drive to l1_3)

15. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (unload p1 at l1_3)

16. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (unload p2 at l1_3)

17. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1 (drive to l1_2)

18. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (unload p2 at l1_2)

19. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1 (drive back to l1_3 to pick up p1)

20. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (load p1 into t1)

21. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1 (drive to l1_2)

22. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 (unload p1 at l1_2)

23. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 (drive to airport)

24. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (unload p1 at airport)

25. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (load p1 into a1)

26. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (fly to c2's airport)

27. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 (unload p1 at l2_1)

28. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2 (drive t2 to l2_5)

29. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (load p1 into t2)

30. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2 (drive to l2_5)

31. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (unload p1 at goal)

For p2 to reach l1_1:

32. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (load p2 into t1 at l1_2)

33. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 (drive to l1_1)

34. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (unload p2 at goal)

This is a very long plan. But I'm not sure if there's a shorter way. Also, the problem asks for an optimal plan (shortest possible). Maybe there's a shorter path.

Alternative approach: Realize that some steps can be optimized.

For example, after step 11 (p2 in l1_5), can we load p1 and p2 into t1, drive to l1_3, unload p1, then drive to l1_2, unload p2, then proceed.

But let's see:

1. After step 11:

12. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

13. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5

14. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1

15. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (p1 in l1_3, p2 still in t1)

16. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1

17. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (p2 in l1_2)

Now, constraint 5 is satisfied during step 15 (p2 in t1, p1 in l1_3).

Then move p1 to l1_2:

18. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3

But t1 is in l1_2 after step 17. So need to drive back:

18. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1

19. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3

20. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1

21. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 (p1 in l1_2)

Then proceed to move p1 to l1_1:

22. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1

23. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (p1 in l1_1)

Then load into airplane and fly.

Similarly, move p2 to l1_1:

24. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

25. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1

26. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

This reduces the steps but still is lengthy.

However, given the complexity of constraints, this might be the optimal plan. But perhaps there's a shorter way.

Another observation: The constraint 6 requires that either p2 is in l1_2 or p1 is in l2_2 at some state. If we can get p1 to l2_2, that would also satisfy constraint 6. But moving p1 to l2_2 would require additional steps. It's probably easier to get p2 to l1_2.

Given all this, the plan outlined above seems to satisfy all constraints. However, it's quite long. Let's check if any steps can be merged or optimized.

For example, after step 17 (p2 in l1_2), perhaps drive t1 to l1_1 directly with p2:

18. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

19. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1

20. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (p2 at goal)

This would handle p2's movement earlier, but we still need to move p1 to l1_2.

But in this case, p1 is still in l1_3. So:

21. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1

22. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3

23. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1

24. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2

Then proceed to move p1 to l1_1 again.

This seems redundant. So perhaps the earlier plan is the most efficient possible given the constraints.

Given the time constraints and the complexity, I'll proceed to outline the final plan as per the initial outline, making sure all constraints are met.
