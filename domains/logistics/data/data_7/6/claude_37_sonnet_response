Let me understand the problem.

We have:
- Two cities, c1 and c2, each with multiple locations including an airport.
- Locations l1_1, l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5 are in city c1, with l1_1 being the airport.
- Locations l2_1, l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5 are in city c2, with l2_1 being the airport.
- Two packages, p1 and p2.
- Two trucks, t1 and t2.
- Two airplanes, a1 and a2.

Wait, there seems to be a mistake in the initial state description. It says "Package t1 is in location l1_4" and "Package t2 is in location l2_1", but t1 and t2 are trucks, not packages. Similarly, it says "Package a1 is in location l1_1" and "Package a2 is in location l2_1", but a1 and a2 are airplanes. I'll correct this by assuming that trucks and airplanes are correctly positioned as described:

Initial State:
- Locations l1_1 through l1_5 are in city c1, with l1_1 being the airport.
- Locations l2_1 through l2_5 are in city c2, with l2_1 being the airport.
- Truck t1 is in location l1_4 (city c1)
- Truck t2 is in location l2_1 (city c2, airport)
- Package p1 is in location l2_3 (city c2)
- Package p2 is in location l2_5 (city c2)
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (city c1, airport)
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1 (city c2, airport)

Goal:
- Package p1 is in location l2_4 (city c2)
- Package p2 is in location l2_1 (city c2, airport)

Now let's analyze the constraints:

1. "Package p2 is in location l2_1" must be true at some point (this is part of the goal).
2. Before p2 reaches l2_1, there must be a state where either "p2 is in l1_4" or "p1 is in l2_5" is true.
3. "Package p1 is in location l1_3" must be true at some point.
4. "Package p2 is in location l2_2" must be true at some point.
5. "Package p2 is in location l2_5" must be true at some point (this is the initial state of p2).
6. If p2 is in l2_5, then p1 must also be in l2_5 either at the same time or later.
7. There must be a state where "p2 is in l2_2" and "p1 is in t1" are both true.
8. There must be a state where either "p1 is in a2" or "p2 is in a1" is true.
9. There must be a state where "p2 is in l1_1" and "p1 is in t1" are both true.

Let's try to construct a plan that satisfies all these constraints and achieves the goal.

First, let's note that to satisfy constraint 6, p1 needs to be in l2_5 at some point (because p2 starts in l2_5). And to satisfy constraint 2, p1 needs to be in l2_5 before p2 reaches l2_1.

Let's start by thinking backwards from the goal:
- Package p1 needs to be moved from l2_3 to l2_4.
- Package p2 needs to be moved from l2_5 to l2_1.

And we have several intermediate conditions that must be satisfied.

Let me try to sketch a plan:

1. First, let's satisfy constraint 5: p2 is in l2_5 (this is already true in the initial state).
2. To satisfy constraint 6, we need to move p1 to l2_5. We'll use truck t2 for this:
   - Move t2 from l2_1 to l2_3 to pick up p1.
   - Load p1 into t2 at l2_3.
   - Move t2 from l2_3 to l2_5.
   - Unload p1 from t2 at l2_5.
3. Now both p1 and p2 are in l2_5, satisfying constraint 6.
4. To satisfy constraint 4, we need to move p2 to l2_2:
   - Load p2 into t2 at l2_5.
   - Move t2 from l2_5 to l2_2.
   - Unload p2 from t2 at l2_2.
5. To satisfy constraint 7, we need p1 to be in t1 while p2 is in l2_2. t1 is in l1_4 initially, so we need to move it to where p1 is (l2_5):
   - Move t1 from l1_4 to l1_1 (airport in city c1).
   - Use airplane a1 to move t1 to city c2's airport:
     - Load t1 into a1 at l1_1.
     - Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
     - Unload t1 from a1 at l2_1.
   - Move t1 from l2_1 to l2_5.
   - Load p1 into t1 at l2_5.
   Now p1 is in t1, and p2 is in l2_2, satisfying constraint 7.

Wait, I've made a mistake. Trucks and airplanes can't be loaded into each other in this domain. Trucks can only transport packages, and airplanes can only transport packages as well. So I need to revise my plan.

Let me try again:

1. First, let's satisfy constraint 5: p2 is in l2_5 (this is already true in the initial state).
2. To satisfy constraint 6, we need to move p1 to l2_5. We'll use truck t2 for this:
   - Move t2 from l2_1 to l2_3 to pick up p1.
   - Load p1 into t2 at l2_3.
   - Move t2 from l2_3 to l2_5.
   - Unload p1 from t2 at l2_5.
3. Now both p1 and p2 are in l2_5, satisfying constraint 6.
4. To satisfy constraint 4, we need to move p2 to l2_2:
   - Load p2 into t2 at l2_5.
   - Move t2 from l2_5 to l2_2.
   - Unload p2 from t2 at l2_2.
5. To satisfy constraint 7, we need p1 to be in t1 while p2 is in l2_2. t1 is in l1_4 initially, so we need to move it to where p1 is (l2_5):
   - Move t1 from l1_4 to l1_1 (airport in city c1).
   - Move t1 (empty) from city c1 to city c2.
     - Actually, this isn't possible. Trucks can only move within a city, not between cities.

I need to rethink this. Let's revise our understanding of constraint 7:
"The following conditions are all true: "Package p2 is in location l2_2", "Package p1 is in t1""

So at some point p2 must be in l2_2 and p1 must be in t1. But t1 is in city c1, and p1 is in city c2. To move p1 to t1, we'd need to:
1. Move p1 to airport l2_1 using truck t2.
2. Load p1 into airplane a2 (which is at l2_1).
3. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
4. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1.
5. Move t1 from l1_4 to l1_1.
6. Load p1 into t1 at l1_1.

Now, to satisfy constraint 9:
"The following conditions are all true: "Package p2 is in location l1_1", "Package p1 is in t1""

So p2 must be in l1_1 and p1 must be in t1. This means we also need to move p2 from city c2 to city c1, similar to how we moved p1.

For constraint 8:
"At least one of the following conditions is true: "Package p1 is in a2", "Package p2 is in a1""

So either p1 must be in airplane a2 or p2 must be in airplane a1 at some point.

For constraint 3:
"Package p1 is in location l1_3" must be true at some point.

So after moving p1 to t1, we'd need to drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_3 and unload p1 there.

There's a complex sequence of actions needed to satisfy all these constraints. Let me try to construct a plan step by step.

Starting from the initial state:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_4 (city c1)
- Truck t2 is in location l2_1 (city c2, airport)
- Package p1 is in location l2_3 (city c2)
- Package p2 is in location l2_5 (city c2)
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (city c1, airport)
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1 (city c2, airport)

First, we need to satisfy constraint 6. We've already satisfied constraint 5 since p2 is in l2_5 initially. We need to move p1 to l2_5:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2 (Move truck t2 from airport l2_1 to l2_3 to pick up p1)
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (Load p1 into t2 at l2_3)
3. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2 (Move truck t2 from l2_3 to l2_5)
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (Unload p1 from t2 at l2_5)

Now, both p1 and p2 are in l2_5, satisfying constraint 6.

Next, we need to satisfy constraint 4 by moving p2 to l2_2:

5. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 (Load p2 into t2 at l2_5)
6. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2 (Move truck t2 from l2_5 to l2_2)
7. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (Unload p2 from t2 at l2_2)

Now p2 is in l2_2.

To satisfy constraint 7, we need p1 to be in t1 while p2 is in l2_2. t1 is in l1_4 in city c1, so we need to move p1 to city c1:

8. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2 (Move truck t2 back to l2_5 to pick up p1)
9. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (Load p1 into t2 at l2_5)
10. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 (Move truck t2 to the airport l2_1)
11. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (Unload p1 at airport l2_1)
12. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (Load p1 into airplane a2 at l2_1)

This satisfies part of constraint 8 (p1 is in a2).

13. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1)
14. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1)

Now we need to get p1 into t1:

15. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 (Move truck t1 from l1_4 to l1_1)
16. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (Load p1 into t1 at l1_1)

Now p1 is in t1, but p2 is in l2_2, not in l1_1 as required by constraint 9. For constraint 9, we need to move p2 to l1_1:

17. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2 (Move truck t2 to l2_2 to pick up p2)
18. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (Load p2 into t2 at l2_2)
19. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 (Move truck t2 to the airport l2_1)
20. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (Unload p2 at airport l2_1)
21. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (Load p2 into airplane a2 at l2_1)
22. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1)
23. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1)

Now p2 is in l1_1 and p1 is in t1, satisfying constraint 9.

To satisfy constraint 3, we need to move p1 to l1_3:

24. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1 (Move truck t1 from l1_1 to l1_3)
25. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (Unload p1 from t1 at l1_3)

Now to satisfy constraint 2, we need either "p2 is in l1_4" or "p1 is in l2_5" before "p2 is in l2_1" (which will be part of the final state).

We've already had p1 in l2_5 (step 4), so constraint 2 is satisfied.

Finally, we need to achieve the goal state:
- Package p1 is in location l2_4 (city c2)
- Package p2 is in location l2_1 (city c2, airport)

p2 is currently in l1_1, and p1 is in l1_3. We need to move them to their respective goal locations:

For p1:
26. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1 (Move truck t1 from l1_3 to l1_1)
27. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (Load p1 into t1 at l1_3)
28. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1 (Move truck t1 to the airport l1_1)
29. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (Unload p1 at airport l1_1)
30. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (Load p1 into airplane a1 at l1_1)
31. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1)
32. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 (Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1)
33. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (Load p1 into t2 at l2_1)
34. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2 (Move truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_4)
35. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (Unload p1 from t2 at l2_4)

For p2:
36. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (Load p2 into t1 at l1_1)
37. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1 (Move truck t1 from l1_1 to l1_4)

This satisfies the part of constraint 2 that requires "p2 is in l1_4".

38. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 (Move truck t1 back to l1_1)
39. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1)
40. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (Load p2 into airplane a1 at l1_1)

This satisfies the other part of constraint 8 (p2 is in a1).

41. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1)
42. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (Unload p2 from a1 at l2_1)

Now p2 is in l2_1 (satisfying part of the goal and constraint 1), and p1 is in l2_4 (satisfying the other part of the goal).

Wait, there are some errors in my plan. Let me review and correct them:

First, I can't load p1 into t1 at l1_3 in step 27 because p1 is already in l1_3 (unloaded in step 25). Let me correct the plan:

Starting from step 25:
- p1 is in l1_3
- p2 is in l1_1

25. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (Load p1 into t1 at l1_3)
26. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1 (Move truck t1 to the airport l1_1)
27. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (Unload p1 at airport l1_1)
28. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (Load p1 into airplane a1 at l1_1)
29. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1)
30. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 (Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1)
31. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (Load p1 into t2 at l2_1)
32. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2 (Move truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_4)
33. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (Unload p1 from t2 at l2_4)

For p2:
34. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (Load p2 into t1 at l1_1)
35. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1 (Move truck t1 from l1_1 to l1_4)

This satisfies the part of constraint 2 that requires "p2 is in l1_4".

36. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 (Move truck t1 back to l1_1)
37. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1)
38. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (Load p2 into airplane a1 at l1_1)

This satisfies the other part of constraint 8 (p2 is in a1).

39. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1)
40. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (Unload p2 from a1 at l2_1)

Now p2 is in l2_1 (satisfying part of the goal and constraint 1), and p1 is in l2_4 (satisfying the other part of the goal).

Let me review the entire plan to ensure it's correct and satisfies all constraints:

Initial State:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_4 (city c1)
- Truck t2 is in location l2_1 (city c2, airport)
- Package p1 is in location l2_3 (city c2)
- Package p2 is in location l2_5 (city c2)
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (city c1, airport)
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1 (city c2, airport)

Plan:
1. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2 (Move truck t2 from airport l2_1 to l2_3 to pick up p1)
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (Load p1 into t2 at l2_3)
3. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2 (Move truck t2 from l2_3 to l2_5)
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (Unload p1 from t2 at l2_5)

Now, both p1 and p2 are in l2_5, satisfying constraint 6.

5. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 (Load p2 into t2 at l2_5)
6. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2 (Move truck t2 from l2_5 to l2_2)
7. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (Unload p2 from t2 at l2_2)

Now p2 is in l2_2, satisfying constraint 4.

8. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2 (Move truck t2 back to l2_5 to pick up p1)
9. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (Load p1 into t2 at l2_5)
10. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 (Move truck t2 to the airport l2_1)
11. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (Unload p1 at airport l2_1)
12. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (Load p1 into airplane a2 at l2_1)

This satisfies part of constraint 8 (p1 is in a2).

13. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1)
14. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1)

Now we need to get p1 into t1:

15. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 (Move truck t1 from l1_4 to l1_1)
16. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (Load p1 into t1 at l1_1)

Let's check constraint 7: "The following conditions are all true: "Package p2 is in location l2_2", "Package p1 is in t1""

p2 is in l2_2 (after step 7), and p1 is in t1 (after step 16). But they are not in this state simultaneously. After step 16, p2 is no longer in l2_2, complicating matters.

I need to rethink this. Let's revise the plan to ensure p1 gets into t1 while p2 is still in l2_2:

Instead of having t2 pick up p1 right after dropping off p2, we'll have p1 transported to city c1 independently.

After step 7:
8. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (Load p1 into airplane a2 at l2_1)
9. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1)
10. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1)
11. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 (Move truck t1 from l1_4 to l1_1)
12. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (Load p1 into t1 at l1_1)

Wait, I still have the issue of how to get p1 from l2_5 to l2_1 without using t2, which is still at l2_2 with p2.

Actually, let's revise step 7 and onwards. After step 6:
7. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 (Move truck t2 from l2_2 to l2_1 without unloading p2)
8. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2 (Move truck t2 to l2_5 to pick up p1)
9. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (Load p1 into t2 at l2_5)
10. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2 (Move truck t2 back to l2_2)
11. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (Now unload p2 at l2_2)

Now p2 is in l2_2.

12. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 (Move truck t2 back to l2_1)
13. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (Unload p1 at airport l2_1)
14. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (Load p1 into airplane a2 at l2_1)
15. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1)
16. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1)
17. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 (Move truck t1 from l1_4 to l1_1)
18. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (Load p1 into t1 at l1_1)

This doesn't work either, since at step 10, p2 is in t2, not in l2_2. So constraint 7 isn't satisfied.

Let's start from scratch and re-examine the constraints:

1. "Package p2 is in location l2_1" must be true at some point (this is part of the goal).
2. Before p2 reaches l2_1, there must be a state where either "p2 is in l1_4" or "p1 is in l2_5" is true.
3. "Package p1 is in location l1_3" must be true at some point.
4. "Package p2 is in location l2_2" must be true at some point.
5. "Package p2 is in location l2_5" must be true at some point (this is the initial state of p2).
6. If p2 is in l2_5, then p1 must also be in l2_5 either at the same time or later.
7. There must be a state where "p2 is in l2_2" and "p1 is in t1" are both true.
8. There must be a state where either "p1 is in a2" or "p2 is in a1" is true.
9. There must be a state where "p2 is in l1_1" and "p1 is in t1" are both true.

Given these constraints, and considering the initial state, let's try to construct a plan step by step.

Initial State:
- t1 is in l1_4 (city c1)
- t2 is in l2_1 (city c2, airport)
- p1 is in l2_3 (city c2)
- p2 is in l2_5 (city c2)
- a1 is in l1_1 (city c1, airport)
- a2 is in l2_1 (city c2, airport)

Here's a plan:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2 (Move truck t2 from airport l2_1 to l2_3 to pick up p1)
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (Load p1 into t2 at l2_3)
3. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2 (Move truck t2 from l2_3 to l2_5)
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (Unload p1 from t2 at l2_5)

Now, both p1 and p2 are in l2_5, satisfying constraint 6.

5. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 (Load p2 into t2 at l2_5)
6. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2 (Move truck t2 from l2_5 to l2_2)
7. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (Unload p2 from t2 at l2_2)

Now p2 is in l2_2, satisfying constraint 4.

8. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2 (Move truck t2 back to l2_5 to pick up p1)
9. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (Load p1 into t2 at l2_5)
10. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 (Move truck t2 to the airport l2_1)
11. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (Unload p1 at airport l2_1)
12. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (Load p1 into airplane a2 at l2_1)

This satisfies part of constraint 8 (p1 is in a2).

13. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1)
14. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1)
15. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 (Move truck t1 from l1_4 to l1_1)
16. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (Load p1 into t1 at l1_1)

Now, let's handle constraint 7. We need a state where p2 is in l2_2 and p1 is in t1. The problem is that at step 16, p1 is in t1, but p2 is no longer in l2_2 (it was moved earlier).

Let me rethink the order of operations. I need to carefully consider the steps to ensure that all constraints are satisfied.

Wait, I need to ensure that p2 is in l2_2 and p1 is in t1 simultaneously. Let's think about this:

1. After step 7, p2 is in l2_2.
2. At step 16, p1 is in t1.

But between steps 7 and 16, several other things happen, making it impossible for both conditions to be true at the same time.

To fix this, let's rearrange the plan. Initial steps 1 to 7 remain the same. Then, p1 should leave l2_5 via a2, and then t1 should pick up p1 in city c1 while p2 is still in l2_2.

Let me revise the plan:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2 (Move truck t2 from airport l2_1 to l2_3 to pick up p1)
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (Load p1 into t2 at l2_3)
3. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2 (Move truck t2 from l2_3 to l2_5)
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (Unload p1 from t2 at l2_5)

Now, both p1 and p2 are in l2_5, satisfying constraint 6.

5. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 (Move truck t2 to the airport l2_1)
6. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1)
7. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 (Move truck t1 from l1_4 to l1_1)
8. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1 (Fly a2 back to l2_1)
9. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2 (Move truck t2 back to l2_5)
10. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (Load p1 into t2 at l2_5)
11. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 (Move truck t2 to the airport l2_1 with p1)
12. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (Unload p1 at airport l2_1)
13. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (Load p1 into airplane a2 at l2_1)
14. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1 with p1)
15. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1)
16. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (Load p1 into t1 at l1_1)

Now, we need to have p2 in l2_2 while p1 is in t1. Since p2 is still in l2_5:

17. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2 (Move truck t2 back to l2_5)
18. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 (Load p2 into t2 at l2_5)
19. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2 (Move truck t2 from l2_5 to l2_2)
20. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (Unload p2 from t2 at l2_2)

Now, p2 is in l2_2 (satisfying constraint 4) and p1 is in t1, satisfying constraint 7.

But I've run into another issue: I need to satisfy constraint 9, which requires a state where p2 is in l1_1 and p1 is in t1.

Let's continue the plan:

21. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 (Move truck t2 from l2_2 to l2_1)
22. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (Load p2 into t2 at l2_2)
23. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 (Move truck t2 to the airport l2_1)
24. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (Unload p2 at airport l2_1)
25. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (Load p2 into airplane a2 at l2_1)
26. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1 with p2)
27. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1)

Now, p2 is in l1_1 and p1 is in t1, satisfying constraint 9.

To satisfy constraint 3, we need p1 to be in l1_3 at some point:

28. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1 (Move truck t1 from l1_1 to l1_3)
29. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (Unload p1 from t1 at l1_3)

Now, p1 is in l1_3, satisfying constraint 3.

To satisfy constraint 2, we need either "p2 is in l1_4" or "p1 is in l2_5" before "p2 is in l2_1" (which is part of the goal).

We've already had p1 in l2_5 (step 4), so constraint 2 is satisfied. But for additional coverage, let's also have p2 in l1_4:

30. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (Load p2 into t1 at l1_1)
31. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1 (Move truck t1 from l1_1 to l1_4)

Now p2 is in l1_4, providing another way for constraint 2 to be satisfied.

32. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 (Move truck t1 back to l1_1)
33. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1)
34. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (Load p2 into airplane a1 at l1_1)

This satisfies the other part of constraint 8 (p2 is in a1).

35. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1)
36. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (Unload p2 from a1 at l2_1)

Now p2 is in l2_1, satisfying constraint 1 and part of the goal.

Finally, to complete the goal, we need to get p1 from l1_3 to l2_4:

37. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1 (Move truck t1 from l1_1 to l1_3)
38. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (Load p1 into t1 at l1_3)
39. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1 (Move truck t1 from l1_3 to l1_1)
40. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1)
41. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (Load p1 into airplane a1 at l1_1)
42. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1)
43. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 (Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1)
44. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (Load p1 into t2 at l2_1)
45. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2 (Move truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_4)
46. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (Unload p1 from t2 at l2_4)

Now, p1 is in l2_4 and p2 is in l2_1, achieving the goal!

But I'm concerned about some steps in my plan. Let me re-evaluate steps 22-23:

21. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 (Move truck t2 from l2_2 to l2_1)
22. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (Load p2 into t2 at l2_2)

This doesn't make sense because t2 is in l2_1, not l2_2. The action "loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2" requires both p2 and t2 to be in location l2_2. Let me correct this:

21. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 (Move truck t2 from l2_2 to l2_1)

Actually, at this point, p2 is in l2_2 and t2 is now in l2_1. To pick up p2, t2 needs to go back to l2_2:

21. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2 (Move truck t2 back to l2_2)
22. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (Load p2 into t2 at l2_2)
23. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 (Move truck t2 to the airport l2_1)
24. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (Unload p2 at airport l2_1)

Let me update my plan:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2 (Move truck t2 from airport l2_1 to l2_3 to pick up p1)
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (Load p1 into t2 at l2_3)
3. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2 (Move truck t2 from l2_3 to l2_5)
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (Unload p1 from t2 at l2_5)

Now, both p1 and p2 are in l2_5, satisfying constraint 6.

5. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 (Move truck t2 to the airport l2_1)
6. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1)
7. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 (Move truck t1 from l1_4 to l1_1)
8. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1 (Fly a2 back to l2_1)
9. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2 (Move truck t2 back to l2_5)
10. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (Load p1 into t2 at l2_5)
11. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 (Move truck t2 to the airport l2_1 with p1)
12. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (Unload p1 at airport l2_1)
13. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (Load p1 into airplane a2 at l2_1)
14. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1 with p1)
15. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1)
16. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (Load p1 into t1 at l1_1)

Now, we need to have p2 in l2_2 while p1 is in t1. Since p2 is still in l2_5:

17. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2 (Move truck t2 back to l2_5)
18. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 (Load p2 into t2 at l2_5)
19. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2 (Move truck t2 from l2_5 to l2_2)
20. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (Unload p2 from t2 at l2_2)

Now, p2 is in l2_2 (satisfying constraint 4) and p1 is in t1, satisfying constraint 7.

To satisfy constraint 9, we need p2 in l1_1 while p1 is in t1:

21. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 (Move truck t2 from l2_2 to l2_1)
22. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 c2 (This is wrong...)

I made an error there. At this point, t2 is in l2_1 and p2 is in l2_2. To load p2 into t2, t2 must go back to l2_2:

21. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2 (Move truck t2 back to l2_2)
22. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (Load p2 into t2 at l2_2)
23. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 (Move truck t2 to the airport l2_1)
24. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (Unload p2 at airport l2_1)
25. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (Load p2 into airplane a2 at l2_1)
26. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1 with p2)
27. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1)

Now, p2 is in l1_1 and p1 is in t1, satisfying constraint 9.

To satisfy constraint 3, we need p1 to be in l1_3 at some point:

28. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1 (Move truck t1 from l1_1 to l1_3)
29. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (Unload p1 from t1 at l1_3)

Now, p1 is in l1_3, satisfying constraint 3.

To satisfy constraint 2, we need either "p2 is in l1_4" or "p1 is in l2_5" before "p2 is in l2_1" (which is part of the goal).

We've already had p1 in l2_5, so constraint 2 is satisfied. But for additional coverage, let's also have p2 in l1_4:

30. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (Load p2 into t1 at l1_1)
31. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1 (Move truck t1 from l1_1 to l1_4)

Now p2 is in l1_4, providing another way for constraint 2 to be satisfied.

32. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 (Move truck t1 back to l1_1)
33. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1)
34. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (Load p2 into airplane a1 at l1_1)

This satisfies the other part of constraint 8 (p2 is in a1).

35. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1)
36. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (Unload p2 from a1 at l2_1)

Now p2 is in l2_1, satisfying constraint 1 and part of the goal.

Finally, to complete the goal, we need to get p1 from l1_3 to l2_4:

37. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1 (Move truck t1 from l1_1 to l1_3)
38. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (Load p1 into t1 at l1_3)
39. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1 (Move truck t1 from l1_3 to l1_1)
40. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1)
41. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (Load p1 into airplane a1 at l1_1)
42. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1)
43. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 (Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1)
44. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (Load p1 into t2 at l2_1)
45. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2 (Move truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_4)
46. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (Unload p1 from t2 at l2_4)

Now, p1 is in l2_4 and p2 is in l2_1, achieving the goal!

I'm noticing how some of my steps are not actually optimal or required. Let's review the plan again for optimality:

1. we need to move p2 from l2_5 to l2_1 and p1 from l2_3 to l2_4.
2. we have to ensure all constraints are met.

Let me see if I can optimize the plan further:

Wait, I just realized there's an issue with my understanding of the domain. I'm incorrectly viewing airports as a type of location. Instead, as per the domain description, airports *are* locations, and airplanes can only move between airports.

So, to clarify:
- Location l1_1 is an airport in city c1.
- Location l2_1 is an airport in city c2.

Now, let's get back to the planning. Given the simplification, here's an optimized plan:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2 (Move truck t2 from airport l2_1 to l2_3)
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (Load p1 into t2 at l2_3)
3. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2 (Move truck t2 to l2_5)
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (Unload p1 at l2_5)

Now, both p1 and p2 are in l2_5, satisfying constraint 6.

5. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 (Load p2 into t2 at l2_5)
6. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2 (Move truck t2 to l2_2)
7. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (Unload p2 at l2_2)

Now p2 is in l2_2, satisfying constraint 4.

To satisfy constraint 7, we need p1 to be in t1 while p2 is in l2_2. Let's move p1 to city c1 and into t1:

8. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2 (Move truck t2 back to l2_5)
9. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (Load p1 into t2 at l2_5)
10. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 (Move truck t2 to airport l2_1)
11. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (Unload p1 at airport l2_1)
12. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (Load p1 into airplane a2)
13. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (Fly a2 to airport l1_1)
14. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (Unload p1 at airport l1_1)
15. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 (Move truck t1 to airport l1_1)
16. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (Load p1 into t1)

Now, p1 is in t1 while p2 is in l2_2, satisfying constraint 7.

To satisfy constraint 9, we need p2 to be in l1_1 while p1 is in t1. Let's move p2 to city c1:

17. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2 (Move truck t2 back to l2_2)
18. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (Load p2 into t2 at l2_2)
19. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 (Move truck t2 to airport l2_1)
20. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (Unload p2 at airport l2_1)
21. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (Load p2 into airplane a2)
22. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (Fly a2 to airport l1_1)
23. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (Unload p2 at airport l1_1)

Now, p2 is in l1_1 and p1 is in t1, satisfying constraint 9.

To satisfy constraint 3, we need p1 to be in l1_3 at some point:

24. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1 (Move truck t1 to l1_3)
25. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (Unload p1 at l1_3)

Now, p1 is in l1_3, satisfying constraint 3.

For constraint 2, we need "p2 is in l1_4" or "p1 is in l2_5" before "p2 is in l2_1" (which is the goal). We've already satisfied this with p1 being in l2_5 (step 4). For additional coverage:

26. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (Load p2 into t1 at l1_1)
27. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1 (Move truck t1 to l1_4)

Now p2 is in l1_4, providing another way for constraint 2 to be satisfied.

28. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 (Move truck t1 back to l1_1)
29. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (Unload p2 at l1_1)
30. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (Load p2 into airplane a1)

This satisfies one part of constraint 8 (p2 is in a1).

31. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (Fly a1 to airport l2_1)
32. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (Unload p2 at airport l2_1)

Now p2 is in l2_1, satisfying constraint 1 and part of the goal.

Finally, to achieve the goal state for p1:

33. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1 (Move truck t1 to l1_3)
34. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (Load p1 into t1 at l1_3)
35. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1 (Move truck t1 back to l1_1)
36. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (Unload p1 at l1_1)
37. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (Load p1 into airplane a1)
38. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (Fly a1 to airport l2_1)
39. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 (Unload p1 at airport l2_1)
40. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (Load p1 into t2 at l2_1)
41. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2 (Move truck t2 to l2_4)
42. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (Unload p1 at l2_4)

Now, p1 is in l2_4 and p2 is in l2_1, achieving the goal!

But wait, I realized I missed constraint 8 partially: "There must be a state where either "p1 is in a2" or "p2 is in a1" is true."

We satisfied one part of it (p2 is in a1 at step 30), but we also need to ensure that p1 is in a2 at some point. Looking at my plan, I did have p1 in a2 (steps 12-13), so constraint 8 is fully satisfied.

Ok, I think the optimized plan achieves all goals and satisfies all constraints. Let me summarize:

Final Plan:
1. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2 (Move truck t2 from airport l2_1 to l2_3)
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (Load p1 into t2 at l2_3)
3. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2 (Move truck t2 to l2_5)
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (Unload p1 at l2_5)
5. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 (Load p2 into t2 at l2_5)
6. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2 (Move truck t2 to l2_2)
7. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (Unload p2 at l2_2)
8. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2 (Move truck t2 back to l2_5)
9. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (Load p1 into t2 at l2_5)
10. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 (Move truck t2 to airport l2_1)
11. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (Unload p1 at airport l2_1)
12. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (Load p1 into airplane a2)
13. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (Fly a2 to airport l1_1)
14. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (Unload p1 at airport l1_1)
15. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 (Move truck t1 to airport l1_1)
16. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (Load p1 into t1)
17. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2 (Move truck t2 back to l2_2)
18. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (Load p2 into t2 at l2_2)
19. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 (Move truck t2 to airport l2_1)
20. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (Unload p2 at airport l2_1)
21. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (Load p2 into airplane a2)
22. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (Fly a2 to airport l1_1)
23. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (Unload p2 at airport l1_1)
24. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1 (Move truck t1 to l1_3)
25. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (Unload p1 at l1_3)
26. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (Load p2 into t1 at l1_1)
27. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1 (Move truck t1 to l1_4)
28. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 (Move truck t1 back to l1_1)
29. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (Unload p2 at l1_1)
30. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (Load p2 into airplane a1)
31. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (Fly a1 to airport l2_1)
32. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (Unload p2 at airport l2_1)
33. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1 (Move truck t1 to l1_3)
34. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (Load p1 into t1 at l1_3)
35. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1 (Move truck t1 back to l1_1)
36. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (Unload p1 at l1_1)
37. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (Load p1 into airplane a1)
38. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (Fly a1 to airport l2_1)
39. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 (Unload p1 at airport l2_1)
40. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (Load p1 into t2 at l2_1)
41. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2 (Move truck t2 to l2_4)
42. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (Unload p1 at l2_4)

The goal is achieved: p1 is in l2_4 and p2 is in l2_1.

Let's also double-check all the constraints I've addressed:

1. "Package p2 is in location l2_1" must be true at some point: Yes, achieved in step 32 and maintained to the end.
2. Before p2 reaches l2_1, there must be a state where either "p2 is in l1_4" or "p1 is in l2_5" is true: p1 is in l2_5 at step 4, and p2 is in l1_4 at step 27, both before p2 reaches l2_1 in step 32, so this constraint is met.
3. "Package p1 is in location l1_3" must be true at some point: Yes, achieved in step 25.
4. "Package p2 is in location l2_2" must be true at some point: Yes, achieved in step 7.
5. "Package p2 is in location l2_5" must be true at some point: Yes, initially p2 is in l2_5.
6. If p2 is in l2_5, then p1 must also be in l2_5 either at the same time or later: p1 is moved to l2_5 in step 4, after p2 starts in l2_5, so this constraint is met.
7. There must be a state where "p2 is in l2_2" and "p1 is in t1" are both true: After steps 7 and 16, p2 is in l2_2 and p1 is in t1, so this constraint is met.
8. There must be a state where either "p1 is in a2" or "p2 is in a1" is true: p1 is in a2 in steps 12-13, and p2 is in a1 in steps 30-31, so this constraint is met.
9. There must be a state where "p2 is in l1_1" and "p1 is in t1" are both true: After step 23, p2 is in l1_1 and p1 is in t1, so this constraint is met.

All constraints are met, and the goal is achieved. The plan is valid.
