Okay, let me try to work through this planning problem step by step. The goal is to get package p1 to l2_4 and p2 to l2_1, while satisfying all the constraints provided. First, I need to understand the initial state and all the constraints.

Starting with the initial state:
- Locations: Cities c1 and c2 each have several locations, including airports l1_1 (c1) and l2_1 (c2).
- Packages:
  - p1 is in l2_3 (city c2).
  - p2 is in l2_5 (city c2).
- Trucks:
  - t1 is in l1_4 (c1).
  - t2 is in l2_1 (c2, which is an airport).
- Airplanes:
  - a1 is in l1_1 (c1's airport).
  - a2 is in l2_1 (c2's airport).

The goal is p1 in l2_4 and p2 in l2_1. Let's note that l2_1 is an airport in c2, and l2_4 is a regular location in c2. So for p2, which is already in l2_5 (c2), maybe we can use a truck to move it. But wait, p2 is initially in l2_5, and the goal is l2_1. So maybe we need to move p2 from l2_5 to l2_1. Since l2_1 is an airport, maybe using a truck to drive there. But t2 is in l2_1 initially. Wait, but how does t2 move? Because to move a truck, you need to drive it between locations in the same city. So t2 is in l2_1 (airport). To get p2 from l2_5 to l2_1, perhaps we need a truck to go from l2_1 to l2_5, load p2, then drive back. But t2 is already at l2_1. Wait, but how is p2 in l2_5? Let me check the initial state again. Oh, the original state says "Package t2 is in location l2_1" but that's probably a typo because t2 is a truck. Wait, looking back: The original state says:

"Package t1 is in location l1_4"
"Package t2 is in location l2_1"
"Package p1 is in location l2_3"
"Package p2 is in location l2_5"
"Package a1 is in location l1_1"
"Package a2 is in location l2_1"

Wait, that can't be right. Because t1 and t2 are trucks, not packages. This must be a mistake in the problem statement. Wait, the problem says "The original state of the world is the following:" and lists:

"Package t1 is in location l1_4"
"Package t2 is in location l2_1"

But t1 and t2 are trucks. So that's a typo. They probably meant "Truck t1 is in location l1_4" and "Truck t2 is in location l2_1". Similarly, "Package a1 is in location l1_1" â€” but a1 is an airplane, not a package. So that's also a typo. The correct initial state should have:

Truck t1 in l1_4
Truck t2 in l2_1
Airplane a1 in l1_1
Airplane a2 in l2_1
Package p1 in l2_3
Package p2 in l2_5

Assuming that's the case, let's proceed.

So, the initial state:

In city c1:
- Locations l1_1 (airport), l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5.
- Truck t1 is at l1_4.
- Airplane a1 is at l1_1 (airport).

In city c2:
- Locations l2_1 (airport), l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5.
- Truck t2 is at l2_1 (airport).
- Airplane a2 is at l2_1 (airport).
- Package p1 is at l2_3.
- Package p2 is at l2_5.

Goal:
- p1 must be in l2_4 (c2).
- p2 must be in l2_1 (c2's airport).

Constraints:

1. At least once, p2 is in l2_1. (This is part of the goal, so it's already required.)
2. If p2 is in l2_1 in some state, there must be an earlier state where p2 was in l1_4 or p1 in l2_5.
3. At least once, p1 is in l1_3.
4. At least once, p2 is in l2_2.
5. At least once, p2 is in l2_5. (It starts there, so that's covered.)
6. If p2 is in l2_5 in a state s, then p1 must be in l2_5 at s or after.
7. At least once, p2 is in l2_2 AND p1 is in t1.
8. At least once, p1 is in a2 OR p2 is in a1.
9. At least once, p2 is in l1_1 AND p1 is in t1.

So, the constraints add several conditions that must be met during the plan.

First, let's outline the steps to achieve the goal:

For p2 to reach l2_1 (goal), since it's in l2_5 (c2), we can use truck t2. But t2 is at l2_1. So t2 needs to drive to l2_5, load p2, then drive back to l2_1. That would require:

- Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_5 (possible since they're in c2).
- Load p2 into t2 at l2_5.
- Drive t2 back to l2_1.
- Unload p2 at l2_1.

But wait, t2 is already at l2_1. So first, drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_5 (possible). Then load p2, drive back to l2_1, unload. That would get p2 to l2_1. So that's straightforward. However, we need to check constraints.

Now for p1, which is at l2_3 (c2), needs to go to l2_4. Since l2_3 and l2_4 are in the same city (c2), we can use truck t2 again. But t2 is moving to handle p2. Alternatively, use another truck. Wait, the trucks available are t1 (in c1) and t2 (in c2). So in c2, only t2 is present. So for p1, which is in l2_3, we need to use t2 to move it. But t2 is busy moving p2. So maybe the steps would be:

- Move t2 from l2_1 to l2_3, load p1, drive to l2_4, unload. But that's conflicting with the p2 movement.

Alternatively, perhaps we need to use airplanes. Let's see. But p1 is in c2, and needs to stay in c2. So perhaps using a truck is sufficient.

But let's think about the constraints:

Constraint 3: At least once, p1 is in l1_3 (which is in c1). So p1 needs to be moved to c1's l1_3 at some point. But p1 starts in c2. So how can we do that? We need to transport p1 from c2 to c1. To do that, we can use an airplane. For example:

- Use truck t2 in c2 to pick up p1 from l2_3, drive to l2_1 (airport), load into airplane a2 (which is at l2_1). Then fly a2 to c1's airport l1_1. Then unload p1 into a1 (but a1 is in l1_1). Wait, no, we can unload into a truck in c1. But t1 is in l1_4. So maybe:

After flying a2 to l1_1 (c1), unload p1 into a1, then load into t1, drive t1 to l1_3, unload. That would satisfy constraint 3. Then, to get p1 back to c2, we need to fly it back. But this seems complicated. Let's check if this is necessary.

Wait, the goal is for p1 to be in l2_4 (c2). So moving p1 to c1 and back would add steps. But constraint 3 requires that at some state, p1 is in l1_3. So we have to include that in the plan.

Similarly, constraint 9 requires that at some point, p2 is in l1_1 (c1's airport) and p1 is in t1. So p2 must be moved to c1's airport, which requires using an airplane. But p2 starts in c2's l2_5. So to get p2 to l1_1, we need to transport it via airplane. Let's outline the steps needed for all constraints.

Constraints to satisfy:

3. p1 in l1_3 (c1) at least once.
4. p2 in l2_2 (c2) at least once.
7. p2 in l2_2 and p1 in t1 at the same time.
8. p1 in a2 or p2 in a1 at least once.
9. p2 in l1_1 and p1 in t1 at the same time.

Also, constraint 6: If p2 is in l2_5 in a state, then p1 must be in l2_5 at that state or after. Since p2 starts in l2_5, we have to make sure that either in the initial state (which is s0), p1 is in l2_5 (it's not; p1 is in l2_3), or in some state after s0, p1 is in l2_5. But the initial state has p2 in l2_5, so constraint 6 requires that after the initial state, p1 must be in l2_5 at some point. So we need to move p1 to l2_5 at some point.

So, steps required:

1. Move p1 from l2_3 to l2_5 (to satisfy constraint 6). Then p1 can be moved elsewhere.

2. Move p2 from l2_5 to l2_2 (to satisfy constraint 4), then perhaps to l2_1.

3. Move p1 to l1_3 (c1), which requires transporting it from c2 to c1 via airplane.

4. Move p2 to l1_1 (c1's airport) to satisfy constraint 9.

5. Ensure that at some point, p1 is in a2 or p2 is in a1 (constraint 8).

6. Ensure that when p2 is in l2_2, p1 is in t1 (constraint 7). Since t1 is in c1, but p1 is in c2, this seems tricky. So perhaps we need to move t1 to c2? Wait, trucks can only drive within their city. So t1 is in c1, can't go to c2. So how can p1 be in t1 (which is in c1) while p2 is in l2_2 (c2)? Unless we have p1 transported to c1, loaded into t1, and then p2 is in l2_2. That would satisfy constraint 7.

Let's start building the plan step by step, considering all constraints.

First, handle constraint 6: Since p2 starts in l2_5, we need p1 to be in l2_5 at some point. So we can move p1 from l2_3 to l2_5 using truck t2.

Steps:
- Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_3 (c2).
- Load p1 into t2 at l2_3.
- Drive t2 to l2_5.
- Unload p1 at l2_5. Now p1 is in l2_5, satisfying constraint 6 when p2 is in l2_5 (initially, but after this step, p2 may have been moved. Wait, but constraint 6 says if p2 is in l2_5 in any state s, then p1 must be in l2_5 in s or after. So if p2 is moved from l2_5 before p1 is placed there, then the initial state s0 has p2 in l2_5 and p1 not. So we need to have p1 in l2_5 after s0. Therefore, moving p1 to l2_5 is necessary.

Next, for constraint 4: p2 must be in l2_2. So we need to move p2 from l2_5 to l2_2. Using truck t2 again.

Steps:
- Drive t2 from l2_5 (after unloading p1) to l2_2.
- Load p2 into t2 at l2_5 (wait, no. To move p2 from l2_5 to l2_2, we need to load p2 into t2 when t2 is at l2_5. So after moving t2 to l2_5, load p2, then drive to l2_2 and unload.

But let's outline this:

After moving p1 to l2_5:

Current state:
- t2 is at l2_5 (after driving there to unload p1).
- p1 is at l2_5.
- p2 is at l2_5 (initial), but maybe already moved? Wait, initial state: p2 is at l2_5.

Wait, initial state: p2 is at l2_5. So to move p2, we need to load it into a truck or airplane.

So steps so far:

1. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_3: to pick up p1.

Action: drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2

2. Load p1 into t2 at l2_3.

Action: loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

3. Drive t2 to l2_5.

Action: drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2

4. Unload p1 at l2_5.

Action: unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

Now p1 is in l2_5, satisfying constraint 6 when p2 is still in l2_5 (but p2 is still there unless we move it). But after this step, p2 is still in l2_5. So in the state after this, p2 is in l2_5 and p1 is in l2_5. So constraint 6 is satisfied because in the state after step 4, p2 is in l2_5 and p1 is also there. So that's okay.

Next, move p2 to l2_2 (constraint 4):

5. Load p2 into t2 at l2_5.

Action: loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5

6. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2.

Action: drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2

7. Unload p2 at l2_2.

Action: unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

Now p2 is in l2_2, satisfying constraint 4.

But we also need constraint 7: At some state, p2 is in l2_2 and p1 is in t1. But t1 is in c1's l1_4. So how can p1 be in t1? p1 is currently in l2_5 (c2). So we need to move p1 from c2 to c1, load into t1.

To do that, we need to use an airplane. Let's consider:

First, move p1 from l2_5 to l2_1 (airport in c2) using t2:

8. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_5 (assuming t2 is at l2_2 after step 7). Wait, after step 7, t2 is at l2_2. So to pick up p1 at l2_5, we need to drive back.

Wait, p1 is in l2_5. So steps 8-11:

8. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_5.

Action: drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2

9. Load p1 into t2 at l2_5.

Action: loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

10. Drive t2 to l2_1 (airport).

Action: drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2

11. Unload p1 at l2_1.

Now p1 is at l2_1 (airport). Then, load p1 into airplane a2 (which is at l2_1):

12. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

13. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1 (c1's airport).

Action: flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

14. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1.

Action: unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

Now p1 is at l1_1 (c1's airport). Then, we need to move it to l1_3 using truck t1:

15. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1.

Action: drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1

16. Load p1 into t1 at l1_1.

Action: loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

17. Drive t1 to l1_3.

Action: drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1

18. Unload p1 at l1_3.

Now, constraint 3 is satisfied (p1 is in l1_3).

But we also need constraint 9: p2 in l1_1 and p1 in t1. So at some point, p2 must be in l1_1 and p1 must be in t1. Let's see when that can happen.

Currently, p1 is in l1_3 (unloaded from t1). So perhaps before step 18, when p1 is in t1 (steps 16-17), we need to have p2 in l1_1.

To get p2 to l1_1, we need to transport it from c2 to c1. Let's plan that.

After step 7, p2 is in l2_2 (c2). Let's say after that, we load p2 into t2 again:

But wait, after step 7, p2 is in l2_2, and t2 is at l2_2. So we could load p2 into t2, drive to l2_1 (airport), load into airplane a2, fly to l1_1, then unload.

But let's interleave these steps.

Let me re-examine the steps. Maybe after moving p1 to l1_3 (step 18), we need to get p2 to l1_1. Let's see.

But let's track the current state after each step to ensure preconditions.

Alternatively, let's try to structure the plan to meet all constraints.

Let me outline the necessary steps in order, considering all constraints:

Constraints to handle:

3. p1 in l1_3.

4. p2 in l2_2.

7. p2 in l2_2 and p1 in t1 (t1 is in c1; so p1 must be in t1 while p2 is in l2_2).

8. p1 in a2 or p2 in a1.

9. p2 in l1_1 and p1 in t1.

Also, constraint 2: If p2 is in l2_1 (goal), then earlier state with p2 in l1_4 or p1 in l2_5. Since p2 starts in l2_5, but we need to ensure that when p2 reaches l2_1, there was an earlier state where p1 was in l2_5 (which we did in step 4).

Now, let's try to structure the plan:

1. Move p1 from l2_3 to l2_5 via t2.

2. Move p2 from l2_5 to l2_2 via t2.

3. Move p1 from l2_5 to l2_1 (airport) via t2.

4. Load p1 into a2 and fly to c1's airport l1_1.

5. Unload p1 into l1_1, then load into t1 and drive to l1_3 (satisfies constraint 3).

6. Now, to satisfy constraint 9 (p2 in l1_1 and p1 in t1), we need to transport p2 to l1_1. So after step 5, p1 is in t1 (during steps 16-17). So perhaps during that time, p2 is also moved to l1_1.

To do that, after moving p2 to l2_2 (step 2), we can:

a. Load p2 into t2 at l2_2, drive to l2_1 (airport), load into a2, fly to l1_1, unload.

But p2 is in l2_2 after step 2. So steps:

After step 2 (p2 in l2_2):

7. Load p2 into t2 at l2_2.

8. Drive t2 to l2_1.

9. Unload p2 at l2_1.

10. Load p2 into a2 at l2_1.

11. Fly a2 to l1_1.

12. Unload p2 at l1_1.

Now, during this time, when is p1 in t1? After step 5 (loading p1 into t1 and driving to l1_3). So during steps 16-17, p1 is in t1. If p2 is in l1_1 during that time, then constraint 9 is satisfied.

But when does p2 arrive at l1_1? Suppose after steps 1-12, p2 is in l1_1. Then, during the steps where p1 is in t1 (steps 16-17), p2 is already in l1_1, so we have p2 in l1_1 and p1 in t1 (during step 16, when t1 is at l1_1 with p1 loaded). Wait, step 16 is load p1 into t1 at l1_1. Then drive to l1_3. So during step 16 (after loading), p1 is in t1, which is at l1_1. If p2 is also at l1_1 at that time, then constraint 9 is satisfied.

So steps would need to have p2 arriving at l1_1 before or during the time p1 is loaded into t1.

Alternatively, after flying p2 to l1_1 (step 12), unload p2 there. Then, when p1 is loaded into t1 (step 16), p2 is in l1_1. So constraint 9 is satisfied.

Now, constraint 8: p1 in a2 or p2 in a1. p1 was loaded into a2 in step 12 (assuming step 12 is loading into a2). Wait, step 12 was unloading p2 from a2 into l1_1. So p1 was in a2 during the flight from l2_1 to l1_1. So during that time, p1 is in a2, satisfying constraint 8.

Also, constraint 7: p2 in l2_2 and p1 in t1. When p2 is in l2_2 (after step 2), p1 is in l2_5 (after step 1). So we need to have p1 in t1 while p2 is in l2_2. How?

Perhaps during the time p2 is in l2_2 (after step 2), p1 is moved to t1. But t1 is in c1. So p1 would need to be in c1's t1. That requires transporting p1 to c1 and into t1. So during step 16, when p1 is loaded into t1 in c1, and p2 is in l2_2 (step 2), but these are in different cities. So they can't be in the same state. Hmm, this is a problem. So constraint 7 requires that in the same state, p2 is in l2_2 and p1 is in t1. But t1 is in c1, and l2_2 is in c2. So how can this happen? Unless the plan includes steps where p1 is in t1 (c1) while p2 is in l2_2 (c2), which is possible as long as both conditions are true in the same state.

Wait, the constraint is that there exists at least one state where both are true. So perhaps after step 2 (p2 in l2_2), we proceed to move p1 to t1 in c1. But during the time p1 is being moved to c1, p2 is still in l2_2. For example, after step 2, we start moving p1 to c1, and during the steps where p1 is in t1 (steps 16-17), p2 is still in l2_2. But after step 2, p2 is in l2_2, and we haven't moved it yet. So if we do steps to move p1 to c1 and into t1, then during that time, p2 remains in l2_2. So in the state after loading p1 into t1 (step 16), p1 is in t1 (c1), and p2 is still in l2_2 (c2). So that state satisfies constraint 7.

Yes, because the constraint requires that in at least one state, both are true. So that state would be after step 16 (p1 in t1) and before moving p2 from l2_2.

So steps:

After step 2 (p2 in l2_2), proceed to move p1 to c1 and into t1. While p1 is in t1 (step 16), p2 is still in l2_2. So that state satisfies constraint 7.

Now, putting it all together:

Plan steps:

1. Move t2 from l2_1 to l2_3 (to pick up p1).
2. Load p1 into t2.
3. Drive t2 to l2_5.
4. Unload p1 at l2_5 (now p1 is here; satisfies constraint 6).
5. Load p2 into t2 at l2_5.
6. Drive t2 to l2_2.
7. Unload p2 at l2_2 (satisfies constraint 4).
8. Drive t2 back to l2_5 to pick up p1.
9. Load p1 into t2.
10. Drive t2 to l2_1.
11. Unload p1 at l2_1.
12. Load p1 into airplane a2.
13. Fly a2 to l1_1.
14. Unload p1 from a2 into l1_1.
15. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1.
16. Load p1 into t1 (now p1 is in t1, and p2 is still in l2_2; satisfies constraint 7).
17. Drive t1 to l1_3.
18. Unload p1 at l1_3 (satisfies constraint 3).
19. Now, need to move p2 from l2_2 to l1_1 for constraint 9. So:
    a. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2 (but t2 is at l2_1 after step 10).
    Wait, after step 10, t2 is at l2_1. To move p2 from l2_2, we need to drive t2 to l2_2:
    
19. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2.
20. Load p2 into t2.
21. Drive t2 back to l2_1.
22. Unload p2 at l2_1.
23. Load p2 into a2.
24. Fly a2 to l1_1.
25. Unload p2 at l1_1 (now p2 is here, and p1 is in l1_3, but we need a state where p2 is in l1_1 and p1 is in t1. At step 16, p1 was in t1, but p2 wasn't in l1_1 yet. So after step 25, we need to have p1 in t1 again. But p1 is in l1_3 (unloaded). So perhaps after unloading p1 at l1_3 (step 18), we reload it into t1:

26. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1 (if t1 is at l1_3 after step 18).
27. Load p1 into t1 again.
Now, at this point, p2 is in l1_1 (step 25), and p1 is in t1 (step 27), so constraint 9 is satisfied.

Then, to get p1 back to c2 to reach the goal of l2_4:

28. Drive t1 to l1_1's airport (already there).
29. Unload p1 into a1 (but a1 is at l1_1).
30. Load p1 into a1.
31. Fly a1 to l2_1.
32. Unload p1 into l2_1.
33. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4 (since p1 needs to be there).
34. Load p1 into t2.
35. Drive to l2_4.
36. Unload p1.

But this is getting very long. Also, the goal requires p2 to be in l2_1. After step 22, p2 is in l2_1 (unloaded from t2). But step 23-25 move p2 to l1_1. So that would conflict with the goal. Therefore, we need to adjust.

Wait, the goal is p2 in l2_1. So after all steps, p2 must end up in l2_1. But steps 23-25 move p2 to l1_1. So we need to bring p2 back to l2_1.

Alternatively, perhaps we need to not move p2 to l1_1 at all, but find another way to satisfy constraint 9. But constraint 9 requires p2 in l1_1 and p1 in t1. So we have to do that.

This is getting very complicated. Let's think of a more optimal way.

Alternative approach:

Use airplanes to transport p1 and p2 between cities to meet the constraints, while ensuring the final goal.

Let me try to outline a possible plan:

1. Move p1 to l2_5 using t2 (satisfy constraint 6).

2. Move p2 to l2_2 using t2 (satisfy constraint 4).

3. Move p1 to l2_1 via t2, load into a2, fly to l1_1 (satisfy constraint 8: p1 in a2).

4. Unload p1 into l1_1, load into t1, drive to l1_3 (satisfy constraint 3).

5. Now, p1 is in l1_3. To satisfy constraint 7 (p2 in l2_2 and p1 in t1), we need to have p1 in t1 while p2 is in l2_2. So after step 4, p1 is in l1_3 (unloaded), so we need to load it back into t1:

6. Drive t1 to l1_3, load p1, drive back to l1_1.

But this seems redundant. Alternatively, during step 4, when p1 is loaded into t1 (before driving to l1_3), p2 is still in l2_2, so constraint 7 is satisfied at that moment.

So during step 4:

After loading p1 into t1 (action: loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1), then driving to l1_3. At the moment after loading, p1 is in t1, and p2 is in l2_2. So that state satisfies constraint 7.

Yes, because during that state, p2 is in l2_2 (from step 2), and p1 is in t1 (loaded in l1_1). So that works.

Now, constraint 9 requires p2 in l1_1 and p1 in t1. So during step when p1 is in t1 (after loading into t1 in l1_1), we need p2 to be in l1_1. So we need to move p2 to l1_1 at that time.

To do that:

After step 2 (p2 in l2_2), we can:

a. Load p2 into t2, drive to l2_1 (airport).

b. Load p2 into a2, fly to l1_1.

c. Unload p2 into l1_1.

At the same time, p1 is being moved to l1_1 and loaded into t1.

So steps:

After step 2 (p2 in l2_2):

3. Load p2 into t2 at l2_2.

4. Drive t2 to l2_1.

5. Unload p2 at l2_1.

6. Load p2 into a2.

7. Fly a2 to l1_1.

8. Unload p2 into l1_1.

Now, during this time, p1 is being moved:

1. Move p1 from l2_3 to l2_5.

2. Move p2 to l2_2.

3. Move p1 to l2_1.

4. Load p1 into a2 and fly to l1_1.

5. Unload p1 into l1_1.

6. Load p1 into t1.

At this point, p1 is in t1 (l1_1), and p2 is in l1_1 (from step 8). So constraint 9 is satisfied (p2 in l1_1 and p1 in t1).

Then, to move p1 to l1_3 (constraint 3):

7. Drive t1 to l1_3 and unload.

Now, p1 is in l1_3.

But we also need to move p1 back to c2 to reach the goal (l2_4). So:

8. Drive t1 back to l1_1.

9. Unload p1 into l1_1.

10. Load p1 into a1 (which is at l1_1).

11. Fly a1 to l2_1.

12. Unload p1 into l2_1.

13. Load p1 into t2.

14. Drive t2 to l2_4.

15. Unload p1.

For p2, after being unloaded in l1_1 (step 8), we need to move it back to l2_1 to meet the goal:

16. Load p2 into a1 (at l1_1).

17. Fly a1 to l2_1.

18. Unload p2 into l2_1.

Now, all goals are met.

But this plan is quite long. Let's check if it meets all constraints:

Constraint 3: p1 in l1_3 (step 7).

Constraint 4: p2 in l2_2 (step 2).

Constraint 7: p2 in l2_2 and p1 in t1. At step 2, p2 is in l2_2. Then, after step 6 (p1 loaded into t1), p1 is in t1. So during the state after step 6, p2 is still in l2_2 (assuming we didn't move it yet). But no, after step 2, p2 is moved in step 3. So perhaps the timing is off.

Wait, the steps for moving p2:

After step 2 (p2 in l2_2), step 3 is loading p2 into t2. So after step 3, p2 is in t2. Then step 4 is driving to l2_1. So in step 4, p2 is in t2 at l2_1. Then step 5 unloads p2 into l2_1. So after step 5, p2 is in l2_1. Then steps 6-8 move p2 to l1_1.

So the state where p2 is in l2_2 is only after step 2, before step 3. So for constraint 7 (p2 in l2_2 and p1 in t1), we need to have p1 in t1 during that time. But when is p1 loaded into t1?

In this plan, p1 is loaded into t1 after being flown to l1_1 (step 6). But at that time, p2 has already been moved from l2_2. So constraint 7 would not be satisfied.

Hmm, this is a problem. So perhaps the plan needs to have p1 in t1 while p2 is still in l2_2.

Alternative approach:

After moving p2 to l2_2 (step 2), leave it there temporarily and focus on getting p1 into t1 while p2 is still in l2_2.

So:

1. Move p1 to l2_5 via t2.

2. Move p2 to l2_2 via t2.

3. Move p1 to l2_1, load into a2, fly to l1_1.

4. Unload p1 into l1_1.

5. Load p1 into t1.

At this moment, p1 is in t1 (step 5), and p2 is in l2_2 (step 2), satisfying constraint 7.

6. Drive t1 to l1_3, unload p1 (constraint 3).

Then, proceed to move p2 to l1_1 for constraint 9:

7. Load p2 into t2 at l2_2.

8. Drive t2 to l2_1.

9. Load p2 into a2, fly to l1_1.

10. Unload p2 into l1_1.

Now, during step 5 (p1 in t1), p2 is in l2_2. During step 10, p2 is in l1_1. To satisfy constraint 9, we need a state where p2 is in l1_1 and p1 is in t1. So after step 10, p2 is in l1_1. If we reload p1 into t1 after step 6:

11. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1.

12. Load p1 into t1.

Now, p2 is in l1_1 and p1 is in t1 (step 12), satisfying constraint 9.

Then, move both packages back to c2:

For p1:

13. Drive t1 to l1_1, unload p1.

14. Load p1 into a1, fly to l2_1.

15. Unload into l2_1.

16. Load into t2, drive to l2_4, unload.

For p2:

17. Load p2 into a1, fly to l2_1, unload.

This meets the goal.

This plan seems to cover all constraints. Let's verify:

- Constraint 2: When p2 is in l2_1 (goal), there must be an earlier state where p2 was in l1_4 or p1 in l2_5. We have p1 in l2_5 (step 1), so this is satisfied.

- Constraint 3: p1 in l1_3 (step 6).

- Constraint 4: p2 in l2_2 (step 2).

- Constraint 7: p2 in l2_2 and p1 in t1 (step 5, p1 in t1; p2 in l2_2 before step 7).

- Constraint 8: p1 in a2 (step 3).

- Constraint 9: p2 in l1_1 and p1 in t1 (step 12).

Now, let's write the step-by-step actions:

1. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_3.

Action: drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2

2. Load p1 into t2 at l2_3.

Action: loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

3. Drive t2 to l2_5.

Action: drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2

4. Unload p1 at l2_5.

Action: unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

5. Load p2 into t2 at l2_5.

Action: loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5

6. Drive t2 to l2_2.

Action: drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2

7. Unload p2 at l2_2.

Action: unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

Now, p2 is in l2_2 (constraint 4 met).

8. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_5 to pick up p1 again.

Wait, after step 7, t2 is at l2_2. To pick up p1 at l2_5, drive back:

8. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_5.

Action: drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2

9. Load p1 into t2 at l2_5.

Action: loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

10. Drive t2 to l2_1.

Action: drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2

11. Unload p1 at l2_1.

Action: unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

12. Load p1 into airplane a2 at l2_1.

Action: loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

13. Fly a2 to l1_1.

Action: flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

14. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1.

Action: unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

15. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1.

Action: drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1

16. Load p1 into t1 at l1_1.

Action: loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

Now, p1 is in t1 (step 16), and p2 is in l2_2 (from step 7). So constraint 7 is satisfied (p2 in l2_2 and p1 in t1).

17. Drive t1 to l1_3.

Action: drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1

18. Unload p1 at l1_3.

Action: unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3

Now, constraint 3 is met.

Next, move p2 to l1_1 for constraint 9:

19. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2 (t2 is at l2_1 after step 11).

Action: drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2

20. Load p2 into t2 at l2_2.

Action: loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

21. Drive t2 to l2_1.

Action: drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2

22. Unload p2 at l2_1.

Action: unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

23. Load p2 into a2 at l2_1.

Action: loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

24. Fly a2 to l1_1.

Action: flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

25. Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1.

Action: unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

Now, p2 is in l1_1. To satisfy constraint 9, we need p1 in t1 at the same time. So reload p1 into t1:

26. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1.

Action: drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1

27. Load p1 into t1 at l1_1.

Action: loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

Now, constraint 9 is satisfied (p2 in l1_1 and p1 in t1).

Next, move p1 back to c2:

28. Drive t1 to l1_1 (already there), unload p1.

Action: unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

29. Load p1 into a1 at l1_1.

Action: loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

30. Fly a1 to l2_1.

Action: flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

31. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1.

Action: unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

32. Load p1 into t2 at l2_1.

Action: loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

33. Drive t2 to l2_4.

Action: drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2

34. Unload p1 at l2_4.

Action: unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

For p2 to return to l2_1:

35. Load p2 into a1 at l1_1.

Action: loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

36. Fly a1 to l2_1.

Action: flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

37. Unload p2 from a1 at l2_1.

Action: unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

Now, p2 is in l2_1 (goal met), and p1 is in l2_4 (goal met).

But this plan is very long. Let's see if we can optimize it.

Alternative approach: Find a shorter path by combining steps.

For example, after step 25 (p2 in l1_1), we can fly p2 back to l2_1 using a1:

But perhaps we can use the same airplane a2 to move p2 back.

Alternatively, after step 25, p2 is in l1_1. Then:

26. Load p2 into a1 at l1_1.

Action: loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

27. Fly a1 to l2_1.

Action: flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

28. Unload p2 at l2_1.

This meets the goal for p2.

For p1, after step 18 (p1 in l1_3), we need to get it to l2_4. So:

19. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1.

20. Load p1 into a1.

21. Fly a1 to l2_1.

22. Unload p1 into l2_1.

23. Load p1 into t2.

24. Drive to l2_4 and unload.

This would be shorter.

Integrating this:

Steps after step 18 (p1 in l1_3):

19. Drive t1 to l1_1.

20. Load p1 into a1.

21. Fly a1 to l2_1.

22. Unload p1 into l2_1.

23. Load p1 into t2.

24. Drive to l2_4.

25. Unload p1.

Meanwhile, for p2:

After step 25 (p2 in l1_1):

26. Load p2 into a1.

27. Fly to l2_1.

28. Unload p2.

This would meet the goals.

But we also need to handle constraint 9 (p2 in l1_1 and p1 in t1). This occurs when p2 is in l1_1 (step 25) and p1 is in t1. But after step 18, p1 is in l1_3 (unloaded from t1). So we need to have p1 in t1 while p2 is in l1_1.

So after step 25, p2 is in l1_1. To get p1 into t1 again:

26. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1.

27. Load p1 into t1.

Now, p2 is in l1_1 and p1 is in t1 (constraint 9 met).

Then proceed to fly both back.

This adds steps, but ensures all constraints are met.

This is getting quite involved. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed to outline the optimal plan considering all these steps, ensuring the shortest path possible.

After considering all constraints and steps, the optimal plan would be:
