Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. So, the goal is to have both p1 and p2 in l1_3. But wait, the initial state says they're already there? Let me check again. The original state says p1 and p2 are in l1_3. Oh, but the task is to bring them to l1_3, which is where they already are. Hmm, that seems odd. Maybe there's a mistake here. Wait, no—maybe the problem is that the initial state might have a typo. Let me recheck the original state description.

Looking back: "Package p1 is in location l1_3", "Package p2 is in location l1_3". So both packages are already at their goal locations. But why is the task to bring them there? That's strange. Unless there's a mistake in the problem setup. Or perhaps the problem is designed to test handling of such cases where no actions are needed. But then there are constraints that must be satisfied during the plan. So even if the initial state meets the goal, we might need to perform actions to satisfy the constraints.

Wait, the constraints require that certain conditions hold in at least one state of the plan. But if the plan is empty (since the goal is already met), then those constraints must be checked in the initial state. Let's check each constraint against the initial state:

1. At least one of "p2 in a1" or "p2 in l2_5". Initial state: p2 is in l1_3. Neither holds. So this constraint is not satisfied initially. Hence, we need a plan that includes actions that make these conditions true at some point.

2. At least one of "p1 in t2" or "p2 in l2_3". Initial p1 is in l1_3, t2 is a truck. The initial location of t2 is not specified. Wait, the original state says "Package t1 is in location l1_5", "Package t2 is in location l2_5". Wait, wait, that's a typo in the problem. Because t1 and t2 are trucks, not packages. So that must be a mistake. The original state probably meant "Truck t1 is in location l1_5", "Truck t2 is in location l2_5". Similarly, "Package a1 is in location l1_1" but a1 is an airplane. So that's another mistake. The problem has incorrect object types in the initial state. For example, "Package t1 is in l1_5" but t1 is a truck. That's impossible. So there's a mistake here. But perhaps it's a typo, and the correct initial positions are:

Truck t1 is in l1_5, Truck t2 is in l2_5. Airplane a1 is in l1_1, a2 is in l2_1. The packages p1 and p2 are in l1_3. So the initial state has trucks and airplanes in certain locations.

Assuming that's the case, the problem is to get p1 and p2 to l1_3 (which they are already at), but with the constraints that certain conditions must hold in at least one state during the plan. Therefore, even though the goal is already satisfied, we need to perform actions that trigger these constraints, then return the packages to their original positions.

But this is confusing. Let me proceed step by step.

First, confirm the initial state:

Original state (correcting possible typos):

- Locations in c1: l1_1 (airport), l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5.

- Locations in c2: l2_1 (airport), l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5.

Trucks:

- Truck t1 is in l1_5 (city c1).

- Truck t2 is in l2_5 (city c2).

Airplanes:

- Airplane a1 is in l1_1 (airport in c1).

- Airplane a2 is in l2_1 (airport in c2).

Packages:

- p1 and p2 are in l1_3 (city c1).

So the goal is to have p1 and p2 in l1_3. But they are already there. So the plan could be empty, but the constraints require that certain conditions must hold in at least one state of the plan. Since the initial state doesn't meet all constraints, we need to perform some actions to meet them, then possibly revert back.

Constraints:

1. At least once: p2 in a1 or p2 in l2_5.

Initial: p2 is in l1_3. So not satisfied. So during the plan, p2 must be in a1 or l2_5 at some point.

2. At least once: p1 in t2 or p2 in l2_3.

Initially, p1 is in l1_3, t2 is in l2_5 (truck in c2). So not satisfied. So during plan, p1 must be in t2 (which is a truck in c2) or p2 in l2_3.

3. At least once: p2 in l2_4 or p2 in a2.

Need to have p2 in either of these.

4. At least once: p1 in a1 or p1 in l2_5.

5. At least once: p2 in l2_2 or p2 in a2.

6. At least once: p2 in l1_4 or p1 in l1_2.

7. At least once: p2 in t1.

So all these seven constraints must be met at some point in the plan.

Given that the goal requires p1 and p2 to be in l1_3, but we need to move them around to satisfy the constraints and then bring them back.

So the plan must include moving p1 and p2 through various locations and vehicles to satisfy all constraints.

Let's list each constraint and see how to satisfy them.

Constraint 7: p2 in t1. So at some point, p2 must be loaded into t1. t1 is in l1_5 (c1). So to load p2 into t1, we need to get p2 to l1_5, then loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5.

But p2 starts in l1_3. So maybe drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_3 (but wait, t1 is in l1_5. To drive to l1_3, since they're both in c1, possible. So drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1. Then loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3. Then unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 again. That would satisfy constraint 7 when p2 is in t1.

But then we also need to satisfy other constraints.

Constraint 1: p2 in a1 or l2_5. To get p2 into a1 (which is in l1_1), need to first move a1 to l1_1 (it's already there), load p2 into a1. So maybe loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1. But to get p2 to l1_1, need to transport it. Since a1 is an airplane, can fly between airports. So maybe:

- Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_3 (c1), load p2 into t1.

- Drive t1 to l1_1 (airport in c1). Wait, can trucks drive between any locations in the same city? Yes, drivetruck can move between any two locations in the same city.

Wait, l1_1 is in c1. So t1 can drive from l1_5 to l1_1 via other locations. Wait, but the drive action moves from l_from to l_to in one step. So to go from l1_5 to l1_1, need to drive through intermediate locations? Or can it go directly? The action allows drivetruck t l_from l_to c as long as both locations are in c. So if l_from and l_to are in the same city, the truck can drive directly. So t1 can drive from l1_5 to l1_1 directly.

So steps:

drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1 → loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 → drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1 → unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 → loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 → flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 → unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 → ... ?

But this might be getting complicated. Let's try to map out all constraints and see which can be combined.

Let me list each constraint and possible ways to satisfy them:

1. p2 in a1 or l2_5.

   - To get p2 into a1: need to have p2 at l1_1 (since a1 is there initially), load into a1.

   - Or get p2 to l2_5. l2_5 is in c2, which is a different city. So maybe using airplane a2 or a1 to carry p2 to l2_1 (airport of c2), then truck t2 (in l2_5) could move to l2_1? Wait, t2 is in l2_5. So drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2. Then load p2 into t2, drive to l2_5, unload there. But this would require moving p2 to c2.

But the goal is to have p2 back in l1_3, so any movement to c2 would require bringing it back.

Constraint 2: p1 in t2 (truck in c2) or p2 in l2_3.

If we can get p1 into t2, that would satisfy this. But p1 is in c1, t2 is in c2. To get p1 into t2, need to transport p1 to c2. That would involve moving p1 via airplane.

Similarly, getting p2 into l2_3 would require moving to c2.

Constraint 3: p2 in l2_4 or a2.

l2_4 is in c2. a2 is in l2_1 (airport). So to get p2 into a2, load it at l2_1.

Constraint4: p1 in a1 or l2_5.

a1 is in l1_1. To get p1 into a1, need to move p1 to l1_1 and load. l2_5 is in c2, so p1 would need to be transported there.

Constraint5: p2 in l2_2 or a2.

l2_2 is in c2. a2 is in l2_1.

Constraint6: p2 in l1_4 or p1 in l1_2.

l1_4 is in c1. So p2 could be moved there. l1_2 is in c1, so p1 could be moved there.

Constraint7: p2 in t1.

t1 is in c1, l1_5. So load p2 into t1.

So to satisfy all constraints, perhaps the plan involves moving p1 and p2 through various locations and vehicles, then returning them to l1_3.

But this is quite complex. Let's try to find a sequence that satisfies all constraints with minimal steps.

First, constraint7: p2 must be in t1 at some point. So we need to load p2 into t1. Since t1 is in l1_5, and p2 is in l1_3, we need to move t1 to l1_3, load p2, then perhaps unload it again.

But moving t1 from l1_5 to l1_3: drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1. Then loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3. This satisfies constraint7. Then, to unload, unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3. But this brings us back to the original state for p2. However, during the plan, when p2 is in t1, constraint7 is satisfied.

Now, constraint6: p2 in l1_4 or p1 in l1_2. Let's say we move p1 to l1_2. To do that, need a truck in c1. t1 is in l1_5 initially. So drive t1 to l1_3, load p1 into t1, drive to l1_2, unload. Then p1 is in l1_2, satisfying constraint6. Then, to get p1 back to l1_3, drive t1 to l1_3 again.

But this would add steps:

drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1

loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3

drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1

unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 → this satisfies constraint6 (p1 in l1_2)

Then, to return p1 to l1_3:

loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2

drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1

unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3

But this is a lot of steps. Alternatively, maybe using another truck? Wait, t1 is the only truck in c1. The problem states trucks t1 and t2. t1 is in c1, t2 in c2.

So in c1, only t1 is available. So for any movement in c1, we need to use t1.

Now, constraint4: p1 in a1 or l2_5. Let's consider getting p1 into a1. a1 is in l1_1. So drive t1 to l1_3, load p1, drive to l1_1, unload, then load into a1. Then fly a1 to l2_1 (c2's airport). Then unload p1 in l2_1. Then maybe load into t2 (if t2 is driven to l2_1), then drive to l2_5. But this would satisfy constraint4 (p1 in l2_5). But this would take p1 out of c1, requiring bringing it back, which would need another airplane flight.

Alternatively, just load p1 into a1 in l1_1 and leave it there. But then to satisfy constraint4, that's sufficient. Because if p1 is loaded into a1, then at that state, p1 is in a1, satisfying constraint4. Then we can unload it back to l1_1 and transport back to l1_3.

But this requires:

1. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_3 (load p1)

2. Drive to l1_1 (unload p1 there)

3. Load into a1.

So steps:

drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1

loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3

drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1

unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 → this satisfies constraint4 (p1 in a1)

Then, to get p1 back, fly a1 to l1_1 (it's already there), but maybe unload it back. Wait, after loading, p1 is in a1. Then to get it back, unload at l1_1, then load into t1 again, drive to l1_3, unload.

But this would add steps:

unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1

unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3

This way, p1 is back in l1_3, and constraint4 is satisfied when p1 is in a1.

Similarly, for constraint1: p2 in a1 or l2_5. Suppose we load p2 into a1. So during the same trip, perhaps.

But p2 is in l1_3 initially. So need to drive t1 to l1_3, load both p1 and p2? Wait, but trucks can carry multiple packages? The problem doesn't specify any capacity limits, so assuming they can carry multiple.

But the actions are per package. So to load both p1 and p2 into t1, we need two load actions.

So steps:

drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1

loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3

loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1

unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

Then load p1 into a1 (satisfies constraint4) and p2 into a1 (satisfies constraint1).

But then, after flying a1 to another location, say l2_1, unload them there, and then bring back.

But this is getting complicated. Let's try to see if we can satisfy multiple constraints with the same steps.

For example, loading p2 into t1 satisfies constraint7. Then, driving t1 to l1_1, unloading p2 there, then loading into a1 would satisfy constraint1 (p2 in a1). Then, flying a1 to l2_1, unloading p2 there, then using t2 to move p2 to l2_5 (satisfies constraint1 again), then fly back.

But each step has to be considered.

Alternatively, let's outline the steps needed to hit all constraints:

- Constraint7: p2 in t1.

- Constraint1: p2 in a1 or l2_5.

- Constraint2: p1 in t2 or p2 in l2_3.

- Constraint3: p2 in l2_4 or a2.

- Constraint4: p1 in a1 or l2_5.

- Constraint5: p2 in l2_2 or a2.

- Constraint6: p2 in l1_4 or p1 in l1_2.

Let's tackle them one by one.

First, handle constraint7: load p2 into t1.

Steps:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1.

2. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3. (Now p2 is in t1; satisfies constraint7)

3. Now, to unload p2 back to l1_3: unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3. (But this reverts p2's position.)

But perhaps we can use this load as part of moving p2 elsewhere.

Next, constraint6: p2 in l1_4 or p1 in l1_2.

If we move p1 to l1_2, that satisfies it. To do that:

4. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (after step 2, t1 is in l1_3 with p2 loaded. Wait, after step 2, t1 is in l1_3, loaded with p2. Then, can we load p1 into t1 as well? Yes.

So step 3: loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3.

Then drive t1 to l1_2:

4. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1.

5. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2. (Now p1 is in l1_2; satisfies constraint6)

Then, unload p2 as well:

6. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2. (Now p2 is in l1_2, but this doesn't help any constraints except maybe none. Wait, no. But this leaves p1 in l1_2 and p2 in l1_2. Then, to get them back to l1_3:

7. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2.

8. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2.

9. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1.

10. unload both.

This is a lot of steps. But let's see which constraints are met so far:

- constraint7: step2.

- constraint6: step5.

Now, let's consider constraint2: p1 in t2 or p2 in l2_3.

t2 is in c2. To get p1 into t2, need to move p1 to c2. That requires using an airplane. For example, load p1 into a1 in l1_1, fly to l2_1, unload, load into t2, then drive to some location.

Alternatively, have p2 in l2_3. So if p2 is moved to l2_3, that satisfies constraint2. But l2_3 is in c2. So need to transport p2 to c2.

This seems complicated. Maybe it's easier to satisfy some constraints through multiple steps.

Let's think of a plan that involves moving p2 to a2 in l2_1 (satisfying constraint3 and 5), and p1 to a1 (satisfying constraint4), then moving them back.

Here's a possible plan outline:

1. Move t1 to l1_3, load p1 and p2.

2. Drive t1 to l1_1.

3. Unload p1 and p2 in l1_1.

4. Load p1 into a1 (satisfies constraint4).

5. Load p2 into a1 (satisfies constraint1).

6. Fly a1 to l2_1.

7. Unload p1 and p2 in l2_1.

8. Load p2 into a2 (satisfies constraint3 and 5).

9. Fly a2 to l2_3 (but wait, can airplanes only fly between airports? Yes. Airplanes can only move between airports. l2_1 is an airport, but l2_3 is not. So airplane a2 can't fly to l2_3. Airplanes can only move between airports, which are l1_1 and l2_1. So to get p2 to l2_3, we need to use a truck in c2. So after arriving in l2_1 (airport of c2), unload p2, load into t2 (which is in l2_5, need to drive to l2_1).

So steps would be:

After step7:

p1 and p2 are in l2_1.

8. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2.

9. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.

10. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2.

11. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (satisfies constraint2: p2 in l2_3).

Then, to satisfy constraint3 (p2 in l2_4 or a2):

12. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2.

13. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (satisfies constraint3).

Then, to get p2 back to c1:

14. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4.

15. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2.

16. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.

17. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (satisfies constraint3 and 5 when p2 is in a2).

18. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

19. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1.

Then, load p2 into t1 and drive to l1_3.

But this is getting very long. Also, we need to handle p1. After step7, p1 is in l2_1. To satisfy constraint4 (p1 in a1 or l2_5). If we leave p1 in l2_1, that doesn't satisfy it. So need to move p1 to l2_5.

For example:

After step7:

p1 is in l2_1. Load into t2 (if t2 is in l2_1).

But t2 is driven to l2_1 in step8. So after step8, t2 is in l2_1. So step9: load p2 into t2. Then step10: drive to l2_3.

But p1 is still in l2_1. To get p1 to l2_5:

20. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1.

21. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2.

22. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (satisfies constraint4: p1 in l2_5).

Then, to get p1 back, we need to load it into t2 again and drive to l2_1, load into a2, fly back to l1_1, etc.

This is getting too lengthy. Maybe there's a smarter way to satisfy multiple constraints with fewer steps.

Alternatively, find the minimal path that touches all constraints.

But given the complexity, perhaps the optimal plan is to do the following steps:

1. Load p2 into t1 (satisfy constraint7).

2. Drive t1 to l1_1.

3. Load p2 into a1 (satisfy constraint1).

4. Fly a1 to l2_1.

5. Unload p2 into l2_1.

6. Load p2 into a2 (satisfy constraint3 and5).

7. Fly a2 back to l1_1.

8. Unload p2 into l1_1.

9. Drive t1 to l1_1, load p2, drive back to l1_3, unload.

But this would miss some constraints. For example, constraint2 requires p1 in t2 or p2 in l2_3. In this plan, p2 is never in l2_3, so need p1 in t2. But p1 is in c1, so to get p1 into t2 (which is in c2), need to transport p1 to c2.

Alternatively, during the same plan, transport p1 as well.

This is getting too time-consuming. Let's try to outline steps that cover all constraints:

Steps:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1.

2. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 → constraint7 satisfied.

3. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3.

4. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1.

5. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1.

6. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

7. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 → constraint4 (p1 in a1).

8. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 → constraint1 (p2 in a1).

9. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1.

10. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1.

11. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1.

12. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2.

13. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.

14. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2 → constraint2 (p2 in l2_3).

15. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3.

16. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2 → move to l2_4.

17. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 → constraint3 (p2 in l2_4).

18. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4.

19. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2 → move to l2_2.

20. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 → constraint5 (p2 in l2_2).

21. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2.

22. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2.

23. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.

24. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 → constraint3 (p2 in a2) and constraint5 (p2 in a2).

25. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

26. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1.

27. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

28. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1.

29. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3.

Meanwhile, handle p1:

After step10, p1 is in l2_1.

30. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 → but t2 is in l2_1 after step12.

Wait, step12: drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2. So after step12, t2 is in l2_1.

Then, after step10, p1 is in l2_1. So step31 (insert after step12):

31. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1.

32. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2.

33. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 → constraint4 (p1 in l2_5).

34. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5.

35. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2.

36. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1.

37. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1.

38. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

39. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1.

40. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1.

41. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1.

42. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3.

Now, all constraints are satisfied:

- constraint7: step2.

- constraint1: step8.

- constraint2: step14 (p2 in l2_3).

- constraint3: steps17 and24.

- constraint4: step33 (p1 in l2_5) and step7 (p1 in a1).

- constraint5: steps20 and24.

- constraint6: step5 (p1 in l1_1, not l1_2. Oh, wait, constraint6 requires p2 in l1_4 or p1 in l1_2. None of the steps have p1 in l1_2. So this plan misses constraint6.

So we need to add steps to satisfy constraint6.

To satisfy constraint6, either move p2 to l1_4 or p1 to l1_2.

Let's modify the plan to include moving p1 to l1_2.

After step3, p1 is loaded into t1. Then, instead of driving directly to l1_1, drive to l1_2 first:

Modify steps:

4. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1.

5. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 → satisfies constraint6.

6. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2.

7. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2.

8. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2.

9. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1.

10. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1.

11. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

Then proceed with loading into a1 as before.

This adds a few steps but satisfies constraint6.

Now, the plan includes:

Steps:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1.

2. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 → constraint7.

3. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3.

4. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1.

5. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 → constraint6.

6. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2.

7. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2.

8. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2.

9. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1.

10. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1.

11. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

12. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 → constraint4.

13. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 → constraint1.

14. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1.

15. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1.

16. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1.

17. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2.

18. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.

19. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2 → constraint2 (p2 in l2_3).

20. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3.

21. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2.

22. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 → constraint3.

23. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4.

24. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2.

25. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 → constraint5.

26. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2.

27. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2.

28. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.

29. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 → constraints3 and5.

30. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

31. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1.

32. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

33. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1.

34. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3.

Now, handling p1:

After step15, p1 is in l2_1.

35. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1.

36. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2 → p1 in t2.

37. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 → constraint4.

38. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5.

39. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2.

40. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1.

41. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1.

42. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

43. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1.

44. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1.

45. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1.

46. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3.

This plan now covers all constraints. However, it's very long. Is there a shorter way?

Let's see if some steps can be optimized.

For example, after step19, p2 is in l2_3 (satisfies constraint2). Then moving to l2_4 (satisfies constraint3), then to l2_2 (satisfies constraint5). Also, loading into a2 satisfies constraint3 and5 again.

But maybe some steps can be skipped. For example, after step19, p2 is in l2_3 (constraint2 done). Then, driving to l2_4 and unloading satisfies constraint3. Then, driving to l2_2 and unloading satisfies constraint5. So those steps are needed.

Similarly, loading into a2 later covers constraint3 and5 again, but perhaps redundant.

But each of those steps is necessary to hit the required constraints.

Alternatively, after loading p2 into a2 (step29), that covers both constraint3 and5. So steps21-25 may be redundant. Let's see:

If after step18, p2 is loaded into t2 and driven to l2_3 (step19), then unloaded (step20), that satisfies constraint2. Then, driving to l2_1, load into a2, fly to l1_1. So steps:

19. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2 → after loading p2 into t2 in l2_1.

20. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 → constraint2.

21. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3.

22. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2.

23. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.

24. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 → satisfies constraint3 and5.

25. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

This would reduce steps. Then, constraint3 and5 are satisfied by loading into a2. Similarly, constraint2 by step20.

But what about constraint3 requires p2 in l2_4 or a2. So if p2 is in a2 (step24), that satisfies constraint3 and5.

So perhaps the steps can be optimized as:

After step16 (p2 in l2_1):

17. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2.

18. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.

19. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2 → constraint2.

20. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3.

21. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3.

22. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2.

23. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.

24. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 → constraints3 and5.

25. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

This way, steps for l2_4 and l2_2 are avoided, but then constraint3 and5 are covered by step24.

However, constraint3 requires p2 to be in l2_4 or a2. So step24 (p2 in a2) satisfies constraint3. Similarly, constraint5 requires p2 in l2_2 or a2, which is also satisfied by step24.

Thus, we can skip the steps moving to l2_4 and l2_2, reducing the number of steps.

Similarly, for p1:

After step15 (p1 in l2_1), load into t2, drive to l2_5, unload (constraint4), then load back and fly.

So revised plan steps:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1.

2. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 → constraint7.

3. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3.

4. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1.

5. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 → constraint6.

6. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2.

7. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2.

8. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2.

9. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1.

10. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1.

11. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

12. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 → constraint4.

13. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 → constraint1.

14. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1.

15. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1.

16. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1.

17. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2.

18. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.

19. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2 → constraint2.

20. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3.

21. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3.

22. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2.

23. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.

24. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 → constraints3,5.

25. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

26. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1.

27. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

28. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1.

29. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3.

Handling p1:

30. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (t2 is in l2_1 after step17).

31. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2 → constraint4 (p1 in l2_5).

32. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5.

33. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5.

34. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2.

35. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1.

36. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1.

37. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

38. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1.

39. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1.

40. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1.

41. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3.

Now, check all constraints:

- constraint7: step2.

- constraint1: step13.

- constraint2: step19.

- constraint3: step24.

- constraint4: step32.

- constraint5: step24.

- constraint6: step5.

All constraints are satisfied. But this plan is 41 steps long, which is probably not optimal. The problem states that the plan should be optimal, i.e., minimal length.

Therefore, we need to find a way to cover all constraints with fewer steps.

Alternative approach: Use each package's movement to cover multiple constraints.

For example, moving p2 through a2 and l2_5 could satisfy multiple constraints.

But let's think of a different approach.

First, handle constraint7: p2 in t1. This requires loading p2 into t1.

Then, to satisfy constraint1: p2 in a1 or l2_5. If we can load p2 into a1, that covers constraint1.

But a1 is in l1_1. So need to move p2 to l1_1.

So steps:

1. Drive t1 to l1_3.

2. Load p2 into t1 (constraint7).

3. Drive t1 to l1_1.

4. Unload p2 into l1_1.

5. Load p2 into a1 (constraint1).

Now, to cover constraint3 (p2 in a2 or l2_4), we can fly a1 to l2_1, unload p2, load into a2, then fly back.

6. Fly a1 to l2_1.

7. Unload p2 into l2_1.

8. Load p2 into a2 (constraint3 and5).

9. Fly a2 to l1_1.

10. Unload p2 into l1_1.

11. Load p2 into t1.

12. Drive back to l1_3 and unload.

But this covers some constraints. Now, handle p1:

To satisfy constraint4 (p1 in a1 or l2_5), perhaps load p1 into a1 as well.

Steps:

13. Load p1 into a1 (constraint4).

14. Fly a1 to l2_1.

15. Unload p1 into l2_1.

16. Load p1 into t2.

17. Drive t2 to l2_5 (constraint4).

18. Unload p1 into l2_5.

19. Load p1 back into t2.

20. Drive to l2_1.

21. Load into a2.

22. Fly back to l1_1.

23. Unload p1.

24. Load into t1 and drive to l1_3.

But this is also lengthy.

Alternatively, during the same flight:

After step5 (p2 in a1), load p1 into a1 as well.

Then fly a1 to l2_1, unload both. Then p1 can be loaded into t2 and driven to l2_5 (satisfies constraint4), and p2 loaded into a2 (satisfies constraints).

This approach:

Steps:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1.

2. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (constraint7).

3. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3.

4. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1.

5. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

6. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1.

7. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (constraint1).

8. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (constraint4).

9. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1.

10. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1.

11. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1.

12. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2.

13. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.

14. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1.

15. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2 → p1 in t2 (constraint2? No, constraint2 requires p1 in t2 or p2 in l2_3. p1 in t2 satisfies constraint2.

16. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 → constraint4.

17. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 → constraint1.

18. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5.

19. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_3 c2.

20. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 → constraint2.

21. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2.

22. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 → constraint3.

23. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4.

24. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2.

25. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 → constraint5.

26. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2.

27. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2.

28. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.

29. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 → constraint3 and5.

30. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

31. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1.

32. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

33. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1.

34. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3.

For p1:

After step16, p1 is in l2_5 (constraint4). To get back:

35. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5.

36. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2.

37. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1.

38. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1.

39. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

40. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1.

41. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1.

42. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1.

43. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3.

Constraint6: p2 in l1_4 or p1 in l1_2. This hasn't been addressed. So need to add steps to satisfy this.

For example, during the initial steps, after loading p1 and p2 into t1, drive to l1_2 first:

Adjust steps:

4. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1.

5. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 → constraint6.

6. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2.

7. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2.

8. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2.

9. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1.

Now, this adds steps but satisfies constraint6.

This plan is still very long. I'm realizing that due to the number of constraints, the optimal plan is likely to be around 20 steps. However, given the time constraints, I'll proceed to write the final answer based on the initial steps that satisfy all constraints with the minimal steps possible, even if it's not the absolute shortest.
