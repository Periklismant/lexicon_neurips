Let me first understand the problem and organize the information.

We have:
- Locations: l1_1, l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5, l2_1, l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5
- Cities: c1, c2
- Packages: p1, p2
- Trucks: t1, t2
- Airplanes: a1, a2
- Airports: l1_1, l2_1

The initial state is:
- Locations l1_1, l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5 are in city c1
- Locations l2_1, l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5 are in city c2
- t1 is in location l1_2
- t2 is in location l2_3
- p1 is in location l1_4
- p2 is in location l1_1
- a1 is in location l1_1
- a2 is in location l2_1

**Oh, actually, I think there's a mistake in the initial state description. We're told that "Package t1", "Package t2", "Package a1", "Package a2" when these should be "Truck t1", "Truck t2", etc. I'm going to assume that the intended initial state is:

- Truck t1 is in location l1_2
- Truck t2 is in location l2_3
- Package p1 is in location l1_4
- Package p2 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

The goal is to get:
- p1 to l1_2
- p2 to l2_5

Additionally, there are several constraints that must be satisfied:
1. p1 must be in l2_5 at some point.
2. Either p2 is in a2 or p1 is in l2_5 at some point (but this is guaranteed by constraint 1, so we can ignore it).
3. p2 must be in either l1_5 or l2_2 at some point.
4. p1 must be in l1_4 at some point (this is already true in the initial state).
5. If p1 is in l1_4, then p2 must be in l2_1 at the same time or later.
6. p2 must be in l2_1 at some point.
7. If p2 is in l2_1, then p2 must have been in l1_5 earlier.
8. p1 must be in a2 at some point.
9. p1 must be in l2_2 at some point.

Let's map out a rough plan given these constraints:

1. Initially, p1 is in l1_4 (satisfying constraint 4).
2. We need to move p2 to l1_5 first (to satisfy constraint 7).
3. Then, we move p2 to l2_1 (satisfying constraints 5 and 6).
4. We need to move p1 to a2 (satisfying constraint 8).
5. We need to move p1 to l2_2 (satisfying constraint 9).
6. We need to move p1 to l2_5 (satisfying constraint 1).
7. Finally, we need to move p1 to l1_2 and p2 to l2_5 to achieve the goal.

Now, let's work out a detailed plan:

Initial state:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_2
- Truck t2 is in location l2_3
- Package p1 is in location l1_4
- Package p2 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

1. We need to move p2 from l1_1 to l1_5:
   - Move t1 from l1_2 to l1_1 to pick up p2.
   - Load p2 onto t1.
   - Move t1 from l1_1 to l1_5.
   - Unload p2 at l1_5.

2. We need to move p2 from l1_5 to l2_1:
   - Load p2 onto t1 at l1_5.
   - Move t1 from l1_5 to l1_1 (the airport in c1).
   - Unload p2 at l1_1.
   - Load p2 onto a1 at l1_1.
   - Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
   - Unload p2 at l2_1.

3. We need to move p1 from l1_4 to a2 (which is at l2_1):
   - Move t1 from l1_1 to l1_4 to pick up p1.
   - Load p1 onto t1.
   - Move t1 from l1_4 to l1_1.
   - Unload p1, transfering from truck to airplane.
   - Load p1 onto a1 at l1_1.
   - Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
   - Unload p1 at l2_1, transfering from a1 to a2.
   - (Actually, we might need to specify a more careful set of actions here, since we haven't made it clear how a package gets from one airplane to another. But we can transfer the package via the location.)
   - Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1.
   - Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1. (satisfying constraint 8)

4. We need to move p1 from a2 (at l2_1) to l2_2:
   - Unload p1 from a2 at l2_1.
   - Move t2 from l2_3 to l2_1.
   - Load p1 onto t2 at l2_1.
   - Move t2 from l2_1 to l2_2.
   - Unload p1 from t2 at l2_2. (satisfying constraint 9)

5. We need to move p1 from l2_2 to l2_5:
   - Load p1 onto t2 at l2_2.
   - Move t2 from l2_2 to l2_5.
   - Unload p1 from t2 at l2_5. (satisfying constraint 1)

6. We need to move p1 from l2_5 back to l1_2 (for the goal):
   - Load p1 onto t2 at l2_5.
   - Move t2 from l2_5 to l2_1.
   - Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1.
   - Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1.
   - Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
   - Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1.
   - Move t1 from l1_1 to l1_2 (or wherever t1 is).
   - Load p1 onto t1 at l1_1.
   - Move t1 from l1_1 to l1_2.
   - Unload p1 from t1 at l1_2. (achieving part of the goal)

7. We need to move p2 from l2_1 to l2_5 (for the goal):
   - (p2 is already at l2_1 from step 2)
   - Load p2 onto t2 at l2_1 (if t2 is there, or move it there first).
   - Move t2 from l2_1 to l2_5.
   - Unload p2 from t2 at l2_5. (achieving the other part of the goal)

Let me review this plan for correctness and see if we can make it more efficient:

Actually, we might have to revisit our plan to make sure all constraints are satisfied in the right order. We have constraint 5 that states "If p1 is in l1_4, then p2 must be in l2_1 at the same time or later."

But initially, p1 is in l1_4, and p2 is not in l2_1. So, we have to ensure that p2 gets to l2_1 as part of the plan. However, constraint 7 states "If p2 is in l2_1, then p2 must have been in l1_5 earlier." So, we need to route p2 through l1_5 before it reaches l2_1.

Also, let's be careful about the current locations of things. For example, after step 2, a1 is at l2_1, not at l1_1 as we assumed in step 3.

Let's redraw this plan with more careful tracking of the locations of all items throughout.

Initial state:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_2
- Truck t2 is in location l2_3
- Package p1 is in location l1_4 (satisfying constraint 4)
- Package p2 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

Let's  trace the plan with more precise actions:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 (Move t1 to pick up p2)
2. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (Load p2 onto t1)
3. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1 (Move t1 to l1_5, satisfying constraint 7 by bringing p2 to l1_5)
4. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 (Unload p2 at l1_5, satisfying constraint 3)
5. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 (Load p2 back onto t1)
6. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1 (Move t1 back to the airport)
7. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (Unload p2 at the airport)
8. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (Load p2 onto a1)
9. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (Fly a1 to the other airport)
10. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (Unload p2 at l2_1, satisfying constraints 5 and 6)

At this point, t1 is at l1_1, t2 is at l2_3, p1 is at l1_4, p2 is at l2_1, a1 is at l2_1, and a2 is at l2_1.

11. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1 (Move t1 to pick up p1)
12. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4 (Load p1 onto t1)
13. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 (Move t1 back to the airport)
14. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (Unload p1 at the airport)
15. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (Load p1 onto a1)

Oops, I realize I made a mistake. a1 is currently at l2_1, not at l1_1. Let's go back to step the point where a1 is at l2_1.

Actually, I need to rethink the plan a bit more deeply.

After step 10, we have:
- t1 is at l1_1
- t2 is at l2_3
- p1 is at l1_4
- p2 is at l2_1 (satisfying constraints 5 and 6)
- a1 is at l2_1
- a2 is at l2_1

We still need to satisfy constraints 1, 8, and 9, which pertain to p1, and then achieve the final goal.

Let's continue the plan:

11. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1 (Move t1 to pick up p1)
12. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4 (Load p1 onto t1)
13. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 (Move t1 back to the airport)
14. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (Unload p1 at the airport)
15. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (Oops, a1 is not at l1_1 currently)

Let's adjust:

11. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1 (Move t1 to pick up p1)
12. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4 (Load p1 onto t1)
13. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 (Move t1 back to the airport)
14. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (Unload p1 at the airport)
15. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1 (Fly a1 back to the initial airport)
16. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (Load p1 onto a1)
17. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (Fly a1 to the other airport)
18. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 (Unload p1 at l2_1)
19. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (Load p1 onto a2, satisfying constraint 8)
20. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (Unload p1 from a2)
21. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2 (Move t2 to pick up p1)
22. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (Load p1 onto t2)
23. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2 (Move t2 to l2_2)
24. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (Unload p1 at l2_2, satisfying constraint 9)
25. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (Load p1 back onto t2)
26. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2 (Move t2 to l2_5)
27. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (Unload p1 at l2_5, satisfying constraint 1)

At this point, t1 is at l1_1, t2 is at l2_5, p1 is at l2_5, p2 is at l2_1, a1 is at l2_1, and a2 is at l2_1.

We're getting closer to the goal. We need to:
1. Move p1 from l2_5 to l1_2
2. Move p2 from l2_1 to l2_5

Let's continue:

28. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (Load p1 back onto t2)
29. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 (Move t2 back to the airport)
30. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (Unload p1 at the airport)
31. loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 (Load p1 onto a1)
32. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1 (Fly a1 to the other airport)
33. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (Unload p1 at l1_1)
34. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1 (Move t1 to the goal location for p1)
35. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (Load p1 onto t1)
36. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1 (Move t1 to the goal location for p1)
37. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 (Unload p1 at l1_2, achieving the first part of the goal)

At this point, t1 is at l1_2, t2 is at l2_1, p1 is at l1_2, p2 is at l2_1, a1 is at l1_1, and a2 is at l2_1.

38. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (Load p2 onto t2)
39. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2 (Move t2 to the goal location for p2)
40. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 (Unload p2 at l2_5, achieving the second part of the goal)

At this point, t1 is at l1_2, t2 is at l2_5, p1 is at l1_2, p2 is at l2_5, a1 is at l1_1, and a2 is at l2_1. Both parts of the goal have been achieved.

Wait, I'm getting ahead of myself and repeating some steps. Let me verify (for example, the repetitions of 34-36). Let me re-trace the plan and make sure I'm not introducing redundancies.

Actually, I think steps 34-36 are redundant because I've got t1 moving to l1_2 in step 34, and then again in step 36. Let me verify by going through the plan step-by-step again.

After step 33, we have:
- t1 is at l1_1
- t2 is at l2_1
- p1 is at l1_1 (just unloaded from a1)
- p2 is at l2_1
- a1 is at l1_1
- a2 is at l2_1

So, the corrected steps would be:
34. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (Load p1 onto t1)
35. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1 (Move t1 to the goal location for p1)
36. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 (Unload p1 at l1_2, achieving the first part of the goal)

OK, let's put together a full, detailed plan that meets all constraints and achieves the goal state. I'll keep track of the locations of all items after each step.

Initial state:
- t1 is at l1_2
- t2 is at l2_3
- p1 is at l1_4 (satisfying constraint 4)
- p2 is at l1_1
- a1 is at l1_1
- a2 is at l2_1

Plan:
1. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 (Move t1 to pick up p2)
2. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (Load p2 onto t1)
3. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1 (Move t1 to l1_5, to satisfy constraint 7)
4. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 (Unload p2 at l1_5, satisfying constraint 3 and to satisfy constraint 7 in the future)
5. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 (Load p2 back onto t1)
6. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1 (Move t1 back to the airport)
7. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (Unload p2 at the airport)
8. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (Load p2 onto a1)
9. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (Fly a1 to the other airport)
10. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (Unload p2 at l2_1, satisfying constraints 5 and 6)

At this point, t1 is at l1_1, t2 is at l2_3, p1 is at l1_4, p2 is at l2_1, a1 is at l2_1, and a2 is at l2_1.

11. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1 (Fly a1 back to the other airport)
12. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1 (Move t1 to pick up p1)
13. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4 (Load p1 onto t1)
14. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 (Move t1 back to the airport)
15. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (Unload p1 at the airport)
16. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (Load p1 onto a1)
17. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (Fly a1 to the other airport)
18. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 (Unload p1 at l2_1)
19. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (Load p1 onto a2, satisfying constraint 8)
20. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (Unload p1 from a2)

At this point, t1 is at l1_1, t2 is at l2_3, p1 is at l2_1, p2 is at l2_1, a1 is at l2_1, and a2 is at l2_1.

21. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2 (Move t2 to pick up p1)
22. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (Load p1 onto t2)
23. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2 (Move t2 to l2_2)
24. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (Unload p1 at l2_2, satisfying constraint 9)
25. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (Load p1 back onto t2)
26. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2 (Move t2 to l2_5)
27. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (Unload p1 at l2_5, satisfying constraint 1 and 2)

At this point, t1 is at l1_1, t2 is at l2_5, p1 is at l2_5, p2 is at l2_1, a1 is at l2_1, and a2 is at l2_1.

28. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (Load p1 back onto t2)
29. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 (Move t2 back to the airport)
30. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (Unload p1 at the airport)
31. loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 (Load p1 onto a1)
32. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1 (Fly a1 to the other airport)
33. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (Unload p1 at l1_1)
34. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (Load p1 onto t1)
35. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1 (Move t1 to the goal location for p1)
36. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 (Unload p1 at l1_2, achieving the first part of the goal)

At this point, t1 is at l1_2, t2 is at l2_1, p1 is at l1_2 (goal achieved), p2 is at l2_1, a1 is at l1_1, and a2 is at l2_1.

37. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (Load p2 onto t2)
38. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2 (Move t2 to the goal location for p2)
39. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 (Unload p2 at l2_5, achieving the second part of the goal)

At this point, t1 is at l1_2, t2 is at l2_5, p1 is at l1_2, p2 is at l2_5, a1 is at l1_1, and a2 is at l2_1. Both parts of the goal have been achieved, and all constraints have been satisfied.

Let me double-check this plan against the constraints:

1. p1 is in l2_5 (satisfied in step 27)
2. Either p2 is in a2 or p1 is in l2_5 (satisfied because of constraint 1)
3. p2 is in either l1_5 or l2_2 (satisfied in step 4, where p2 is in l1_5)
4. p1 is in l1_4 (satisfied in the initial state)
5. If p1 is in l1_4, then p2 is in l2_1 at the same time or later (satisfied because p1 is initially in l1_4, and p2 is at l2_1 after step 10)
6. p2 is in l2_1 (satisfied in step 10)
7. If p2 is in l2_1, then p2 has been in l1_5 earlier (satisfied because p2 is at l1_5 in step 4 before it is at l2_1 in step 10)
8. p1 is in a2 (satisfied in step 19)
9. p1 is in l2_2 (satisfied in step 24)

The plan seems to satisfy all constraints. Now, let's check for optimality.

I'm wondering if steps 19 and 20 (loading p1 onto a2 and then immediately unloading it) can be optimized. The purpose of these steps is to satisfy constraint 8 (p1 must be in a2 at some point). But since a2 is at l2_1, we can't really avoid these steps if we want to satisfy all constraints.

Actually, wait. No one said that a2 has to stay at l2_1. Maybe we can fly a2 to another location that p1 will visit, and this could save us some steps. But loading and unloading p1 from a2 takes two steps, and a2 is already at l2_1. So, loading p1 onto a2 at l2_1 and then immediately unloading it seem like the most efficient steps to satisfy constraint 8.

I also wondered if we could remove steps 11 (flying a1 back to l1_1). The alternative would be to drive t1 to l2_1 to pick up p1, but this would involve crossing from city c1 to city c2, which isn't allowed. So, it seems like we need to fly a1 back to transport p1.

I've gone through the plan again, and I don't see any redundancies or inefficiencies. The given plan seems optimal to me.

However, I just realized a potential issue with the above plan. I've assumed that we can drive from any location in a city to any other location in the same city. But the problem statement mentions specific locations in each city, and there might be specific roads between them. Let me go back and check the specifications.

Actually, no such restrictions mentioned. So the above plan should work assuming that one can drive from any location to any other location within a given city.

I believe the final plan is optimal, as each step serves a purpose in either achieving the goal or satisfying a constraint, and there doesn't seem to be a way to achieve the same with fewer steps.

Actually, let me double-check the loadairplane and unloadairplane actions. I've been writing them as "loadairplane p ap l" and "loadairplane p ap l", but the problem statement gives the latter as "unloadairplane p ap l". I'll correct it in the final plan.

Given the corrections, here's the final plan:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 (Move t1 to pick up p2)
2. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (Load p2 onto t1)
3. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1 (Move t1 to l1_5, to satisfy constraint 7)
4. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 (Unload p2 at l1_5, satisfying constraint 3 and to satisfy constraint 7 in the future)
5. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 (Load p2 back onto t1)
6. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1 (Move t1 back to the airport)
7. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (Unload p2 at the airport)
8. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (Load p2 onto a1)
9. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (Fly a1 to the other airport)
10. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (Unload p2 at l2_1, satisfying constraints 5 and 6)
11. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1 (Fly a1 back to the other airport)
12. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1 (Move t1 to pick up p1)
13. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4 (Load p1 onto t1)
14. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 (Move t1 back to the airport)
15. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (Unload p1 at the airport)
16. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (Load p1 onto a1)
17. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (Fly a1 to the other airport)
18. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 (Unload p1 at l2_1)
19. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (Load p1 onto a2, satisfying constraint 8)
20. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (Unload p1 from a2)
21. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2 (Move t2 to pick up p1)
22. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (Load p1 onto t2)
23. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2 (Move t2 to l2_2)
24. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (Unload p1 at l2_2, satisfying constraint 9)
25. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (Load p1 back onto t2)
26. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2 (Move t2 to l2_5)
27. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (Unload p1 at l2_5, satisfying constraint 1 and 2)
28. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (Load p1 back onto t2)
29. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 (Move t2 back to the airport)
30. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (Unload p1 at the airport)
31. loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 (Load p1 onto a1)
32. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1 (Fly a1 to the other airport)
33. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (Unload p1 at l1_1)
34. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (Load p1 onto t1)
35. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1 (Move t1 to the goal location for p1)
36. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 (Unload p1 at l1_2, achieving the first part of the goal)
37. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (Load p2 onto t2)
38. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2 (Move t2 to the goal location for p2)
39. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 (Unload p2 at l2_5, achieving the second part of the goal)

This double-checked plan should solve the problem optimally, satisfying all constraints and achieving the goal state.

Actually, after further examination, there are several things in the problem statement that I should scrutinize a bit more. A couple of concerns:

1. There seems to be a mix-up in the description of the loading/unloading airplane actions. The problem mentions "loadairplane p ap l" for loading and "loadairplane p ap l" for unloading, which are identical. I'm assuming, based on context, that the unloading action should be "unloadairplane p ap l".

2. The initial state has some issues. It says "Package t1 is in location l1_2", "Package t2 is in location l2_3", "Package a1 is in location l1_1", "Package a2 is in location l2_1". These should, I think, be "Truck t1 is in location l1_2", "Truck t2 is in location l2_3", "Airplane a1 is in location l1_1", "Airplane a2 is in location l2_1" since t1 and t2 are defined as trucks, and a1 and a2 are defined as airplanes.

I think it's probably most sensible to proceed under the assumption that:
- t1 and t2 are trucks and a1 and a2 are airplanes.
- The initial locations are as given: t1 at l1_2, t2 at l2_3, a1 at l1_1, a2 at l2_1, p1 at l1_4, p2 at l1_1.
- The action for unloading from an airplane is "unloadairplane p ap l".

Let me review the problem once more, and ensure this is the most reasonable interpretation.

I've decided that my interpretation is the most reasonable one given the context, and the plan provided should solve the problem optimally, satisfying all constraints and achieving the goal state.

Here's the final solution:
