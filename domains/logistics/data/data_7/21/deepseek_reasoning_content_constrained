Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. The goal is to get p1 to l1_2 and p2 to l2_5, but there are a bunch of constraints to satisfy. Hmm. Let me start by understanding the initial state and the requirements.

First, the initial state: 

- Locations in c1: l1_1 (airport), l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5.
- Locations in c2: l2_1 (airport), l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5.
- Packages: p1 is at l1_4 (c1), p2 is at l1_1 (c1's airport). Wait, the original state says "Package t1 is in location l1_2", but t1 is a truck, right? Oh, maybe that's a typo. Wait, looking back, the objects include "truck t1", "truck t2", so the original state probably has "Truck t1 is in location l1_2" and similarly for t2. Because otherwise, packages named t1 and t2 would be confusing. But the user wrote "Package t1 is in location l1_2". That's a mistake, right? Or maybe it's a typo in the problem statement. Wait, the user provided the original state as:

"Package t1 is in location l1_2"
"Package t2 is in location l2_3"
"Package p1 is in location l1_4"
"Package p2 is in location l1_1"
"Package a1 is in location l1_1"
"Package a2 is in location l2_1"

Wait, that can't be right. Because a1 and a2 are airplanes, not packages. So maybe that's a mistake. But the problem says "The world includes the following objects" and lists "package p1", "package p2", "truck t1", "truck t2", "airplane a1", "airplane a2". So in the original state, the "Package t1" and "Package t2" must be errors. The user probably meant "Truck t1 is in l1_2" and "Truck t2 is in l2_3". Similarly, "Package a1" and "Package a2" should be airplanes. So maybe it's a typo. But since the user provided that, perhaps I need to take it as given. Wait, but that would conflict because airplanes are supposed to be at airports. Let me check again.

Wait, the original state says:

"Package t1 is in location l1_2" – but t1 is a truck. So maybe that's a typo. The same for "Package t2 is in location l2_3". And "Package a1 is in location l1_1" – a1 is an airplane, so it should be at an airport. But according to the problem statement, airports are locations in each city, so l1_1 is an airport in c1, and l2_1 is an airport in c2.

So perhaps the original state is written with errors. For example, "Truck t1 is in l1_2", "Truck t2 is in l2_3", "Airplane a1 is in l1_1", "Airplane a2 is in l2_1". Because otherwise, if a1 is a package, that would be wrong. So I think there's a typo in the original state. Let's assume that the user made a mistake in writing "Package" instead of "Truck" or "Airplane" for t1, t2, a1, a2. Otherwise, the problem is impossible.

So correcting that:

Original state:

- Truck t1 is in l1_2 (city c1)
- Truck t2 is in l2_3 (city c2)
- Package p1 is in l1_4 (c1)
- Package p2 is in l1_1 (c1's airport)
- Airplane a1 is in l1_1 (c1's airport)
- Airplane a2 is in l2_1 (c2's airport)

That makes more sense. So the initial positions:

- Trucks: t1 in c1's l1_2, t2 in c2's l2_3.
- Airplanes: a1 in c1's l1_1 (airport), a2 in c2's l2_1 (airport).
- Packages: p1 at l1_4 (c1), p2 at l1_1 (c1's airport). Wait, but p2 is at l1_1, which is an airport, so maybe we can load it into airplane a1, which is also at l1_1.

The goal is to have p1 in l1_2 and p2 in l2_5.

Constraints:

1. At least once, p1 is in l2_5.
2. At least once, p2 is in a2 or p1 is in l2_5.
3. At least once, p2 is in l1_5 or l2_2.
4. At least once, p1 is in l1_4 (which is its initial location, so maybe this is already satisfied, but need to check if the initial state counts. The problem says "must hold in at least one state", so initial state is a state. So perhaps this constraint is already met. But maybe the plan needs to include that state. Wait, the initial state is before any actions. So if the initial state already has p1 in l1_4, then that constraint is satisfied. So that's covered.

But wait, the problem states that the constraints must hold in the plan. So if the initial state is considered, then that constraint is already satisfied. But the user might require that the constraint is met during the execution of the plan. However, the problem statement says "must hold in at least one state", which includes the initial state. So for constraint 4, it's already satisfied. But need to confirm.

Then, constraint 5: If p1 is in l1_4 in some state s, then p2 must be in l2_1 in s or after. But since p1 starts in l1_4, the initial state s0 has p1 in l1_4. Therefore, we need to ensure that p2 is in l2_1 at s0 or after. The initial position of p2 is l1_1 (c1's airport). So we need to get p2 to l2_1 at some point. But l2_1 is in c2, so we need to transport p2 from c1 to c2. That would require using an airplane.

Constraint 6: At least once, p2 is in l2_1. So we need to get p2 to l2_1, which is the airport of c2. Since a2 is there, maybe we can unload p2 there.

Constraint 7: If p2 is in l2_1 in some state, then there must be an earlier state where p2 was in l1_5. So we need to get p2 to l1_5 first, then to l2_1.

Constraint 8: At least once, p1 is in a2. So p1 must be loaded into airplane a2.

Constraint 9: At least once, p1 is in l2_2. So p1 must be in l2_2 (c2's location). 

Now, the goal is p1 in l1_2 and p2 in l2_5. 

So let's outline the steps.

First, handle p2. Since p2 needs to end up in l2_5 (c2), and it starts in l1_1 (c1's airport). To move it to c2, we can use airplane a1 (which is in l1_1) to fly to l2_1. But first, we need to load p2 into a1 at l1_1.

So steps for p2:

1. Load p2 into a1 at l1_1 (loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1)
2. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1 (flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1)
3. Unload p2 from a1 at l2_1 (unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1)
   Now p2 is at l2_1, which is in c2. But the goal is l2_5. So we need to move it within c2. Since there's truck t2 in l2_3. Let's see where l2_3 is. The truck is in l2_3 (c2). So we can drive t2 to l2_1, but wait, the cities have locations l2_1 (airport), l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5. So in c2, the truck t2 is at l2_3. To get to l2_1 (airport), the truck can drive from l2_3 to l2_1 via other locations? Wait, the drivetruck action requires moving between locations in the same city. So the truck can drive between any two locations in its city, but need to check the connectivity. But the problem statement doesn't specify any road connections, so we assume that any two locations in a city are connected. So the truck can drive from l2_3 to l2_1 directly? Or perhaps via intermediate steps. Wait, the drivetruck action allows moving from l_from to l_to in the same city. So the truck can go directly from l2_3 to l2_1 in one action. So t2 can drive to l2_1, load p2, then drive to l2_5.

But first, p2 is at l2_1 after being unloaded from a1. So steps:

3. Unload p2 from a1 at l2_1 (now p2 is in l2_1)
4. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1 (drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2)
5. Load p2 into t2 at l2_1 (loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1)
6. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_5 (drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2)
7. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_5 (unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5)

This would get p2 to its goal. But there are constraints related to p2:

Constraint 7: If p2 is in l2_1 (which it is after step 3), then there must be an earlier state where p2 was in l1_5. So we need to get p2 to l1_5 before it reaches l2_1. But how? Because p2 starts in l1_1 (c1's airport). To get to l1_5, which is in c1, we can use truck t1, which is at l1_2. So:

Wait, but p2 is initially at l1_1. To get it to l1_5, we can use truck t1. But t1 is at l1_2. So we need to drive t1 to l1_1, load p2, then drive to l1_5.

But wait, p2 is in l1_1, which is an airport in c1. So the steps would be:

- Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1 (drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1)
- Load p2 into t1 at l1_1 (loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1)
- Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_5 (drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1)
- Unload p2 in l1_5 (unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5)
Then, to get p2 back to l1_1 to load into the airplane. Because after unloading in l1_5, p2 is there. Then we need to transport it back to l1_1 to load into a1. So:

But that's a lot of steps, but necessary to satisfy constraint 7. Because after p2 is in l1_5 (state s), then later when p2 is in l2_1 (state after step 3), the constraint is satisfied.

So integrating this into the plan:

For p2:

Original position: l1_1.

Steps:

1. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1 (c1)
2. Load p2 into t1 at l1_1
3. Drive t1 to l1_5 (c1)
4. Unload p2 in l1_5 (satisfies constraint 3, since p2 is in l1_5)
   Now, constraint 7 is satisfied because p2 was in l1_5 before being in l2_1.
5. Now, need to get p2 back to l1_1 to load into a1. So drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_1.
6. Load p2 into t1 again? Wait, no. Wait, after step 4, p2 is in l1_5. To get it back to l1_1, we need to load it into t1 again. So:

5. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_1 (drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1)
6. Load p2 into t1 at l1_1 (loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1)
7. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_1? No. Wait, t1 is already at l1_1. Wait, after step 5, t1 is at l1_1. So to get p2 back to l1_1, we need to load it into t1 at l1_5, drive to l1_1, then unload. Wait, but after step 4, p2 is at l1_5. So:

Wait, after step 4: p2 is in l1_5, t1 is at l1_5. So steps 5-7:

5. Load p2 into t1 at l1_5 (loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5)
6. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_1 (drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1)
7. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1 (unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1)
Now p2 is back at l1_1, which is where it started. Then we can load it into a1 and fly to c2.

But this seems like a lot of steps. But necessary to satisfy constraint 7.

Then proceed with the original plan for p2:

8. Load p2 into a1 at l1_1 (loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1)
9. Fly a1 to l2_1 (flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1)
10. Unload p2 from a1 at l2_1 (now p2 is in l2_1, satisfying constraint 6)
11. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1 (drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2)
12. Load p2 into t2 at l2_1 (loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1)
13. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_5 (drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2)
14. Unload p2 at l2_5 (unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5) – this meets the goal for p2.

Now for p1: the goal is to get it to l1_2. It starts at l1_4 (c1). The truck t1 is in l1_1 after step 7. So after step 7, t1 is at l1_1. To move p1 from l1_4 to l1_2, we can use truck t1.

But after step 7, t1 is at l1_1. So steps for p1:

15. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_4 (drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1)
16. Load p1 into t1 (loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4)
17. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_2 (drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1)
18. Unload p1 at l1_2 (unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2) – this meets the goal for p1.

But wait, there are constraints related to p1:

Constraints:

1. p1 must be in l2_5 at least once.
8. p1 must be in a2 at least once.
9. p1 must be in l2_2 at least once.

Also, constraint 2: at least once, p2 is in a2 or p1 is in l2_5. So either one of these must be true. Since constraint 1 requires p1 to be in l2_5, which would satisfy constraint 2 as well. So if we satisfy constraint 1, constraint 2 is also satisfied.

But how to get p1 to l2_5. Also, need to get p1 into a2 (constraint 8) and into l2_2 (constraint 9).

So p1's journey is more complex. Let's think.

p1 starts at l1_4 (c1). Need to get it to l1_2 (goal), but also needs to be in l2_5 (which is in c2), a2 (airplane in c2's airport l2_1), and l2_2 (c2's location).

So, the plan must involve transporting p1 to c2, then back to c1. But how?

Let me outline:

To get p1 to c2, we need to use an airplane. The airplanes are a1 (initially in l1_1) and a2 (in l2_1). So perhaps:

- Load p1 into a1 at l1_1, fly to l2_1, unload, then load into a2, fly to another airport? But a2 is already in l2_1. Wait, maybe not. Let's think.

Wait, a2 is in l2_1 (c2's airport). So to get p1 into a2, we need to have p1 at l2_1. So how to get p1 there.

Alternatively, use a1 to fly p1 to l2_1, then load into a2. But then a1 is in l2_1 after flying. But after that, a1 can fly back.

So steps for p1:

From l1_4, move to l1_1 via truck t1.

But the existing plan for p1 (steps 15-18) is to drive t1 to l1_4, load p1, then drive to l1_2. But that doesn't involve getting p1 to c2. So that plan won't satisfy the constraints.

So we need to adjust the plan to include transporting p1 to c2.

Alternative approach for p1:

1. Use truck t1 to move p1 from l1_4 to l1_1 (airport), load into a1, fly to l2_1 (c2's airport), unload. Then, p1 is in l2_1. Then load into a2 (which is at l2_1), fly to another location? Wait, but the constraints require p1 to be in a2 and in l2_2 and in l2_5.

So:

- After unloading p1 from a1 at l2_1, we can load it into a2 (so p1 is in a2, satisfying constraint 8). Then fly a2 to l2_2? Wait, no, airplanes can only fly between airports. Wait, l2_2 is not an airport. Airplanes can only move between airports. So l2_1 is the only airport in c2. So a2 can't fly to l2_2. Therefore, to get p1 to l2_2 (c2), we need to use a truck in c2. But the truck in c2 is t2, which is at l2_3 initially, but after steps 11-14, t2 is at l2_5.

Wait, let's retrace. For p2, t2 was driven from l2_3 to l2_1 (step 11), then to l2_5 (step 13). So after step 13, t2 is at l2_5. So to use t2 to move p1 from l2_1 to l2_2, but l2_1 is in c2. So steps:

After p1 is unloaded from a1 at l2_1 (step x), load into t2 (but t2 is at l2_5). So maybe drive t2 back to l2_1.

But this is getting complicated. Let me try to outline the steps for p1:

To satisfy the constraints:

- p1 must be in l2_5 (constraint 1)
- p1 must be in a2 (constraint 8)
- p1 must be in l2_2 (constraint 9)

So possible plan for p1:

a. Move p1 from l1_4 to l1_1 (using truck t1)
b. Load p1 into a1, fly to l2_1 (c2's airport)
c. Unload p1 at l2_1
d. Load p1 into a2 (since a2 is at l2_1), satisfying constraint 8
e. Fly a2 to some airport. But a2 can only fly to other airports. Since there are two cities, perhaps fly back to l1_1? But that's in c1. But a2 is in c2's airport. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1 (assuming that's allowed, even though cities are different. The flyairplane action allows flying between any two airports, regardless of city. So yes.

Wait, the flyairplane action's precondition is that the airplane is at l_from. So after loading p1 into a2 at l2_1, fly a2 to l1_1 (c1's airport), unload p1 there. Then, use truck t1 to move p1 to l1_2. But that would complicate things. Alternatively, after step d (p1 in a2), fly a2 to l2_1 (but that's the same location). Alternatively, fly to another airport. Wait, there are only two airports: l1_1 and l2_1.

Alternatively, after loading p1 into a2, fly a2 to l2_1 (no movement). That doesn't help. So perhaps after loading p1 into a2, unload it at l2_1, then use truck t2 to move it to l2_2 and l2_5.

But truck t2 is at l2_5 after delivering p2. So perhaps:

After step 14 (p2 is at l2_5), drive t2 back to l2_1:

15. Drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
16. Load p1 into t2 at l2_1
17. Drive t2 to l2_2 (drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2)
18. Unload p1 at l2_2 (satisfies constraint 9)
19. Load p1 into t2 again
20. Drive to l2_5, unload (satisfies constraint 1)
21. Then, to get p1 back to c1's l1_2, we need to fly it back. So load p1 into a2 again at l2_5? Wait, no. l2_5 is not an airport. So to fly p1 back, we need to get it to an airport. So after step 20, p1 is in l2_5. Then, drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (airport), load p1 into a2, fly a2 to l1_1, unload, then use truck t1 to take it to l1_2.

This is getting very long. But let's see if we can fit all the constraints.

But this plan would have many steps. The problem asks for an optimal plan, which is as short as possible. So perhaps there's a smarter way.

Alternative idea: Use a1 to transport p1 to l2_1, then use t2 to move it to l2_2 and l2_5. But we need to also get p1 into a2. So:

Steps for p1:

- Drive t1 from l1_2 (initial position) to l1_4 (where p1 is)
- Load p1 into t1
- Drive to l1_1 (airport)
- Unload p1 at l1_1
- Load into a1
- Fly a1 to l2_1 (c2's airport)
- Unload p1 at l2_1 (now in c2)
- Load p1 into a2 (satisfies constraint 8)
- Unload p1 from a2 (still at l2_1)
- Load p1 into t2 (drive t2 to l2_1 if not already there)
- Drive t2 to l2_2, unload (satisfies constraint 9)
- Load p1 again, drive to l2_5, unload (satisfies constraint 1)
- Then, to get p1 back to l1_2, load into a2, fly to l1_1, unload, load into t1, drive to l1_2.

But this involves many steps. Let's see if it can be optimized.

Alternatively, after p1 is in l2_5 (satisfying constraint 1), we can fly it back using a2. But l2_5 is not an airport. So we need to move it to l2_1 first.

But perhaps combining steps:

For p1:

1. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_4 (drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1)
2. Load p1 into t1 (loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4)
3. Drive t1 to l1_1 (drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1)
4. Unload p1 (unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1)
5. Load p1 into a1 (loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1)
6. Fly a1 to l2_1 (flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1)
7. Unload p1 (unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1)
8. Load p1 into a2 (loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1) – now constraint 8 is satisfied.
9. Fly a2 to l2_1 (no movement) – no, need to fly to another airport. Fly a2 to l1_1.
10. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1 (flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1)
11. Unload p1 (unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1)
12. Load p1 into t1 (which is at l1_1)
13. Drive t1 to l1_2, unload (goal achieved)

But this way, when is p1 in l2_5? It hasn't been there yet. So need to adjust.

Alternatively, after step 7 (p1 in l2_1), use t2 to move it to l2_2 and l2_5.

But t2 is initially at l2_3. After delivering p2 to l2_5, t2 is there. So perhaps after step 14 (p2 at l2_5), drive t2 back to l2_1.

But let's integrate all steps.

Combining p2 and p1's steps:

For p2:

1. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1 (c1)
2. Load p2 into t1 (l1_1)
3. Drive t1 to l1_5 (c1)
4. Unload p2 at l1_5 (constraint 3 and 7)
5. Load p2 into t1 again
6. Drive t1 back to l1_1
7. Unload p2 at l1_1
8. Load p2 into a1 (l1_1)
9. Fly a1 to l2_1
10. Unload p2 at l2_1 (constraint 6)
11. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1 (c2)
12. Load p2 into t2
13. Drive to l2_5, unload (goal)

For p1:

14. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_4 (c1)
15. Load p1 into t1
16. Drive to l1_1, unload
17. Load into a1
18. Fly a1 to l2_1
19. Unload p1 at l2_1
20. Load p1 into a2 (constraint 8)
21. Unload p1 from a2 (still at l2_1)
22. Load into t2 (after step 13, t2 is at l2_5. Need to drive back to l2_1)
23. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (c2)
24. Load p1 into t2
25. Drive to l2_2, unload (constraint 9)
26. Load p1 into t2 again
27. Drive to l2_5, unload (constraint 1)
28. Load p1 into a2 (l2_1 is airport. So drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1)
29. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (c2)
30. Load p1 into t2 (if it's at l2_1)
31. Unload at l2_1, load into a2
32. Fly a2 to l1_1
33. Unload p1 into l1_1
34. Load into t1, drive to l1_2, unload (goal)

This is very lengthy and not optimal. There must be a shorter way.

Alternative approach: Use a2 to transport p1. Since a2 is in l2_1 initially. But p1 is in c1. So first, fly a2 to l1_1, load p1, then fly back.

But a2 starts in l2_1. So:

- Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1 (flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1)
- Load p1 into a2 (l1_1)
- Fly a2 back to l2_1
- Unload p1 into l2_1 (now p1 is in c2)
- Then use t2 to move it to l2_2 and l2_5.

But how to get p1 into a2 (which is required by constraint 8). Loading into a2 at l1_1 would satisfy that.

So steps:

For p1:

1. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1 (flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1)
2. Load p1 into a2 (loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1) – satisfies constraint 8
3. Fly a2 back to l2_1 (flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1)
4. Unload p1 at l2_1
5. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1 (c2)
6. Load p1 into t2
7. Drive to l2_2, unload (constraint 9)
8. Load p1 into t2 again
9. Drive to l2_5, unload (constraint 1 and goal)
10. Then, to get p1 back to l1_2: Fly a2 to l1_1 again, but p1 is in l2_5. So need to drive t2 back to l2_1, load into a2, fly to l1_1, unload, load into t1, drive to l1_2.

This would add steps:

11. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (c2)
12. Load p1 into t2
13. Unload at l2_1, load into a2
14. Fly a2 to l1_1
15. Unload p1
16. Load into t1, drive to l1_2.

But this is also many steps.

But maybe there's a way to combine steps. For example, when a2 is flying to l1_1 to get p1, and after delivering p1 to l2_5, fly back again.

But the problem requires the optimal (shortest) plan. So let's see if we can find a minimal path.

Let me try to outline the steps for both packages, ensuring all constraints are met.

First, handling p2's constraints:

- Must visit l1_5 before l2_1.
- Must be in l2_1.
- Goal is l2_5.

For p2:

1. Use t1 to move p2 from l1_1 to l1_5 (via steps: drive t1 to l1_1, load, drive to l1_5, unload)
2. Then, drive t1 back to l1_1, load p2, unload at l1_1.
3. Load into a1, fly to l2_1.
4. Unload p2, then use t2 to move to l2_5.

Steps:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
2. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
3. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
4. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 (constraint 3 met)
5. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
6. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
7. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (now p2 is back at l1_1)
8. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
9. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
10. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (constraint 6 met, and constraint 7 satisfied because previous state had p2 in l1_5)
11. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
12. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
13. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
14. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 (goal met)

Now, p1's constraints:

- Must be in l2_5 (constraint 1)
- Must be in a2 (constraint 8)
- Must be in l2_2 (constraint 9)
- Also, constraint 2 is satisfied if p1 is in l2_5
- constraint 4 is already satisfied by initial state.

Additionally, constraint 5: if p1 is in l1_4 (which it is in the initial state), then p2 must be in l2_1 at or after that state. Since p2 is in l2_1 after step 10, this is satisfied.

Now, handling p1's steps:

p1 starts at l1_4. Need to get it to l1_2 (goal), but also to l2_5, a2, and l2_2.

Possible steps:

15. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1 (t1 is at l1_1 after step 7)
16. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
17. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
18. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
19. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
20. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
21. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
22. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (constraint 8 met)
23. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l2_1 (no, can't fly to same location. Need to fly to another airport. So fly to l1_1)
24. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
25. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (now p1 is back in c1)
26. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
27. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
28. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 (goal met)

But this doesn't satisfy p1's constraints to be in l2_5 and l2_2. So this approach misses those.

Alternative approach: After step 21 (p1 in l2_1), use t2 to move it to l2_2 and l2_5.

But t2 is at l2_5 after step 14. So drive t2 back to l2_1.

15. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
16. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
17. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
18. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (constraint 9 met)
19. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
20. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
21. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (constraint 1 met)
22. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_5 – but l2_5 is not an airport. So can't load into airplane here. Need to move back to l2_1.

23. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
24. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
25. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (constraint 8)
26. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
27. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
28. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
29. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
30. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 (goal)

But this adds many steps. But perhaps this is the minimal way to satisfy all constraints.

Now, let's check all constraints:

1. p1 in l2_5: step 21
2. p2 in a2 or p1 in l2_5: step 21 covers it
3. p2 in l1_5 or l2_2: step 4 (p2 in l1_5)
4. p1 in l1_4: initial state
5. If p1 is in l1_4 (initial state), then p2 must be in l2_1 after. p2 is in l2_1 after step 10
6. p2 in l2_1: step 10
7. If p2 is in l2_1, there was an earlier state (step 4) where p2 was in l1_5
8. p1 in a2: step 25
9. p1 in l2_2: step 18

So all constraints are met.

But the total steps are many. Let's count:

For p2: steps 1-14 (14 steps)
For p1: steps 15-30 (16 steps)
Total: 30 steps. But maybe some steps can be merged or optimized.

Alternatively, let's look for overlaps. For example, when moving t2 to l2_1 for p2's step 11, then later using the same truck for p1.

Also, perhaps after step 14 (p2 delivered), t2 is at l2_5. So step 15: drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (for p1's step 15).

But how to optimize.

Wait, after step 14: t2 is at l2_5, p2 is there. Then, step 15: drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 (to get t2 back to l2_1 for p1's handling).

Then steps for p1:

16. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 → but p1 is in l2_1? How did it get there?

Wait, p1 is supposed to be in l2_1 after being flown there via a1.

So integrating:

After step 21 (unload p1 from a1 at l2_1), p1 is in l2_1. Then, use t2 to move it.

But after step 14, t2 is at l2_5. So after step 14, need to drive t2 back to l2_1.

So:

15. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 (after step 14)
16. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (p1 is here from step 21)
17. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
18. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (constraint 9)
19. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
20. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (constraint 1)
21. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
22. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
23. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (constraint 8)
24. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
25. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
26. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
27. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
28. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 (goal)

But how does p1 get to l2_1?

From p1's initial position:

p1 is at l1_4. To get to l2_1:

- Use t1 to move to l1_1
- Load into a1, fly to l2_1.

So steps for p1:

15. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1 (t1 is at l1_1 after step 7)
16. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
17. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
18. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
19. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
20. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
21. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

Then proceed with steps 15-28.

So integrating all steps:

Total steps would be:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
2. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
3. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
4. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
5. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
6. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
7. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
8. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
9. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
10. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
11. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
12. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
13. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
14. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
15. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
16. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
17. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
18. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
19. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
20. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
21. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
22. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
23. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
24. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
25. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
26. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
27. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
28. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
29. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
30. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
31. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
32. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
33. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
34. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
35. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2

This is 35 steps, which is very long. There must be a shorter way.

Alternative idea: Use a2 to transport p1 earlier.

But a2 is in l2_1 initially. So fly a2 to l1_1, load p1, fly back to l2_1, unload, then use t2 to move to l2_2 and l2_5.

So steps:

For p1:

15. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
16. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (constraint 8)
17. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
18. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
19. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (assuming t2 is there)
20. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
21. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (constraint 9)
22. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
23. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (constraint 1)
24. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (again)
25. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
26. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
27. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
28. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
29. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
30. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
31. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
32. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
33. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l1_1 (no)
Wait, this is not helping.

Alternatively, after step 23 (p1 in l2_5), fly a2 to l2_5? No, because l2_5 is not an airport. So need to drive back to l2_1.

But this is getting too long. The optimal plan must have fewer steps. Let's think differently.

What if we combine the steps for p1 and p2 where possible?

For example, after flying a1 to l2_1 with p2, a1 is there. Then, use a1 to transport p1 back to l1_1.

But p1 needs to go to l2_5 first.

Alternatively, use a1 to transport p1 to l2_1 after delivering p2.

But this would require:

After step 10 (unload p2 at l2_1), a1 is at l2_1. Then, load p1 into a1, fly back to l1_1, unload, then use t1.

But how does p1 get to l2_1?

Wait, p1 is initially in l1_4. To get to l2_1, need to be transported via a1.

So:

After delivering p2 to l2_1 (step 10), a1 is at l2_1. Then:

15. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1 (empty)
16. load p1 into a1 at l1_1 (needs p1 to be there. So use t1 to bring p1 to l1_1)

Steps:

15. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
16. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
17. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
18. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
19. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
20. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
21. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 (now p1 is in l2_1)

Then, proceed to use t2 to move p1 to l2_2 and l2_5.

But t2 is at l2_1 after step 11 (drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2), then step 12-14: load p2 and drive to l2_5. So after step 14, t2 is at l2_5. So need to drive back to l2_1.

22. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
23. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
24. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
25. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (constraint 9)
26. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
27. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (constraint 1)
28. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_5 (can't, not an airport)
29. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
30. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
31. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (constraint 8)
32. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
33. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
34. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
35. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
36. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2

Still lengthy. This seems unavoidable due to the constraints.

But perhaps there's a shorter way by reusing airplanes.

Alternative plan:

For p2:

1. Drive t1 to l1_1, load p2, drive to l1_5, unload.
2. Drive back to l1_1, unload p2.
3. Load into a1, fly to l2_1, unload.
4. Use t2 to move to l2_5.

For p1:

5. Drive t1 to l1_4, load p1, drive to l1_1, unload.
6. Load into a2 (fly a2 to l1_1 first), fly to l2_1.
7. Unload, use t2 to move to l2_2 and l2_5.

But how does a2 get to l1_1? It starts in l2_1. So:

5. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
6. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (constraint 8)
7. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
8. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
9. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
10. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2, unload (constraint 9)
11. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5, unload (constraint 1)
12. fly a2 to l1_1, unload p1, then use t1 to drive to l1_2.

This approach reduces steps. Let's outline:

Steps for p2:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
2. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
3. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
4. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
5. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
6. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
7. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
8. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
9. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
10. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
11. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
12. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
13. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
14. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5

Steps for p1:

15. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
16. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
17. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
18. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
19. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
20. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (constraint 8)
21. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
22. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
23. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 (after step 14)
24. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
25. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
26. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (constraint 9)
27. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
28. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (constraint 1)
29. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
30. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (p1 is at l2_5, so can't be loaded. This step is invalid.)

Ah, here's the problem. After step 28, p1 is at l2_5. To get it back to c1, we need to move it to an airport (l2_1), load into a2, and fly.

So:

29. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
30. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
31. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
32. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
33. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
34. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
35. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
36. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
37. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2

This is getting even longer. It seems challenging to find a shorter plan while satisfying all constraints.

Perhaps the optimal plan has around 20 steps. Let me try to find a way to reuse actions for both packages.

Another observation: the constraint that p2 must be in l1_5 before l2_1 requires moving p2 to l1_5, which takes steps. This seems unavoidable.

But maybe after moving p2 to l1_5, instead of moving it back to l1_1, we can use a different truck or airplane. But in c1, only t1 is available.

Alternatively, use a different airplane to move p2 from l1_5 to l2_1. But l1_5 is not an airport, so can't load into airplane there.

So the steps for p2 are unavoidable.

For p1, the critical constraints are being in a2, l2_2, and l2_5. The most efficient way would be to load p1 into a2 at l1_1, fly to l2_1, then use t2 to move to l2_2 and l2_5.

But how to get p1 to l1_1.

Steps for p1:

1. Drive t1 to l1_4, load p1, drive to l1_1.
2. Load into a2, fly to l2_1.
3. Unload, use t2 to move to l2_2 and l2_5.
4. Fly back to l1_1, then to l1_2.

But this requires:

15. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
16. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
17. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
18. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
19. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
20. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (constraint 8)
21. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
22. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
23. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 (after p2's delivery)
24. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
25. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2 (constraint 9)
26. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
27. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2 (constraint 1)
28. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
29. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
30. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
31. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
32. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
33. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
34. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
35. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2

This is still 35 steps. I think this is the minimal possible given the constraints, but it's quite long. However, the problem states that the plan must be optimal, so perhaps there's a smarter way.

Wait, perhaps the initial steps for p2 can be combined with p1's steps. For example, after moving p2 to l1_5, can we use that truck to also move p1?

But t1 is used for p2 first, then can be used for p1.

Alternatively, after step 4 (p2 at l1_5), drive t1 back to l1_4 to pick up p1.

So:

5. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1 (after step 4)
6. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
7. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
8. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
9. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
10. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
11. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
12. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (after t2 arrives)
13. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
14. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
15. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
16. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
17. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
18. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (but p1 is at l2_5; can't load)

No, this doesn't work.

Alternatively, after p1 is in l2_5, drive t2 back to l2_1, load into a2, fly to l1_1, then use t1 to move to l1_2.

But this still requires multiple steps.

At this point, it's clear that the constraints necessitate a lengthy plan. Given the problem's complexity, the optimal plan likely requires around 30 steps. However, the user might expect a shorter plan by leveraging overlapping actions or reusing trucks/airplanes more efficiently.

Final attempt to find a shorter plan:

1. Move p2 to l1_5 (steps 1-4)
2. Move p1 to l1_1 (steps 5-8)
3. Load p1 into a2 after flying a2 to l1_1 (steps 9-10)
4. Fly a2 back to l2_1, unload p1 (steps 11-12)
5. Use t2 to move p1 to l2_2 and l2_5 (steps 13-16)
6. Fly p1 back to l1_1 via a2 (steps 17-19)
7. Move p1 to l1_2 (steps 20-21)

Meanwhile, p2 is handled in steps 22-25.

But this approach may interleave steps for p1 and p2, reducing overall steps.

But the ordering must respect dependencies. For example, p2's step to l1_5 must come before p2's step to l2_1.

This is getting too time-consuming. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with a plan that meets all the constraints, even if it's lengthy.
