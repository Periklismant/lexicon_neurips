Let's first understand the problem. Here's a summary:

- We have objects: locations (l1_1, ..., l1_5, l2_1, ..., l2_5), cities (c1, c2), packages (p1, p2), trucks (t1, t2), and airplanes (a1, a2).
- The locations are grouped into cities: l1_1 to l1_5 are in city c1, and l2_1 to l2_5 are in city c2.
- l1_1 and l2_1 are airports.
- We have actions: loadtruck, loadairplane, unloadtruck, unloadairplane, drivetruck, flyairplane.

The initial state:
- t1 is in location l1_5
- t2 is in location l2_3
- p1 is in location l2_1
- p2 is in location l2_1
- a1 is in location l1_1
- a2 is in location l2_1

The goal:
- Package p1 is in location l1_1
- Package p2 is in location l2_5

There are also several constraints:
1. At some point, p2 must be in l2_1 (already satisfied in the initial state).
2. After p2 is in l2_1, at some point, either p1 must be in l1_5 or p2 must be in l2_2.
3. At some point, p1 must be in l2_1 (already satisfied in the initial state).
4. After p1 is in l2_1, at some point, either p1 must be in l2_4 or p2 must be in l2_3.
5. At some point, p1 must be in t1.
6. At some point, p2 must be in l2_5 (this is also part of the goal).
7. Before p2 is in l2_5, p1 must be in l1_4.
8. At some point, either p1 must be in l2_3 or p1 must be in t2.
9. At some point, p1 must be in l1_4.
10. At some point, p1 must be in t2 (This seems to satisfy constraint 8).

Let's start planning. Based on all these constraints and the goal, we need to:
1. Move p1 from l2_1 to l1_1
2. Move p2 from l2_1 to l2_5
3. Ensure all constraints are met along the way.

First, let's satisfy constraint 4: after p1 is in l2_1 (which is already true in the initial state), at some point, either p1 must be in l2_4 or p2 must be in l2_3. We can choose to move p1 to l2_4 or p2 to l2_3.

Let's plan to move:
- p1 from l2_1 to l2_4, and then to l1_1
- p2 from l2_1 to l2_5

To satisfy constraint 10, p1 must at some point be in t2. And to satisfy constraint 8, p1 must at some point be in l2_3 or t2. So, we can satisfy both by ensuring p1 is in t2 at some point.

To satisfy constraint 5, p1 must at some point be in t1.

To satisfy constraint 9, p1 must at some point be in l1_4.

To satisfy constraint 7, p1 must be in l1_4 before p2 is in l2_5.

Let's outline a plan:

1. p1 starts in l2_1, p2 starts in l2_1.
2. Move p1 to l2_4 (to satisfy constraint 4).
3. Move p1 to t2 (to satisfy constraints 8 and 10).
4. Move p1 to l2_1.
5. Transport p1 from l2_1 to l1_1 via airplane.
6. Ensure that along the way, p1 is in l1_4 (to satisfy constraint 9).
7. Ensure p1 is also in t1 at some point (to satisfy constraint 5).
8. After p1 is in l1_4, move p2 to l2_5 (to satisfy constraint 7).

Wait, let's check constraint 2: after p2 is in l2_1 (already satisfied in the initial state), at some point, either p1 must be in l1_5 or p2 must be in l2_2. We can either move p1 to l1_5 or p2 to l2_2. 

Now, let's refine our plan:

1. p1 starts in l2_1, p2 starts in l2_1.
2. Load p1 in t2 (to satisfy constraints 8 and 10).
3. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_4 (moving p1 to l2_4 to satisfy constraint 4).
4. Drive t2 back to l2_1.
5. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1.
6. Load p1 in a2 (assuming a2 is an airplane at l2_1).
7. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
8. Before unloading p1, we need to ensure p1 gets to l1_4 and is in t1 at some point.
9. Load p2 in t2.
10. Ensure either p1 is in l1_5 or p2 is in l2_2 (for constraint 2).
11. Before moving p2 to l2_5, ensure p1 is in l1_4 (for constraint 7).
12. Move p2 to l2_5.

There seems to be a bit of a cycle in our constraints and it's getting complex. Let me revise more carefully:

Starting state:
- p1 is in l2_1
- p2 is in l2_1
- t1 is in l1_5
- t2 is in l2_3
- a1 is in l1_1
- a2 is in l2_1

Final goal:
- p1 is in l1_1
- p2 is in l2_5

I'll break down the problem more systematically and sequentially:

1. First, I need to move p1 to t2 (to satisfy constraint 10). But t2 is in l2_3 and p1 is in l2_1. 
   a. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1.
   b. Load p1 into t2 at l2_1. Now constraint 10 is satisfied, and p1 is in t2.

2. Drive t2 to l2_3. Now p1 is in t2 at l2_3, which satisfies constraint 8 (p1 must be in l2_3 or t2 at some point).

3. Drive t2 to l2_4. Now p1 is in t2 at l2_4, which partially satisfies constraint 4 (after p1 is in l2_1, at some point, either p1 must be in l2_4 or p2 must be in l2_3).

4. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_4. Now p1 is in l2_4.

5. I need to get p1 to l1_1 (the final goal). p1 is in l2_4, but to get to l1_1, it needs to go through an airport (l2_1 or l1_1).
   a. Drive t2 to l2_1 (the airport in city c2).
   b. Drive p1 back to l2_1 (from l2_4).
   c. Load p1 into a2 at l2_1.
   d. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.

Wait, there's a contradiction here. I can't simultaneously have p1 in l2_4 and move it with t2. I need to rethink.

1. p1 starts in l2_1. I need to move it to t2, but t2 is in l2_3. 
   a. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1.
   b. Load p1 into t2 at l2_1. Now constraint 10 is satisfied, and constraint 8 is satisfied (p1 is in t2).

2. Drive t2 to l2_4. Now constraint 4 is satisfied (after p1 is in l2_1, at some point, p1 is in l2_4).

3. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_4.

4. Now, I need to get p1 to l1_4 (constraint 9), and I need to do this before p2 is in l2_5 (constraint 7).
   a. Drive t2 to l2_1.
   b. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l2_1 through the airports.
   c. Load p1 into t1 at l2_1. Now constraint 5 is satisfied (p1 is in t1).
   d. Drive t1 from l2_1 to l1_4. Now constraint 9 is satisfied (p1 is in l1_4).

5. Now I can move p2 to l2_5 (constraint 7 has been satisfied).
   a. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2 (to satisfy constraint 2).
   b. Load p2 into t2 at l2_2.
   c. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_5.
   d. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_5. Now constraint 6 is satisfied (p2 is in l2_5), and part of the goal is achieved.

6. Finally, I need to get p1 to l1_1 (the goal).
   a. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1.
   b. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1. Now p1 is in l1_1, completing the goal.

Ok, there's still some contradictions in this plan. I need to revise carefully. Let's trace the movements for p1 and p2 independently:

For p1:
1. p1 starts in l2_1.
2. I want to load p1 into t2, which means I first need to get t2 to l2_1.
   a. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1.
   b. Load p1 into t2 at l2_1. Now constraint 10 is satisfied (p1 is in t2).
3. Drive t2 to l2_4. Now constraint 4 is satisfied (after p1 is in l2_1, at some point, p1 is in l2_4).
4. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_4.
5. Drive t2 to l2_1.
6. Wait, I need to get p1 to l1_4 (constraint 9), and I need to do this before p2 is in l2_5 (constraint 7). I should be able to use an airplane for this, but I also need to have p1 in t1 at some point (constraint 5).
   a. Load p1 into a2 at l2_1 (assuming a2 is here).
   b. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
   c. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1.
   d. Move t1 from l1_5 to l1_1.
   e. Load p1 into t1 at l1_1. Now constraint 5 is satisfied (p1 is in t1).
   f. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_4. Now constraint 9 is satisfied (p1 is in l1_4).

Wait, I think I'm making a mistake. I need to go back to the initial state and carefully read the constraints with the possible actions.

Initial state:
- p1 is in location l2_1
- p2 is in location l2_1
- t1 is in location l1_5
- t2 is in location l2_3
- a1 is in location l1_1
- a2 is in location l2_1

Goal:
- p1 is in location l1_1
- p2 is in location l2_5

For p1, I need to: get it from l2_1 to l1_1.
For p2, I need to: get it from l2_1 to l2_5.

I also need to satisfy all constraints. I'll list them again:

1. At some point, p2 must be in l2_1 (already satisfied in the initial state).
2. After p2 is in l2_1, at some point, either p1 must be in l1_5 or p2 must be in l2_2.
3. At some point, p1 must be in l2_1 (already satisfied in the initial state).
4. After p1 is in l2_1, at some point, either p1 must be in l2_4 or p2 must be in l2_3.
5. At some point, p1 must be in t1.
6. At some point, p2 must be in l2_5 (part of the goal).
7. Before p2 is in l2_5, p1 must be in l1_4.
8. At some point, either p1 must be in l2_3 or p1 must be in t2.
9. At some point, p1 must be in l1_4 (related to constraint 7).
10. At some point, p1 must be in t2 (this would satisfy constraint 8).

I see that to accomplish my goal, I'll need to use the airplane to transport p1 from city c2 to city c1, and I'll need to use trucks to move both packages within their respective cities.

For the airplane, I notice a1 is at l1_1 and a2 is at l2_1, positioning them at their respective city's airports. This will allow me to transport packages between cities.

Let's plan step-by-step:

1. First, I need to decide how to satisfy constraint 4. After p1 is in l2_1 (which is already true in the initial state), at some point, either p1 must be in l2_4 or p2 must be in l2_3. I know t2 is in l2_3 from the initial state.
   I could satisfy this constraint in a couple of ways:
   a. Move p1 to l2_4.
   b. Move p2 to l2_3.

2. I also need to satisfy constraint 10 (at some point, p1 must be in t2). Given that t2 is initially in l2_3, I need to connect p1 (in l2_1) with t2.

3. I need to satisfy constraint 8 (at some point, either p1 must be in l2_3 or p1 must be in t2). This constraint is satisfied by ensuring p1 is in t2 at some point (which I'm planning to do to satisfy constraint 10).

4. I need to satisfy constraint 5 (at some point, p1 must be in t1). Given that t1 is initially in l1_5, I need to connect p1 with t1.

5. I need to satisfy constraint 9 (at some point, p1 must be in l1_4).

6. I need to satisfy constraint 7 (before p2 is in l2_5, p1 must be in l1_4). This means I need to ensure p1 has been in l1_4 before completing the goal for p2.

7. I need to satisfy constraint 2 (after p2 is in l2_1, at some point, either p1 must be in l1_5 or p2 must be in l2_2). Since p2 is in l2_1, I need to ensure one of these happens.

Let's approach it step-by-step:

1. First, I'll satisfy constraint 10 and 8 by getting p1 into t2.
   a. Driver t2 from l2_3 to l2_1.
   b. Load p1 into t2 at l2_1.

2. Now p1 is in t2. I'll satisfy constraint 4 by taking p1 to l2_4.
   a. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4 (with p1 onboard).
   b. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_4.

3. I need to get p1 to l1_4 to satisfy constraint 9, and this needs to happen before p2 reaches l2_5 (constraint 7).
   a. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1 (the airport in city c2).
   b. Load p1 into a2 at l2_1.
   c. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1 (the airport in city c1).
   d. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1.
   e. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_1.
   f. Load p1 into t1 at l1_1. This satisfies constraint 5 (p1 is in t1).
   g. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_4. This satisfies constraint 9 (p1 is in l1_4).

4. Now I can move p2 to l2_5, as the condition that p1 must be in l1_4 before p2 is in l2_5 is met.
   a. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2. This helps satisfy constraint 2 (after p2 is in l2_1, at some point, p2 is in l2_2).
   b. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1.
   c. Load p2 into t2 at l2_1.
   d. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_5.
   e. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_5. This satisfies constraint 6 and part of the goal (p2 is in l2_5).

5. Finally, I need to get p1 to l1_1 (the goal).
   a. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1.
   b. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1. Now p1 is in l1_1, completing the goal.

Let me check for any contradictions or missed steps. Actually I think I skipped a few steps in the above.
1. I can't have p1 in l2_4 (step 2b) and simultaneously drive t2 to l2_1 (step 3a). I need to look for another plan.

Actually p2 is already in l2_1. I can first load p1 into t2, drive t2 to l2_4 with p1, unload p1 there, and then go back to get p2.
Revised Plan:

1. Driver t2 from l2_3 to l2_1.
2. Load p1 into t2 at l2_1. Now constraint 10 is satisfied (p1 is in t2), also satisfying constraint 8.
3. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4 (with p1 onboard).
4. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_4. Now constraint 4 is satisfied (after p1 is in l2_1, at some point, p1 is in l2_4).
5. Drive t2 back to l2_1.
6. Load p2 into t2 at l2_1.
7. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2 (with p2 onboard). Now constraint 2 is satisfied (after p2 is in l2_1, at some point, p2 is in l2_2).
8. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_2.
9. Drive t2 back to l2_4.
10. Load p1 into t2 at l2_4.
11. Drive t2 to l2_1.
12. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1.
13. Load p1 into a2 at l2_1.
14. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
15. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1.
16. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_1.
17. Load p1 into t1 at l1_1. Now constraint 5 is satisfied (p1 is in t1).
18. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_4. Now constraint 9 is satisfied (p1 is in l1_4), and we can now move p2 to l2_5 (to satisfy constraint 7).
19. Drive t1 back to l1_1.
20. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1. Now p1 is in l1_1, satisfying part of the goal.
21. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2.
22. Load p2 into t2 at l2_2.
23. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_5.
24. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_5. Now constraint 6 is satisfied (p2 is in l2_5), and the other part of the goal is completed.

Actually this doesn't look right. Let me reconstruct again. I need to be more careful about the locations of everything.

Initial state:
- p1 is in location l2_1
- p2 is in location l2_1
- t1 is in location l1_5
- t2 is in location l2_3
- a1 is in location l1_1
- a2 is in location l2_1

Goal:
- p1 is in location l1_1
- p2 is in location l2_5

Constraint 1: p2 must be in l2_1 at some point (already satisfied in the initial state).
Constraint 2: After p2 is in l2_1, at some point, either p1 must be in l1_5 or p2 must be in l2_2.
Constraint 3: p1 must be in l2_1 at some point (already satisfied in the initial state).
Constraint 4: After p1 is in l2_1, at some point, either p1 must be in l2_4 or p2 must be in l2_3.
Constraint 5: p1 must be in t1 at some point.
Constraint 6: p2 must be in l2_5 at some point (goal).
Constraint 7: Before p2 is in l2_5, p1 must be in l1_4.
Constraint 8: Either p1 is in l2_3 or p1 is in t2 at some point.
Constraint 9: p1 must be in l1_4 at some point.
Constraint 10: p1 must be in t2 at some point.

Let me make a more deliberate plan.

Given the initial state and the constraints, here's my plan:

1. First, I need to satisfy constraint 10 (p1 must be in t2). t2 is in l2_3, and p1 is in l2_1.
   a. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1.
   b. Load p1 into t2 at l2_1. Now constraint 10 is satisfied (p1 is in t2). This also satisfies constraint 8 (either p1 is in l2_3 or p1 is in t2).

2. After constraint 10 is satisfied, I need to satisfy constraint 4. After p1 is in l2_1 (which is already true in the initial state), at some point, either p1 must be in l2_4 or p2 must be in l2_3. I have a choice:
   a. I can drive t2 (with p1 inside) to l2_4 and unload p1 there.
   b. I can load p2 into t2, drive t2 to l2_3, and unload p2 there.
   
   I choose option (a).
   a. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4 (with p1 inside).
   b. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_4. Now constraint 4 is satisfied (after p1 is in l2_1, at some point, p1 is in l2_4).

3. For constraint 2, after p2 is in l2_1 (which is true in the initial state), at some point, either p1 must be in l1_5 or p2 must be in l2_2. I have a choice:
   a. I can move p1 to l1_5.
   b. I can move p2 to l2_2.
   
   I choose option (b) since p2 is closer to l2_2 than p1 is to l1_5.
   a. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
   b. Load p2 into t2 at l2_1.
   c. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2 (with p2 inside).
   d. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_2. Now constraint 2 is satisfied (after p2 is in l2_1, at some point, p2 is in l2_2).

4. For constraint 9, p1 must be in l1_4 at some point. But before satisfying this, I need to ensure p1 is in t1 at some point (constraint 5). I'll need to move p1 to city c1, which I can do with the airplane, and then have t1 pick it up.
   a. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_4.
   b. Load p1 into t2 at l2_4.
   c. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
   d. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1.
   e. Load p1 into a2 at l2_1.
   f. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
   g. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1.
   h. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_1.
   i. Load p1 into t1 at l1_1. Now constraint 5 is satisfied (p1 is in t1).
   j. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_4 (with p1 inside).
   k. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_4. Now constraint 9 is satisfied (p1 is in l1_4).

5. Now I can move p2 to l2_5 (constraint 7 says that before p2 is in l2_5, p1 must be in l1_4).
   a. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2.
   b. Load p2 into t2 at l2_2.
   c. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_5 (with p2 inside).
   d. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_5. Now constraint 6 is satisfied and part of the goal is achieved (p2 is in l2_5).

6. Finally, I need to move p1 to l1_1 to complete the goal.
   a. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1.
   b. Load p1 into t1 at l1_4.
   c. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1 (with p1 inside).
   d. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1. Now the other part of the goal is satisfied (p1 is in l1_1).

Let's see if there's any contradiction in the plan:

Actually, I've made a couple of mistakes in the steps.
1. In Step 4b, p1 is already in l2_4, so I can directly load it into t2.
2. In Step 6b, I specify loading p1 into t1 at l1_4, but p1 was already unloaded from t1 at l1_4 in Step 4k. So, in Step 6a, p1 is in l1_4 and t1 drives to l1_1. I should correct this.
3. In Step 6b, I also say "load p1 into t1 at l1_4" which contradicts the command in 6a where t1 is already at l1_1. I should fix this.

Updated Step 6:
   a. Load p1 into t1 at l1_4.
   b. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1 (with p1 inside).
   c. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1. Now the other part of the goal is satisfied (p1 is in l1_1).

Now, let me go through the plan step-by-step one more time to ensure there are no contradictions or missed steps:

1. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1.
2. Load p1 into t2 at l2_1. (Constraint 10: p1 must be in t2. Constraint 8: p1 must be in t2 or l2_3.)
3. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4 (with p1 inside).
4. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_4. (Constraint 4: After p1 is in l2_1, p1 must be in l2_4 or p2 must be in l2_3.)
5. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
6. Load p2 into t2 at l2_1.
7. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2 (with p2 inside).
8. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_2. (Constraint 2: After p2 is in l2_1, p1 must be in l1_5 or p2 must be in l2_2.)
9. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_4.
10. Load p1 into t2 at l2_4.
11. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
12. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1.
13. Load p1 into a2 at l2_1.
14. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
15. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1.
16. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_1.
17. Load p1 into t1 at l1_1. (Constraint 5: p1 must be in t1.)
18. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_4 (with p1 inside).
19. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_4. (Constraint 9: p1 must be in l1_4. Also, Constraint 7: Before p2 is in l2_5, p1 must be in l1_4.)
20. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2.
21. Load p2 into t2 at l2_2.
22. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_5 (with p2 inside).
23. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_5. (Constraint 6: p2 must be in l2_5. Also, goal: p2 is in l2_5.)
24. Load p1 into t1 at l1_4.
25. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1 (with p1 inside).
26. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1. (Goal: p1 is in l1_1.)

This plan satisfies all the constraints and the goal.

But wait, step 20 is also contradictory. It says "Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2", but t2 is in l2_1, not l2_4. I need to revisit step 20 onward.

Updated sequence from step 20:
20. Load p2 into t2 at l2_2.
21. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_5 (with p2 inside).
22. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_5. (Constraint 6: p2 must be in l2_5. Also, goal: p2 is in l2_5.)
23. Load p1 into t1 at l1_4.
24. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1 (with p1 inside).
25. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1. (Goal: p1 is in l1_1.)

But, actually, that's still contradictory. Let me reread the previous step... in step 19, p1 is unloaded from t1 at l1_4. In step 8, p2 is unloaded from t2 at l2_2. So I need to drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2 FIRST. 

Let me go back to the beginning of the planning and re-trace my steps carefully.

Initial state:
- p1 is in location l2_1
- p2 is in location l2_1
- t1 is in location l1_5
- t2 is in location l2_3
- a1 is in location l1_1
- a2 is in location l2_1

Goal:
- p1 is in location l1_1
- p2 is in location l2_5

Constraint 1: p2 must be in l2_1 (already satisfied in the initial state).
Constraint 2: After p2 is in l2_1, at some point, either p1 must be in l1_5 or p2 must be in l2_2.
Constraint 3: p1 must be in l2_1 (already satisfied in the initial state).
Constraint 4: After p1 is in l2_1, at some point, either p1 must be in l2_4 or p2 must be in l2_3.
Constraint 5: p1 must be in t1.
Constraint 6: p2 must be in l2_5 (goal).
Constraint 7: Before p2 is in l2_5, p1 must be in l1_4.
Constraint 8: Either p1 is in l2_3 or p1 is in t2.
Constraint 9: p1 must be in l1_4.
Constraint 10: p1 must be in t2.

Here's the plan:

1. First, I'll satisfy constraint 10 (p1 must be in t2). t2 is in l2_3, and p1 is in l2_1.
   a. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1.
   b. Load p1 into t2 at l2_1. Constraint 10: p1 is in t2, Constraint 8: Either p1 is in l2_3 or p1 is in t2.

2. For constraint 4 (after p1 is in l2_1, at some point, p1 must be in l2_4 or p2 must be in l2_3), I choose to have p1 in l2_4.
   a. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4 (with p1 inside).
   b. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_4. Constraint 4: After p1 is in l2_1, at some point, p1 is in l2_4.

3. Now for constraint 2 (after p2 is in l2_1, at some point, p1 must be in l1_5 or p2 must be in l2_2), I choose to have p2 in l2_2.
   a. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
   b. Load p2 into t2 at l2_1.
   c. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2 (with p2 inside).
   d. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_2. Constraint 2: After p2 is in l2_1, at some point, p2 is in l2_2.

4. Now for constraint 9 (p1 must be in l1_4), and constraint 5 (p1 must be in t1).
   a. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_4.
   b. Load p1 into t2 at l2_4.
   c. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1 (with p1 inside).
   d. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1.
   e. Load p1 into a2 at l2_1.
   f. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1 (with p1 inside).
   g. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1.
   h. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_1.
   i. Load p1 into t1 at l1_1. Constraint 5: p1 is in t1.
   j. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_4 (with p1 inside).
   k. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_4. Constraint 9: p1 is in l1_4.

5. Now I can move p2 to l2_5 (because of constraint 7, before p2 is in l2_5, p1 must be in l1_4).
   a. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2.
   b. Load p2 into t2 at l2_2.
   c. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_5 (with p2 inside).
   d. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_5. Constraint 6: p2 is in l2_5, Goal: p2 is in l2_5.

6. Finally, I need to move p1 to l1_1 to complete the goal.
   a. Load p1 into t1 at l1_4.
   b. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1 (with p1 inside).
   c. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1. Goal: p1 is in l1_1.

Let's check for any contradictions:

Step 5a: Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2. I see that in the previous step (4d), t2 is at l2_1. So, this is consistent.

Alright, I believe this plan is contradiction-free and satisfies all constraints. Let's format the list of actions:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
3. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
5. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
6. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
7. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
8. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
9. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2
10. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
11. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
12. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
13. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
14. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
15. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
16. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
17. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
18. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
19. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
20. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
21. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
22. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
23. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
24. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
25. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
26. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

This plan, in the specified format, should achieve the goal while satisfying all the constraints.

Actually I need to check one more thing about this plan: the order of steps 5 and 6. In step 5a, we're handling constraint 7 which says "Before p2 is in l2_5, p1 must be in l1_4." In step 4k, we've already established that p1 is in l1_4. So step 5 comes after step 4, as mentioned in the plan, then everything is consistent.

Hmm, I just noticed the unloadairplane is actually written as "loadairplane p ap l" rather than "unloadairplane p ap l". So the action list should be:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
3. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
5. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
6. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
7. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
8. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
9. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2
10. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
11. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
12. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
13. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
14. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
15. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
16. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
17. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
18. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
19. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
20. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
21. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
22. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
23. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
24. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
25. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
26. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

Actually this doesn't look right. Let me recheck the available actions given in the problem statement.

Actually, the action "unloadairplane p ap l" is defined in the problem statement, but there's a typo in how it's described. It says "loadairplane p ap l" twice, once for loading and once for unloading. But the description clearly indicates that one is for loading and one is for unloading. So, I should be using "unloadairplane" for unloading, not "loadairplane" for a second time.

So the action list should be:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
3. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
5. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
6. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
7. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
8. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
9. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2
10. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
11. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
12. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
13. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
14. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
15. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
16. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
17. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
18. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
19. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
20. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
21. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
22. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
23. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
24. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
25. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
26. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

Wait, there's another error in the problem description. It lists the initial location of Package t1 as l1_5 and Package t2 as l2_3.

"Package t1 is in location l1_5"
"Package t2 is in location l2_3"

This is incorrect. t1 and t2 are trucks, not packages. The correct interpretation should be:

"Truck t1 is in location l1_5"
"Truck t2 is in location l2_3"

So, my plan is based on this interpretation. Truck t1 is in location l1_5, and Truck t2 is in location l2_3. Everything else is as described in the original state.

Actually, let me re-evaluate the problem statement and my current plan. And check whether there are any missing pieces or inconsistencies.

Initial state:
- p1 is in location l2_1
- p2 is in location l2_1
- t1 is in location l1_5
- t2 is in location l2_3
- a1 is in location l1_1
- a2 is in location l2_1

Goal:
- p1 is in location l1_1
- p2 is in location l2_5

Constraints:
1. p2 must be in l2_1 (already satisfied in the initial state).
2. After p2 is in l2_1, either p1 must be in l1_5 or p2 must be in l2_2.
3. p1 must be in l2_1 (already satisfied in the initial state).
4. After p1 is in l2_1, either p1 must be in l2_4 or p2 must be in l2_3.
5. p1 must be in t1 at some point.
6. p2 must be in l2_5 (part of the goal).
7. Before p2 is in l2_5, p1 must be in l1_4.
8. Either p1 is in l2_3 or p1 is in t2 at some point.
9. p1 must be in l1_4 at some point.
10. p1 must be in t2 at some point.

My current plan satisfies all the constraints:

Constraint 1 & 3: Already satisfied in the initial state.
Constraint 2: p2 goes to l2_2 in steps 6-8.
Constraint 4: p1 goes to l2_4 in steps 2-4.
Constraint 5: p1 is in t1 in steps 17-19 and 24-26.
Constraint 6: p2 is in l2_5 in step 23.
Constraint 7: p1 is in l1_4 in step 19 and p2 goes to l2_5 in steps 21-23.
Constraint 8: p1 is in t2 in steps 2-3 and 10-11.
Constraint 9: p1 is in l1_4 in step 19.
Constraint 10: p1 is in t2 in steps 2-3 and 10-11.

So, my plan satisfies all the constraints. Are there any other aspects I need to check?

Let's double-check each action in my plan to make sure they satisfy all preconditions and their effects are consistent:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2: t2 is in l2_3 in the initial state, l2_3 and l2_1 are in city c2. Preconditions satisfied.
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1: p1 and t2 are both in l2_1 after step 1. Preconditions satisfied.
3. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2: t2 is in l2_1 after step 2, l2_1 and l2_4 are in city c2. Preconditions satisfied.
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4: t2 is in l2_4 after step 3, p1 is in t2. Preconditions satisfied.
5. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2: t2 is in l2_4 after step 4, l2_4 and l2_1 are in city c2. Preconditions satisfied.
6. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1: p2 is in l2_1 in the initial state, t2 is in l2_1 after step 5. Preconditions satisfied.
7. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2: t2 is in l2_1 after step 6, l2_1 and l2_2 are in city c2. Preconditions satisfied.
8. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2: t2 is in l2_2 after step 7, p2 is in t2. Preconditions satisfied.
9. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2: t2 is in l2_2 after step 8, l2_2 and l2_4 are in city c2. Preconditions satisfied.
10. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4: p1 is in l2_4 after step 4, t2 is in l2_4 after step 9. Preconditions satisfied.
11. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2: t2 is in l2_4 after step 10, l2_4 and l2_1 are in city c2. Preconditions satisfied.
12. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1: t2 is in l2_1 after step 11, p1 is in t2. Preconditions satisfied.
13. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1: p1 is in l2_1 after step 12, a2 is in l2_1 in the initial state. Preconditions satisfied.
14. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1: a2 is in l2_1 after step 13. Preconditions satisfied.
15. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1: a2 is in l1_1 after step 14, p1 is in a2. Preconditions satisfied.
16. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1: t1 is in l1_5 in the initial state, l1_5 and l1_1 are in city c1. Preconditions satisfied.
17. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1: p1 is in l1_1 after step 15, t1 is in l1_1 after step 16. Preconditions satisfied.
18. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1: t1 is in l1_1 after step 17, l1_1 and l1_4 are in city c1. Preconditions satisfied.
19. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4: t1 is in l1_4 after step 18, p1 is in t1. Preconditions satisfied.
20. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2: t2 is in l2_1 after step 12, l2_1 and l2_2 are in city c2. Preconditions satisfied.
21. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2: p2 is in l2_2 after step 8, t2 is in l2_2 after step 20. Preconditions satisfied.
22. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2: t2 is in l2_2 after step 21, l2_2 and l2_5 are in city c2. Preconditions satisfied.
23. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5: t2 is in l2_5 after step 22, p2 is in t2. Preconditions satisfied.
24. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4: p1 is in l1_4 after step 19, t1 is in l1_4 after step 19. Preconditions satisfied.
25. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1: t1 is in l1_4 after step 24, l1_4 and l1_1 are in city c1. Preconditions satisfied.
26. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1: t1 is in l1_1 after step 25, p1 is in t1. Preconditions satisfied.

All steps seem to satisfy their respective preconditions based on the previous states, and their effects are applied correctly.

Let's double check step 20-23: 
After step 12, p1 is in l2_1 and t2 is also there. Steps 13-19 involve moving p1, but not t2. So, in step 20, t2 is still in l2_1, which means we can execute "drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2". 

In step 8, we unload p2 at l2_2, and p2 remains there. So, in step 21, p2 is in l2_2, and after step 20, t2 is also in l2_2. Thus, we can execute "loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2".

I still seem to have a contradiction. Step 20 assumes t2 is in l2_1, but I need to double-check where t2 is before step 20. After step 19, the location of t2 should still be l2_1, from after step 11 drives it to l2_1 and it doesn't move in steps 12-19, since they involve different vehicles. So, step 20 is valid.

Let's finalize the plan:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
3. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
5. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
6. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
7. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
8. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
9. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2
10. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
11. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
12. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
13. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
14. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
15. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
16. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
17. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
18. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
19. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
20. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
21. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
22. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
23. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
24. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
25. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
26. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

This plan satisfies all the constraints and achieves the goal, and all steps satisfy their respective preconditions and their effects are consistent. The plan is valid.
