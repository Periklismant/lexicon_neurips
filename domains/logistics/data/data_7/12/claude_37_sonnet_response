Let me analyze the problem statement and look for a solution.

First, I'll clarify my understanding of the initial state:
- There are 2 cities (c1, c2), each with 5 locations including one airport
- City c1 has locations l1_1 (airport), l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5
- City c2 has locations l2_1 (airport), l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5
- Truck t1 is in location l1_4 (city c1)
- Truck t2 is in location l2_4 (city c2)
- Airplane a1 is in airport l1_1 (city c1)
- Airplane a2 is in airport l2_1 (city c2)
- Package p1 is in location l1_2 (city c1)
- Package p2 is in location l2_5 (city c2)

The goal is:
- Package p1 is in location l1_3
- Package p2 is in location l2_5

Constraints:
1. At some point, p2 must be in location l2_3 or in airplane a2
2. At some point, p2 must be in truck t1
3. At some point, p1 must be in truck t2 AND p2 must be in airplane a2
4. At some point, p2 must be in location l2_1
5. At some point, p1 must be in location l1_2 (this is already satisfied in the initial state)
6. If p1 is in location l1_2, then p2 must be in location l2_4 at that point or after
7. At some point, p1 must be in location l1_4
8. At some point, p2 must be in airplane a1

Let's trace a possible plan:

Initial state:
- p1 is in l1_2
- p2 is in l2_5
- t1 is in l1_4
- t2 is in l2_4
- a1 is in l1_1
- a2 is in l2_1

Wait, there's a problem with the definition. It says:
"Package t1 is in location l1_4"
"Package t2 is in location l2_4"
"Package a1 is in location l1_1"
"Package a2 is in location l2_1"

But t1 and t2 should be trucks, and a1 and a2 should be airplanes, not packages. Let me assume this is a typo and continue with:

- Truck t1 is in location l1_4
- Truck t2 is in location l2_4
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1
- Package p1 is in location l1_2
- Package p2 is in location l2_5

Let's think about satisfying the constraints:

Constraint 5 (p1 in l1_2) is already satisfied in the initial state.
Constraint 6 (if p1 in l1_2, then p2 in l2_4 at that point or later) is not satisfied initially, since p2 is in l2_5.

Let's create a plan to satisfy the constraints:

1. First, we need to move p2 to l2_4 since p1 is in l1_2 (to satisfy constraint 6)
   - Drive truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_5
   - Load p2 onto t2 at l2_5
   - Drive t2 to l2_4
   - Unload p2 at l2_4

2. Constraint 3 requires p1 in t2 and p2 in a2 simultaneously
   - Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1 (where a2 is)
   - Load p2 onto a2 at l2_1 (also satisfies constraint 4 - p2 in l2_1)
   - Fly a2 to l1_1
   - Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_2
   - Load p1 onto t1 at l1_2
   - Drive t1 to l1_1
   - Transfer p1 to a2 (unload from t1, load to a2)
   - Fly a2 back to l2_1
   - Transfer p1 to t2 (unload from a2, load to t2)
   
3. Constraint 2 requires p2 in t1
   - Transfer p2 from a2 to t1 (unload from a2, load to t1)
   
4. Constraint 1 requires p2 in l2_3 or in a2
   - Fly a2 to l2_1
   - Drive t1 to l2_1
   - Transfer p2 back to a2 (unload from t1, load to a2)
   
5. Constraint 8 requires p2 in a1
   - Fly a2 to l1_1
   - Transfer p2 from a2 to a1 (unload from a2, load to a1)

6. Constraint 7 requires p1 in l1_4
   - Drive t2 to l2_1
   - Transfer p1 from t2 to a2 (unload from t2, load to a2)
   - Fly a2 to l1_1
   - Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1
   - Drive t1 from l2_1 to l1_1
   - Load p1 onto t1 at l1_1
   - Drive t1 to l1_4
   - Unload p1 at l1_4

7. Final goal: p1 in l1_3 and p2 in l2_5
   - Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_3
   - Load p1 onto t1 at l1_4
   - Drive t1 to l1_3
   - Unload p1 at l1_3
   - Fly a1 to l2_1
   - Unload p2 from a1 at l2_1
   - Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_5
   - Load p2 onto t2 at l2_1
   - Drive t2 to l2_5
   - Unload p2 at l2_5

Wait, there are several inconsistencies in the above plan. Let me rethink this more carefully.

I need to consider the constraints more systematically and ensure the plan is valid at each step.

Let me take a more structured approach by first identifying the constraints that need to be satisfied, and then working out a plan that respects those constraints.

Initial state:
- p1 is in l1_2
- p2 is in l2_5
- t1 is in l1_4
- t2 is in l2_4
- a1 is in l1_1
- a2 is in l2_1

Goal:
- p1 is in l1_3
- p2 is in l2_5

Constraints:
1. At some point, p2 must be in l2_3 or in a2
2. At some point, p2 must be in t1
3. At some point, p1 must be in t2 AND p2 must be in a2
4. At some point, p2 must be in l2_1
5. At some point, p1 must be in l1_2 (satisfied in initial state)
6. After p1 is in l1_2, p2 must be in l2_4 at that point or later
7. At some point, p1 must be in l1_4
8. At some point, p2 must be in a1

Let's create a step-by-step plan:

1. First, we need to move p2 to l2_4 as per constraint 6, as p1 is initially in l1_2:
   - drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2
   - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
   - drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2
   - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

2. Now, to satisfy constraint 1, we can move p2 to l2_3:
   - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
   - drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2
   - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3

3. To satisfy constraint 4, move p2 to l2_1:
   - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
   - drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
   - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

4. To satisfy constraint 8, move p2 to a1:
   - loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
   - flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
   - unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
   - loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

5. To satisfy constraint 2, move p2 to t1:
   - flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
   - unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
   - drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
   - flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
   - loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
   - unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
   
   Actually, let me restart this part. We need to get p2 to where t1 is:
   
   - unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (p2 is now in l1_1)
   - drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 (t1 is now in l1_1)
   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (p2 is now in t1, satisfying constraint 2)

6. To satisfy constraint 3, we need p1 in t2 and p2 in a2 simultaneously:
   - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (p2 is back in l1_1)
   - loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (p2 is now in a2)
   - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
   - drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
   - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
   - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
   - drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
   - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
   - flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
   - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (p1 is now in t2, while p2 is in a2, satisfying constraint 3)

Actually, I think I'm making this more complex than necessary. Let me rethink the plan to ensure each constraint is satisfied efficiently.

Initial state:
- p1 is in l1_2
- p2 is in l2_5
- t1 is in l1_4
- t2 is in l2_4
- a1 is in l1_1
- a2 is in l2_1

Goal:
- p1 is in l1_3
- p2 is in l2_5

Let's create a cleaner plan:

1. First, constraint 6 requires that after p1 is in l1_2 (which is initially the case), p2 must be in l2_4. Let's make that happen:
   - drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2
   - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
   - drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2
   - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

2. Constraint 1 requires p2 to be in l2_3 or in a2 at some point. Let's move it to l2_3:
   - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
   - drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2
   - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3

3. Constraint 4 requires p2 to be in l2_1 at some point:
   - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
   - drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
   - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

4. Constraint 8 requires p2 to be in a1 at some point:
   - loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
   - flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
   - unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
   - loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
   - unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

5. Constraint 2 requires p2 to be in t1 at some point:
   - drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
   - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

6. Constraint 3 requires p1 to be in t2 and p2 to be in a2 simultaneously:
   - loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (p2 is now in a2)
   - flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
   - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
   - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
   - drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
   - flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
   - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
   - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (This doesn't work because t2 is not at l1_1)

Wait, there's a mistake in my plan. Let me reconsider constraint 3 more carefully.

To satisfy constraint 3, we need p1 in t2 and p2 in a2 simultaneously. This means we need to coordinate the movements of these objects.

Let me rethink the steps:
1. Get p1 to where t2 is (or vice versa)
2. Get p2 to where a2 is (or vice versa)
3. Ensure these happen simultaneously

Let's revise the plan:

1. First, handle constraint 6 (after p1 is in l1_2, p2 must be in l2_4):
   - drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2
   - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
   - drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2
   - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

2. For constraint 1 (p2 in l2_3 or in a2), move p2 to l2_3:
   - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
   - drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2
   - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3

3. For constraint 4 (p2 in l2_1), move p2 to l2_1:
   - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
   - drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
   - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

4. For constraint 3 (p1 in t2 and p2 in a2 simultaneously):
   - loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (p2 is now in a2)
   - flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
   - drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1
   - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
   - drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
   - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
   - flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1 (a2 with p2 is now at l2_1)
   - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (p1 is now in t2, while p2 is in a2, satisfying constraint 3)

5. For constraint 8 (p2 in a1), we need to transfer p2 from a2 to a1:
   - unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
   - flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
   - loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
   - flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
   - unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

6. For constraint 2 (p2 in t1), we need to get p2 and t1 to the same location:
   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
   - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

7. For constraint 7 (p1 in l1_4), move p1 from t2 to l1_4:
   - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
   - loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
   - flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
   - unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
   - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
   - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
   - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

8. Finally, for the goal (p1 in l1_3 and p2 in l2_5):
   - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
   - drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1
   - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
   - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
   - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
   - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5

Ok, now let me review and refine this plan to ensure there are no inconsistencies:

1. Handle constraint 6 (after p1 is in l1_2, p2 must be in l2_4):
   - drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2
   - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
   - drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2
   - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

2. For constraint 1 (p2 in l2_3 or in a2), move p2 to l2_3:
   - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
   - drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2
   - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3

3. For constraint 4 (p2 in l2_1), move p2 to l2_1:
   - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
   - drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
   - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

4. For constraint 3 (p1 in t2 and p2 in a2 simultaneously):
   - loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (p2 is now in a2)
   - drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1
   - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
   - drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
   - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
   - flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
   - loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
   - flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1 (a2 with p1 and p2 is now at l2_1)
   - unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
   - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (p1 is now in t2, while p2 is in a2, satisfying constraint 3)

5. For constraint 8 (p2 in a1), we need to transfer p2 from a2 to a1:
   - unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
   - flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
   - loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

6. For constraint 2 (p2 in t1), we need to get p2 and t1 to the same location:
   - unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
   - flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
   - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l2_1 c1 (This is wrong, trucks can only drive within a city)

This is a problem. Truck t1 is in city c1, but p2 needs to be loaded into t1, and p2 is currently in city c2. I need to transport p2 to city c1 using an airplane.

Let me restart the plan:

1. Handle constraint 6 (after p1 is in l1_2, p2 must be in l2_4):
   - drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2
   - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
   - drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2
   - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

2. For constraint 1 (p2 in l2_3 or in a2), move p2 to l2_3:
   - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
   - drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2
   - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3

3. For constraint 4 (p2 in l2_1), move p2 to l2_1:
   - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
   - drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
   - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

4. For constraint 8 (p2 in a1), move p2 to a1:
   - loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
   - flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
   - unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
   - loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

5. For constraint 2 (p2 in t1), move t1 to where p2 is:
   - drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
   - unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

6. For constraint 3 (p1 in t2 and p2 in a2 simultaneously):
   - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
   - loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
   - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
   - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
   - flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
   - drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
   - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
   - loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
   - flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
   - unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
   - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (p1 is now in t2, while p2 is in a2, satisfying constraint 3)

7. For constraint 7 (p1 in l1_4), move p1 to l1_4:
   - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
   - loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
   - flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
   - unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
   - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
   - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
   - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
   - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

8. For the final goal (p1 in l1_3 and p2 in l2_5):
   - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
   - drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1
   - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
   - flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
   - unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
   - loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
   - flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
   - unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
   - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
   - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
   - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5

Let me check for inconsistencies again. I'm noting that I'm assuming packages can be on airplanes, trucks, or at a location but not in more than one of these at a time.

Let me review the plan once more:

1. Handle constraint 6 (after p1 is in l1_2, p2 must be in l2_4):
   - drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2
   - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
   - drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2
   - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

2. For constraint 1 (p2 in l2_3 or in a2), move p2 to l2_3:
   - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
   - drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2
   - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3

3. For constraint 4 (p2 in l2_1), move p2 to l2_1:
   - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
   - drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
   - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

4. For constraint 8 (p2 in a1), move p2 to a1:
   - loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
   - flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
   - unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
   - loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

5. For constraint 2 (p2 in t1), move t1 to where p2 is:
   - unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
   - drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

6. For constraint 3 (p1 in t2 and p2 in a2 simultaneously):
   - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
   - loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
   - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
   - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
   - flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
   - drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
   - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
   - loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
   - flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
   - unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
   - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

7. For constraint 7 (p1 in l1_4), move p1 to l1_4:
   - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
   - loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
   - flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
   - unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
   - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
   - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
   - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

8. For the final goal (p1 in l1_3 and p2 in l2_5):
   - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
   - drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1
   - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
   - flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
   - unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
   - loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
   - flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
   - unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
   - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
   - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
   - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5

Wait, I need to fix an issue in step 6. At the end of step 5, p2 is in t1, not in l1_1. So the first action in step 6 should be to unload p2 from t1.

Also, when I review the plan, I notice that in step 6, I'm not actually satisfying constraint 3. At the end of step 6, p1 is in t2, but p2 is not in a2 as required by constraint 3. Let me fix this.

Let me revise the plan:

1. Handle constraint 6 (after p1 is in l1_2, p2 must be in l2_4):
   - drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2
   - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
   - drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2
   - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

2. For constraint 1 (p2 in l2_3 or in a2), move p2 to l2_3:
   - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
   - drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2
   - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3

3. For constraint 4 (p2 in l2_1), move p2 to l2_1:
   - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
   - drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
   - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

4. For constraint 8 (p2 in a1), move p2 to a1:
   - loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
   - flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
   - unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
   - loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

5. For constraint 2 (p2 in t1), move t1 to where p2 is:
   - unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
   - drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

6. For constraint 3 (p1 in t2 and p2 in a2 simultaneously):
   - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
   - loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
   - flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
   - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
   - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
   - drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
   - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
   - loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
   - flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
   - unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
   - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (p1 is now in t2, while p2 is in a2, satisfying constraint 3)

7. For constraint 7 (p1 in l1_4), move p1 to l1_4:
   - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
   - loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
   - flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
   - unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
   - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
   - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
   - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

8. For the final goal (p1 in l1_3 and p2 in l2_5):
   - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
   - drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1
   - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
   - unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
   - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
   - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
   - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5

Let me review and make sure I've addressed all constraints:
- Constraint 1: p2 is in l2_3 or in a2. Satisfied at the end of step 2 (p2 is in l2_3) and at the end of step 6 (p2 is in a2).
- Constraint 2: p2 is in t1. Satisfied at the end of step 5.
- Constraint 3: p1 is in t2 and p2 is in a2 simultaneously. Satisfied at the end of step 6.
- Constraint 4: p2 is in l2_1. Satisfied at the end of step 3.
- Constraint 5: p1 is in l1_2. Satisfied in the initial state.
- Constraint 6: After p1 is in l1_2, p2 must be in l2_4. Satisfied at the end of step 1.
- Constraint 7: p1 is in l1_4. Satisfied at the end of step 7.
- Constraint 8: p2 is in a1. Satisfied at the end of step 4.

The final goal (p1 in l1_3 and p2 in l2_5) is satisfied at the end of step 8.

Wait, there's a problem at the end of step 3 when satisfying constraint 3. I've got p1 in t2, but p2 is not in a2. Let me fix this:

6. For constraint 3 (p1 in t2 and p2 in a2 simultaneously):
   - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
   - loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
   - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
   - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
   - drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
   - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
   - loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
   - flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
   - unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
   - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (p1 is now in t2, but we need to ensure p2 is still in a2)
   - flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1 (Now p1 is in t2 and p2 is in a2, satisfying constraint 3)

Let me finalize the plan:

1. Handle constraint 6 (after p1 is in l1_2, p2 must be in l2_4):
   - drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2
   - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
   - drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2
   - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

2. For constraint 1 (p2 in l2_3 or in a2), move p2 to l2_3:
   - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
   - drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2
   - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3

3. For constraint 4 (p2 in l2_1), move p2 to l2_1:
   - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
   - drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
   - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

4. For constraint 8 (p2 in a1), move p2 to a1:
   - loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
   - flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
   - unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
   - loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

5. For constraint 2 (p2 in t1), move t1 to where p2 is:
   - unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
   - drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

6. For constraint 3 (p1 in t2 and p2 in a2 simultaneously):
   - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
   - loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
   - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
   - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
   - drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
   - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
   - loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
   - flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
   - unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
   - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (p1 is now in t2)
   - flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1 (Now p1 is in t2 and p2 is in a2, satisfying constraint 3)

7. For constraint 7 (p1 in l1_4), move p1 to l1_4:
   - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
   - loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
   - flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
   - unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
   - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
   - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
   - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

8. For the final goal (p1 in l1_3 and p2 in l2_5):
   - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
   - drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1
   - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
   - unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
   - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
   - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
   - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5

Let's now consolidate the complete plan:

```
drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
```

Actually I realize I forgot the action is loadAIRPLANE (not loadairplane). Let me fix that:

```
drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
```

Actually based on the problem statement, we have "loadAIRPLANE" and "loadairplane" as action names. I'm confused about the capitalization here, but let me assume they're the same (probably just a typo in the problem statement).

For correctness, let me use the exact action names provided:
- loadtruck
- loadairplane
- unloadtruck
- unloadairplane
- drivetruck
- flyairplane

Final plan:
```
drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
```

This is the plan. Let me review it one more time to check for any issues.

Actually, I see that at some point we have actions like:
```
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
```

immediately followed by
```
unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
```

This is unnecessary. Let me optimize the plan a bit by removing these redundant sequences. Also, I'm going to check the whole plan for any other unnecessary actions.

Optimized plan:
```
drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
```

Actually, I realized I'm still having redundant sequences. For example there's a sequence where I unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 and then immediately loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1, only to flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1 and unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1. This could be simplified. 

However, since we have various constraints to satisfy, we need to ensure that the package has actually been in the specified configurations, even if those are just intermediate steps.

Let me check if all the constraints are actually satisfied in this plan:

- Constraint 1: p2 in l2_3 or in a2 - Satisfied (p2 is in l2_3 after unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3)
- Constraint 2: p2 in t1 - Satisfied (p2 is in t1 after loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1)
- Constraint 3: p1 in t2 and p2 in a2 simultaneously - Satisfied (p1 is in t2 after loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1, and p2 is in a2 after flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1)
- Constraint 4: p2 in l2_1 - Satisfied (p2 is in l2_1 after unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1)
- Constraint 5: p1 in l1_2 - Satisfied (p1 is in l1_2 in the initial state)
- Constraint 6: After p1 is in l1_2, p2 must be in l2_4 at that point or later - Satisfied (p2 is in l2_4 after unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4)
- Constraint 7: p1 in l1_4 - Satisfied (p1 is in l1_4 after unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4)
- Constraint 8: p2 in a1 - Satisfied (p2 is in a1 after loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1)

Now for the final goal:
- p1 is in l1_3 - Satisfied (p1 is in l1_3 after unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3)
- p2 is in l2_5 - Satisfied (p2 is in l2_5 after unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5)

Great, all the constraints and the goal are satisfied.
