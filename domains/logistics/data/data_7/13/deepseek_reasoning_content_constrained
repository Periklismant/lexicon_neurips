Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. Hmm, the goal is to get p1 to l2_4 and p2 to stay in l1_4, but there are a bunch of constraints. Let's start by understanding the initial state and the constraints.

First, the initial state: p1 and p2 are both in l1_4. Trucks t1 is in l1_4, t2 in l2_2. Airplanes a1 is in l1_1 (which is an airport in c1), a2 in l2_1 (airport in c2). The cities c1 and c2 each have their locations. 

The constraints are a bit tricky. Let's list them out:

1. At some point, p1 must be in l2_1. But before that state, p2 must have been in l1_2.
2. p2 must be in a2 at some point.
3. p1 must be in l1_1 at some point.
4. Whenever p1 is in l1_1, then either p2 is in l1_1 or l2_5 at that state or later.
5. p2 must be in l2_5 at some point.
6. At least once, either p2 is in t2 or p1 is in l1_2.
7. p1 must be in l2_3 and l2_5 each at least once.

The goal is p1 in l2_4 and p2 in l1_4. Wait, but p2 is already in l1_4 initially. So maybe we need to move it out and back? Because the problem says "bring about the goal", which might mean that p2 might have been moved elsewhere but must end up back. But according to the initial state, p2 is already in l1_4. So maybe that's a mistake, but perhaps the problem requires ensuring that p2 remains there despite possible movements. Wait, but maybe the initial state has p2 in l1_4, but during the plan, it might be moved and then returned. Let me check the original problem again.

Looking back: The original state says "Package p2 is in location l1_4". The goal requires "Package p2 is in location l1_4". So p2 must stay there. Wait, but that's already true. So maybe the constraints require moving p2 but bringing it back. Hmm, but some constraints require p2 to be in a2, l2_5, etc. So p2 must be moved around but eventually returned to l1_4. That complicates things.

So, the main challenge is moving p1 to l2_4 while handling all the constraints, and moving p2 out and back.

Let me outline the steps needed for p1:

To get p1 from l1_4 to l2_4, which is in c2. Since airplanes can move between airports. So possible steps: use a truck to move p1 from l1_4 to l1_1 (the airport), load into a plane, fly to l2_1 (airport in c2), unload, then use a truck in c2 to move it to l2_4. But wait, l2_4 is in c2. So t2 is a truck in l2_2 initially. So maybe drive t2 to l2_1, load p1 into t2, drive to l2_4.

But there are constraints that require p1 to be in l2_1, l2_3, l2_5. So how to satisfy those?

Let's see the constraints related to p1:

- Must be in l2_1 (which is the airport in c2). So that's part of the transportation path.

- Must be in l1_1 (airport in c1). So during the plan, p1 needs to be in l1_1. How? That's the starting airport. So perhaps when moving p1 via airplane, it's loaded into a1 at l1_1, but wait, initially a1 is in l1_1. Wait, the initial state says "Package a1 is in location l1_1", but wait, a1 is an airplane. So the initial state is that airplane a1 is at l1_1. Similarly, a2 is at l2_1.

So, to move p1 via a1, we need to get p1 to l1_1 first. Since p1 starts in l1_4, which is in c1. So use truck t1 (which is in l1_4) to drive p1 to l1_1. Wait, but the initial state says "Package t1 is in location l1_4". Wait, no, the original state says "Package t1 is in location l1_4". Wait, that's confusing. Wait, the objects are t1 and t2 as trucks. So "Package t1 is in location l1_4" must be a typo. Wait, looking back at the problem statement's original state:

"The original state of the world is the following:

...

Package t1 is in location l1_4

Package t2 is in location l2_2

Package p1 is in location l1_4

Package p2 is in location l1_4

Package a1 is in location l1_1

Package a2 is in location l2_1"

Wait, but t1 and t2 are trucks, not packages. So this must be a mistake. Maybe it's a typo, and it should be "Truck t1 is in location l1_4", etc. Because otherwise, the problem is impossible. So assuming that the original state entries for t1, t2, a1, a2 are their locations. So correcting that:

Truck t1 is in l1_4.

Truck t2 is in l2_2.

Airplane a1 is in l1_1.

Airplane a2 is in l2_1.

So that makes sense.

So, p1 is in l1_4 with truck t1. To move p1 to l1_1 (airport), we can use t1 to drive from l1_4 to l1_1. But cities have locations connected by trucks. Wait, the drivetruck action allows moving between any locations in the same city. So in city c1, locations l1_1 to l1_5. So t1 can drive from l1_4 to l1_1.

Wait, but initial location of t1 is l1_4. So steps for p1:

1. Load p1 into t1 at l1_4. Then drive t1 to l1_1. Then unload p1 at l1_1. Then load p1 into a1. Fly a1 to l2_1. Unload p1 into l2_1. Then load into t2 (but t2 is in l2_2). So need to drive t2 to l2_1. Then load p1 into t2, drive to l2_4. Unload.

But wait, the constraints require p1 to be in l2_1, which would happen during this process. Also, p1 must be in l1_1. That happens when we unload it there. Wait, no: If we load p1 into t1, drive to l1_1, unload p1 there. So p1 is in l1_1. Then load into a1. So that would satisfy the constraint that p1 is in l1_1.

But then, after flying to l2_1, p1 is in l2_1 (after unloading from a1). So that satisfies the first constraint (p1 in l2_1 at some state). But the first constraint also requires that before that state, p2 was in l1_2.

So we need to make sure that before p1 arrives in l2_1, p2 has been in l1_2.

Wait, the first constraint says: If p1 is in l2_1 in some state, there must be an earlier state where p2 is in l1_2.

So in the plan, when p1 is unloaded in l2_1, before that, there must be a state where p2 was in l1_2.

But p2 starts in l1_4. So we need to move p2 to l1_2 at some point before p1 arrives in l2_1.

But p2's goal is to stay in l1_4. So perhaps we need to move p2 out and back.

So, steps for p2:

Since p2 must end up in l1_4, but during the plan, it has to be in a2 (constraint 3), in l2_5 (constraint 6), and in l1_2 (constraint 1's prerequisite), and also in t2 (constraint 7: either p2 in t2 or p1 in l1_2. So maybe moving p2 into t2 would satisfy that).

Additionally, the constraint that when p1 is in l1_1, then either p2 is in l1_1 or l2_5 at that state or later. So when p1 is in l1_1 (after unloading from t1), we need to ensure that p2 is either in l1_1 or l2_5 at that time or later.

But how to handle all these constraints. Let's outline possible steps.

First, handling p1's movement:

1. Load p1 into t1 (l1_4), then drive t1 to l1_1. Unload p1 into l1_1. Then load into a1. Fly a1 to l2_1. Unload p1 into l2_1. Then drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1, load p1 into t2, drive to l2_4, unload.

But during this process, when p1 is in l1_1, we need to ensure that p2 is in l1_1 or l2_5 at that state or later.

But p2 starts in l1_4. To get p2 to l1_1, we can use t1. After driving t1 to l1_1 with p1, perhaps after unloading p1, we can drive t1 back to l1_4, load p2, drive to l1_1, unload. But that would make p2 in l1_1. But maybe that's an option.

Alternatively, to get p2 to l2_5, which is in c2. That would require moving p2 via airplane a2. So, first, load p2 into t1 (in l1_4), drive to l1_1, unload, load into a1, fly to l2_1, unload, load into t2, drive to l2_5, unload. But that's a lot of steps. But p2's goal is to be back in l1_4. So after moving p2 to l2_5, we need to bring it back. But that's complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps use a different approach. Let's break down each constraint and see how to satisfy them.

Constraints:

1. At least once: p1 in l2_1. Before that, p2 in l1_2.

2. At least once: p2 in a2.

3. At least once: p1 in l1_1.

4. Whenever p1 is in l1_1, then p2 is in l1_1 or l2_5 (at that state or later).

5. At least once: p2 in l2_5.

6. At least once: p2 in t2 or p1 in l1_2.

7. At least once: p1 in l2_5.

8. At least once: p1 in l2_3.

So, the plan must include these states.

Let's start by handling constraint 3: p1 must be in l1_1. So we need to move p1 to l1_1. That can be done by loading it into t1 (since t1 is in l1_4), driving to l1_1, and unloading. So steps:

loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1

unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

Now, p1 is in l1_1. At this state (or after), we need p2 to be in l1_1 or l2_5. Let's plan for that. Let's choose to have p2 in l2_5 (since constraint 5 requires it). So how to get p2 to l2_5.

But p2 is in l1_4 (c1). To get to l2_5 (c2), need to use airplane. But first, move p2 to airport l1_1, load into a1, fly to l2_1, unload, then load into t2 (drive to l2_5). But this would require:

For p2:

loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (but t1 is in l1_1 now after driving). Wait, after the previous steps, t1 is in l1_1. So we need to drive t1 back to l1_4 to load p2. Let's see:

After unloading p1 at l1_1, drive t1 back to l1_4:

drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1

unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

Now p2 is in l1_1. Then load into a1:

loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

Now p2 is in l2_1. Then load into t2 (but t2 is in l2_2). So drive t2 to l2_1:

drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2

loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2

unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5

Now p2 is in l2_5. Then, to get it back to l1_4, we need to reverse the process. But since the goal is to have p2 in l1_4, but the constraints require p2 to be in l2_5. So after moving it to l2_5, we need to bring it back. That's going to add steps. However, the goal requires p2 to be in l1_4, which is its initial location. So maybe during the plan, p2 is moved to l2_5 and then brought back.

But this is getting complicated. Let's check if this path satisfies the constraints:

- Constraint 5: p2 in l2_5. Yes, achieved.

- Constraint 4: when p1 is in l1_1 (after unloading), in that state, p2 is in l1_1 (after the second unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1). But then after that, p2 is moved to l2_5. So the condition holds because in the state after p1 is in l1_1, p2 is moved to l2_5 later.

But I need to make sure that whenever p1 is in l1_1, then either p2 is in l1_1 or l2_5 at that state or later. So after p1 is unloaded in l1_1, any time after that, if there's a state where p2 is in l2_5, that's okay. So during the plan, after p1 is in l1_1, we move p2 to l2_5, which satisfies constraint 4.

Now, constraint 2: p2 must be in a2. But in the current steps, p2 is loaded into a1, not a2. So to satisfy this, maybe we need to use a2 instead. Let's adjust.

Alternative approach: After getting p2 to l2_1 (using a1), then instead of using t2, perhaps load p2 into a2 (which is at l2_1). Wait, a2 is in l2_1 initially. So after flying a1 to l2_1, unload p2 into l2_1, then load into a2. Then fly a2 to l2_5's airport? Wait, l2_5 is a location in c2, but the airports are l2_1. So l2_5 is a regular location, not an airport. So to get to l2_5, must use a truck. So after unloading p2 at l2_1 via a1, load into t2, drive to l2_5. But that way, p2 is in t2, which satisfies the constraint 6 (p2 in t2). So constraint 6 is satisfied.

But to get p2 into a2, we need to load it into a2. So after unloading p2 from a1 into l2_1, load p2 into a2 (since a2 is at l2_1). Then unload into l2_1 again. But that doesn't help. Alternatively, fly a2 to another airport? Wait, the only other airport is l1_1. So perhaps after loading p2 into a2, fly to l1_1, but that would move p2 back to c1. But then to get to l2_5, need to use a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps load p2 into a2 at l2_1, then fly a2 to l2_1 (no effect), which is not useful. So perhaps this approach doesn't work. Maybe we need to first get p2 into a2 in a different way.

Alternatively, take p2 from l1_4 to l2_1 via a1, then load into a2. But a2 is in l2_1. So load p2 into a2 at l2_1, then unload. But that just puts p2 back in l2_1. Not helpful. Unless we fly a2 somewhere else. Wait, the flyairplane action can go between any airports. But the airports are l1_1 and l2_1. So to fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1, but that would take p2 (if loaded) to l1_1. Then unload there. But then to get p2 to l2_5, need to use truck t1 again. Hmm.

Alternatively, to get p2 into a2, maybe we can load p2 into a2 at l2_1. So steps:

After unloading p2 from a1 into l2_1, then load into a2 (loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1). Then fly a2 to l1_1. Unload p2 into l1_1. Then load into t1, drive to l1_4 (but that's the original location). But this would require a lot of steps. Also, need to bring p2 back to l1_4 at the end.

But this is getting too complicated. Let's think differently.

Another approach: Since p2 needs to be in a2 at some point, perhaps load p2 into a2 in l2_1. So how to get p2 to l2_1. Use a1 to fly p2 from l1_1 to l2_1. Then load into a2.

So steps for p2:

- Load p2 into t1 in l1_4, drive to l1_1, unload.

- Load into a1, fly to l2_1, unload.

- Load into a2, then fly a2 to l2_1 (no movement?), but unload. This doesn't help.

Alternatively, fly a2 to another airport. But there's only l1_1 and l2_1. So maybe fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1 with p2. But then p2 is in l1_1 again.

Alternatively, after loading p2 into a2 at l2_1, we can unload it there. But that just leaves it in l2_1, which doesn't help for getting to l2_5.

Wait, maybe after getting p2 into a2 at l2_1, fly a2 to l2_1 (no move), which is not useful. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the step where p2 is loaded into a2 is just to satisfy the constraint, then immediately unloaded. But that's possible. So load p2 into a2 at l2_1, then unload. So the state where p2 is in a2 is during the time it's loaded. So:

After p2 is in l2_1 (unloaded from a1), perform loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1. Now p2 is in a2. Then unload it (unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1). Now p2 is back in l2_1. But this satisfies the constraint that p2 was in a2 at some point.

But this would require adding those steps. Let's consider:

After flying a1 to l2_1 with p2, unload:

unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1.

Then load into a2:

loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1.

Then immediately unload:

unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1.

But this is redundant, but it satisfies the constraint. So p2 is in a2 during the loaded state. Then, to get p2 to l2_5, drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1, load p2 into t2, drive to l2_5, unload.

This way, constraint 2 is satisfied (p2 in a2), constraint 5 (p2 in l2_5). Then, after that, we need to bring p2 back to l1_4. But how?

Wait, the goal requires p2 to be in l1_4. So after moving it to l2_5, we need to bring it back. That would require flying it back using a2 or a1. But this complicates the plan.

Alternative idea: Maybe after moving p2 to l2_5, we can use a2 to fly it back to l1_1, then use t1 to drive back to l1_4. But this adds steps. Let's see:

After p2 is in l2_5 (unloaded from t2):

loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5.

drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2.

unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.

loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1.

flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1.

loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1.

unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4.

But this brings p2 back to l1_4, which is the goal. However, this adds a lot of steps. But maybe necessary.

Now, let's check all constraints:

1. p1 in l2_1: happens when p1 is unloaded from a1 into l2_1.

   Before that, p2 must have been in l1_2. So when does p2 get to l1_2? 

Wait, in the current plan steps, p2 is moved to l1_1, then to l2_1, then into a2, then to l2_5, then back. There's no step where p2 is in l1_2. So we need to add that.

So constraint 1 says that if p1 is in l2_1, then there must be an earlier state where p2 was in l1_2.

So we need to ensure that before p1 arrives in l2_1, p2 was in l1_2.

So in the current plan, p1 is moved to l1_1, then flown to l2_1. Before that flight, we need to have p2 in l1_2.

So how to get p2 to l1_2.

Since p2 starts in l1_4 (c1), we can use t1 to drive p2 to l1_2.

But t1 is initially in l1_4. So steps:

After loading and unloading p1 into l1_1, drive t1 back to l1_4 (as before), load p2, drive to l1_2, unload. Then proceed.

Wait, but let's outline:

Original steps for p1:

1. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1

3. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

At this point, p1 is in l1_1 (satisfies constraint 3). Then, to fly p1 to l2_1:

4. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

6. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

Now, p1 is in l2_1. Before this step (state 6), there must be a state where p2 is in l1_2.

So before step 6, we need to have p2 in l1_2.

So steps for p2:

After step 3 (unload p1 in l1_1), drive t1 back to l1_4.

7. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

8. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

9. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1

10. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

Now, p2 is in l1_2. This satisfies the prerequisite for constraint 1. Then, proceed to move p2 to l1_1, load into a1, etc.

But this adds steps. So after step 10, we can drive t1 to l1_1 again to load p2 into a1:

11. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1

12. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 → wait, no. After step 10, p2 is in l1_2. To get p2 to l1_1, need to load into t1 again and drive. But t1 is in l1_2 after step 9.

So steps:

After step 10 (p2 in l1_2):

11. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

12. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1

13. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

Now, p2 is in l1_1. Then load into a1:

14. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

15. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

16. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

Then load into a2:

17. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

18. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

Then drive t2 to l2_1:

19. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2

20. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

21. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2

22. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5

Then bring p2 back:

23. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5

24. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2

25. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

26. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

27. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

28. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

29. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

30. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

31. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

Now, this brings p2 back to l1_4. 

But also, during this process, p1 is in l2_1 (step 6). After that, p1 needs to be moved to l2_4. So steps after step 6:

32. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 → but t2 is at l2_1 after step 19.

Wait, step 19: drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2. That's done to load p2. So after step 19, t2 is in l2_1. But step 20 is loading p2 into t2. Then steps 21-25 involve moving p2 to l2_5 and back. Then, after step 25, t2 is back in l2_1.

So after step 6 (p1 in l2_1), we need to load p1 into t2 and drive to l2_4.

But during steps 7-31, t2 is being used to move p2. So maybe we need to interleave the steps.

This is getting very complex. Perhaps there's a more optimal way.

Alternatively, after moving p1 to l2_1 (step 6), we can load p1 into t2 (which needs to be driven to l2_1 first). So steps:

After step 6 (unload p1 in l2_1):

7. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2

8. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

9. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2

10. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 → this achieves the goal for p1.

But during this, we need to handle p2's steps as well. But how to fit all the constraints.

But perhaps we can find a way to satisfy the constraints with fewer steps.

Let's try to outline a possible plan step-by-step, considering all constraints:

1. Load p1 into t1 at l1_4.

2. Drive t1 to l1_1.

3. Unload p1 at l1_1. (Now p1 is in l1_1, satisfying constraint 3)

4. Load p1 into a1.

5. Fly a1 to l2_1.

6. Unload p1 into l2_1. (Now p1 is in l2_1, so constraint 1 requires that before this step, p2 was in l1_2.)

So before step 6, we need p2 in l1_2.

So steps for p2:

7. Drive t1 back to l1_4 (after step 3).

8. Load p2 into t1.

9. Drive t1 to l1_2.

10. Unload p2 in l1_2. (Now p2 is in l1_2, satisfying the prerequisite for constraint 1)

Now, before proceeding with p1's steps (steps 4-6), we need to ensure that steps 7-10 are done before step 6.

But the plan is sequential. So the order would be:

1. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1

3. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 → p1 in l1_1 (constraint 3)

4. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1 → drive t1 back to l1_4

5. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

6. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1 → drive to l1_2

7. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 → p2 in l1_2 (before p1 is in l2_1)

Now, proceed with p1's steps:

8. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 → a1 is at l1_1

9. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

10. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 → p1 in l2_1 (constraint 1 met, as step 7 was before)

Now, move p1 to l2_4:

11. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 → drive t2 to l2_1

12. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

13. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2

14. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 → goal for p1 achieved.

Now, handle p2's constraints:

After step 7, p2 is in l1_2. We need to get p2 into a2 (constraint 2), into l2_5 (constraint 5), and into t2 (constraint 6).

Also, constraint 4: when p1 is in l1_1 (step 3), then p2 must be in l1_1 or l2_5 at that state or later. At step 3, p2 is in l1_4. But after step 7, p2 is in l1_2. Then later, we need to get p2 to l2_5. So after step 3, we have steps that move p2 to l2_5, which satisfies constraint 4.

So steps for p2:

15. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 → t1 is in l1_2 after step 6

16. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 → drive to l1_1

17. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 → p2 in l1_1

18. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 → but a1 is now in l2_1. Wait, after step 9, a1 flew to l2_1, so a1 is no longer in l1_1. So this is a problem. Can't load into a1 at l1_1 after it has flown away.

Ah, this is a mistake. So after step 9, a1 is in l2_1. So step 18 cannot load p2 into a1 at l1_1. So need to use a different airplane.

Wait, a2 is in l2_1. So to move p2 to c2, need to use a different airplane. But how?

Alternative idea: After step 7 (p2 in l1_2), drive t1 back to l1_1, load p2 into a2. But a2 is in l2_1. So can't load into a2 from l1_1. So this won't work.

Alternative approach: Use a different airplane. But there's a1 and a2. a1 is in l1_1 initially, but after step 9, it's in l2_1. So to move p2 from l1_2 to c2, we need to get p2 to an airport (l1_1 or l2_1) and then fly.

So steps after step 7 (p2 in l1_2):

15. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

16. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 → drive to l1_1

17. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 → p2 in l1_1

18. loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 → but a2 is in l2_1. Can't load into a2 unless it's in l1_1.

So need to fly a2 to l1_1. But a2 starts in l2_1. So:

Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1:

18. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 → now a2 is in l1_1

19. loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 → p2 in a2 (satisfies constraint 2)

20. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1 → back to l2_1

21. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 → p2 in l2_1

Now, to get p2 to l2_5:

22. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2 (but t2 is in l2_1 after step 11)

Wait, after step 11, t2 is driven to l2_1. Then in step 12, p1 is loaded into t2. So after step 14, t2 is in l2_4. So after step 14, t2 is in l2_4. So to move p2 from l2_1 to l2_5, we need another truck. But there's only t2 in c2. So after step 14 (t2 in l2_4), we can drive t2 back to l2_1 to load p2:

23. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2

24. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

25. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2

26. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 → p2 in l2_5 (constraint 5)

Now, p2 is in l2_5. Need to bring it back to l1_4. So:

27. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5

28. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2

29. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

30. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

31. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

32. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

33. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 → t1 is in l1_1 after step 16

34. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

35. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 → p2 back to goal location.

This is a very long plan, but let's check constraints:

- p1 in l2_1 (step 10): yes. Before that, p2 in l1_2 (step 7): yes.

- p2 in a2 (step 19): yes.

- p1 in l1_1 (step 3): yes. After that, p2 is in l2_5 (step 26) which is after.

- p2 in l2_5: step 26.

- At some state, p2 in t2 (steps 24,25,27, etc.) or p1 in l1_2. p1 is never in l1_2, but p2 is in t2 (steps 24,25, etc.), so constraint 6 is met.

- p1 in l2_3: Wait, one of the constraints requires p1 to be in l2_3 and l2_5. But in the current plan, p1 is moved from l2_1 to l2_4 via t2, but doesn't go through l2_3 or l2_5. So this is a problem. 

Oh right, the constraints also require:

7. At least once: p1 in l2_5.

8. At least once: p1 in l2_3.

So in the current plan, p1 is moved to l2_4, but never to l2_3 or l2_5. So we need to adjust the plan.

This complicates things further. So how to get p1 to l2_3 and l2_5.

Maybe after p1 is in l2_1, drive t2 to l2_3, then l2_5, then l2_4. But this adds steps.

So steps after step 10 (p1 in l2_1):

11. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 → t2 to l2_1.

12. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

13. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2 → p1 in l2_3 (constraint 8)

14. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 → no, but we need to keep p1 in the truck or reload.

Wait, if we unload p1 in l2_3, then reload to continue to l2_5 and l2_4. But that's more steps. Alternatively, just pass through l2_3 and l2_5 without unloading.

But the constraints require that p1 is in l2_3 and l2_5 at some state. So just driving through won't make p1 be in those locations; p1 is in the truck. So the location of p1 is the truck's location. So if the truck is in l2_3, then p1 is in l2_3 (since it's in the truck there). So the state after step 13 (drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3) would have p1 in t2, which is in l2_3. So the package's location is considered as being in the truck's location. So, does that count as p1 being in l2_3? Because when a package is in a truck, it is considered to be in the truck's current location. So yes, when the truck is in l2_3, p1 is in l2_3 (inside the truck). Similarly for l2_5.

So to satisfy constraints 7 and 8:

After loading p1 into t2 in l2_1 (step 12), drive t2 to l2_3 (step 13), then to l2_5 (step 14), then to l2_4 (step 15), and unload.

So steps:

12. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

13. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2 → p1 in l2_3 (constraint 8)

14. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2 → p1 in l2_5 (constraint 7)

15. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2 → p1 in l2_4

16. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 → goal achieved.

This way, p1 is in l2_3 and l2_5 during the driving steps. So those constraints are satisfied.

But this adds more steps. Now, let's adjust the plan accordingly.

Integrating all steps, the plan becomes:

1. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1

3. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

4. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

5. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

6. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1

7. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

8. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

9. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1

10. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

11. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

12. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

13. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

14. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

15. loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

16. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1

17. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

18. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2

19. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

20. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2

21. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5

22. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5

23. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2

24. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

25. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

26. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

27. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

28. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

29. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

30. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

31. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

32. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2

33. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2

34. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2

35. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

But this is extremely long and may not be optimal. Also, need to check if all constraints are met:

- p1 in l2_1 (step 13): yes.

- Before that, p2 in l1_2 (step 7): yes.

- p2 in a2 (step 15, 25): yes.

- p1 in l1_1 (step 3): yes.

- When p1 is in l1_1, after that p2 is in l2_5 (step 21): yes.

- p2 in l2_5 (step 21): yes.

- p2 in t2 (steps 19, 22): yes.

- p1 in l2_3 (step 32): yes.

- p1 in l2_5 (step 33): yes.

This satisfies all constraints. But the plan is very long. However, the problem requires an optimal plan, which is as short as possible. So perhaps there's a shorter way.

Alternative idea: Combine steps where possible. For example, after moving p1 to l2_1, drive t2 to l2_1, then load p1 and drive through l2_3, l2_5 to l2_4. That adds two steps but satisfies two constraints.

Similarly, when moving p2 to l2_5, perhaps we can do it in a way that also satisfies other constraints.

But perhaps this is the minimal plan given the constraints. However, the user expects an optimal plan, so we need to find the shortest possible.

Let me try to find a shorter path:

1. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 → t1 in l1_1

3. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 → p1 in l1_1 (constraint 3)

4. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 → p1 in a1

5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 → a1 in l2_1

6. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 → p1 in l2_1 (constraint 1)

   Before this, need p2 in l1_2.

7. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 → but t1 is in l1_1. But p2 is in l1_4. So this can't happen. Wait, p2 is initially in l1_4. To get p2 to l1_2, need to use t1:

But after step 2, t1 is in l1_1. So steps for p2:

7. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1 → drive back

8. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

9. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1

10. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 → p2 in l1_2 (before step 6)

Now, after step 10, p2 is in l1_2. Then proceed to steps 4-6.

But steps 4-6 would have to be after step 10. So reordering:

1. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 → t1 in l1_1

3. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 → p1 in l1_1

4. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1 → t1 back to l1_4

5. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

6. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1 → t1 to l1_2

7. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 → p2 in l1_2

8. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 → p1 loaded into a1

9. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

10. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 → p1 in l2_1 (constraint 1 met)

Now, move p1 to l2_3, l2_5, and l2_4:

11. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 → t2 to l2_1

12. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

13. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2 → p1 in l2_3 (constraint 8)

14. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2 → p1 in l2_5 (constraint 7)

15. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2 → p1 in l2_4

16. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 → goal for p1

Now, handle p2's constraints:

17. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 → t1 in l1_2

18. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 → to l1_1

19. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 → p2 in l1_1

20. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 → a2 to l1_1 (from l2_1)

21. loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 → p2 in a2 (constraint 2)

22. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1 → back to l2_1

23. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 → p2 in l2_1

24. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2 → t2 back to l2_1 (after step 16)

25. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

26. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2 → p2 in l2_5 (constraint 5)

27. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 

Now, p2 needs to be in l1_4 at the end:

28. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 

29. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2

30. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

31. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

32. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

33. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

34. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 → t1 is in l1_1 after step 18

35. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

36. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 → p2 back to goal

But this is still a very long plan. It seems that due to the numerous constraints, the plan cannot be much shorter. However, maybe there's a more optimal way.

Alternative approach: Use a2 to fly p2 directly from l1_1 to l2_5's airport. But l2_5 is not an airport. So we have to use truck in c2. 

Alternatively, after moving p2 to l1_1, load into a2 (after flying a2 to l1_1), fly to l2_1, unload, then drive to l2_5. 

But this requires fewer steps.

Let's try:

Steps after p1 is in l2_4 (step 16):

17. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 → a2 to l1_1

18. loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 → p2 in a2 (constraint 2)

19. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1 → a2 to l2_1

20. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 → p2 in l2_1

21. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2 → t2 back to l2_1

22. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

23. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2 → p2 in l2_5 (constraint 5)

24. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 

25. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 

26. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2

27. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

28. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

29. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

30. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

31. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 → t1 is in l1_1 after step 18

32. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

33. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 

This still requires many steps, but perhaps this is necessary.

Now, checking all constraints:

- p1 in l2_1 (step 10): yes.

- Before step 10, p2 in l1_2 (step 7): yes.

- p2 in a2 (step 18): yes.

- p1 in l1_1 (step 3): yes. After that, p2 is moved to l2_5 (step 23): yes.

- p2 in l2_5: step 23.

- p2 in t2 (steps 22, 25): yes.

- p1 in l2_3 (step 13): yes.

- p1 in l2_5 (step 14): yes.

- The constraint 6 (p2 in t2 or p1 in l1_2) is met by p2 in t2.

All constraints are satisfied. The plan is long but seems to meet all requirements.

Now, let's write this plan step-by-step, ensuring the correct order.

Final plan steps:

```
```
1. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
3. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
4. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
5. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
6. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1
7. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
8. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
9. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
10. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
11. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
12. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
13. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
14. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
15. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
16. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
17. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2
18. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2
19. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
20. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
21. loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
22. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
23. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
24. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
25. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
26. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
27. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
28. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
29. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
30. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
31. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
32. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
33. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
34. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
35. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
```
```

But this is 35 steps. However, perhaps some steps can be optimized.

For example, after step 19 (unload p1 in l2_4), we can fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1 (step 20), load p2 (step 21), fly back (step 22), unload (step 23), etc. But perhaps some steps can be merged or reordered.

Alternatively, after step 10 (p2 in l1_1), instead of loading p1 into a1 (step 11), maybe load p2 into a2 directly if possible.

Wait, step 10: p2 is in l1_1. a2 is in l2_1. So to load p2 into a2, a2 needs to be in l1_1. So need to fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1:

Insert steps:

10.5: flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

11. loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 → p2 in a2 (constraint 2)

12. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1

13. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 → p2 in l2_1

Then proceed to move p2 to l2_5.

But this would insert steps between step 10 and 11.

But this may reduce the total steps. Let me try:

Revised steps after step 10 (p2 in l1_1):

10.5. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

11. loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 → p2 in a2 (constraint 2)

12. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1

13. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 → p2 in l2_1

14. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

15. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2 → p2 in l2_5 (constraint 5)

16. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5

Then bring p2 back:

17. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5

18. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2

19. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

20. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

21. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

22. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

23. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

24. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

25. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

This way, steps for p2 after step 10 are reduced.

But integrating this into the main plan:

Revised steps:

1. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1

3. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 → p1 in l1_1 (constraint 3)

4. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

5. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

6. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1

7. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 → p2 in l1_2 (before p1 in l2_1)

8. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

9. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1

10. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 → p2 in l1_1

11. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 → move a2 to l1_1

12. loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 → p2 in a2 (constraint 2)

13. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1 → back to l2_1

14. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 → p2 in l2_1

15. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 → load p1 into a1

16. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 → fly to l2_1

17. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 → p1 in l2_1 (constraint 1)

18. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 → move t2 to l2_1

19. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 → load p1 into t2

20. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2 → p1 in l2_3 (constraint 8)

21. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2 → p1 in l2_5 (constraint 7)

22. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2 → p1 in l2_4

23. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 → goal for p1

24. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 → after step 14, p2 is in l2_1

25. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2 → p2 in l2_5 (constraint 5)

26. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 

27. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 

28. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 

29. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 

30. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 

31. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 

32. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 

33. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 

34. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1 

35. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 → goal for p2

This reduces some steps but still requires 35 steps. However, some steps can be reordered. For example, after step 14 (p2 in l2_1), steps 24-29 can be done before moving p1. But this might not reduce the total steps.

Alternatively, after step 14 (p2 in l2_1), we can load p2 into t2 and move to l2_5:

24. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

25. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2 → p2 in l2_5 (constraint 5)

26. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 

Then, after moving p1 to l2_4, bring p2 back.

But this may save steps.

Overall, due to the numerous constraints, the plan is lengthy. However, considering the problem requires an optimal plan (shortest possible), perhaps there's a shorter way that I'm missing. But given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the plan I've outlined, ensuring all constraints are met.
