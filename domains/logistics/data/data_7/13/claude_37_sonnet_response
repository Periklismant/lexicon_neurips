Let me understand the problem. I'm tasked with creating a valid plan to move packages p1 and p2 to their target locations, while abiding by a set of constraints. Let's first understand the initial state, the goal state, and the constraints.

Initial State:
- Package t1 is in location l1_4
- Package t2 is in location l2_2
- Package p1 is in location l1_4
- Package p2 is in location l1_4
- Package a1 is in location l1_1
- Package a2 is in location l2_1

Wait, there seems to be a mistake in the initial state. Trucks (t1, t2) and airplanes (a1, a2) are described as packages. Let me correct this in my understanding:

Initial State:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_4
- Truck t2 is in location l2_2
- Package p1 is in location l1_4
- Package p2 is in location l1_4
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

Goal State:
- Package p1 is in location l2_4
- Package p2 is in location l1_4

Note: Since p2 is already in location l1_4 in the initial state, it doesn't need to be moved.

Constraints:
1. p1 must be in location l2_1 at some point.
2. If p1 is in l2_1, p2 must have been in l1_2 earlier.
3. p2 must be in a2 at some point.
4. p1 must be in location l1_1 at some point.
5. If p1 is in l1_1, then either p2 is in l1_1 or p2 is in l2_5 at that state or some state after.
6. p2 must be in location l2_5 at some point.
7. Either p2 is in t2 or p1 is in location l1_2 at some point.
8. p1 must be in location l2_5 at some point.
9. p1 must be in location l2_3 at some point.

Let me analyze how the constraints affect our plan:

- Constraint 1: p1 must be in l2_1 at some point.
- Constraint 2: Before p1 is in l2_1, p2 must be in l1_2.
- Constraint 3: p2 must be in a2 at some point.
- Constraint 4: p1 must be in l1_1 at some point.
- Constraint 5: If p1 is in l1_1, then p2 must be in l1_1 or l2_5 at that point or later.
- Constraint 6: p2 must be in l2_5 at some point.
- Constraint 7: Either p2 is in t2 or p1 is in l1_2 at some point.
- Constraint 8: p1 must be in l2_5 at some point.
- Constraint 9: p1 must be in l2_3 at some point.

Now, let's start crafting our plan. We need to ensure that all constraints are satisfied, and the goal state is reached.

First, let's note that in the initial state, p1 and p2 are both in l1_4, so we can start by moving them to satisfy our constraints.

Let's think about the sequence. Constraint 2 says that before p1 is in l2_1, p2 must be in l1_2. So, let's start by moving p2 to l1_2.

At a high level, our plan needs to meet the following checkpoints:
1. P2 starts in l1_4
2. Move p2 to l1_2 (to satisfy Constraint 2, which is a prerequisite for Constraint 1)
3. Move p1 to l2_1 (to satisfy Constraint 1)
4. Put p2 in a2 (to satisfy Constraint 3)
5. Move p1 to l1_1 (to satisfy Constraint 4)
6. At or after this point, p2 must be in l1_1 or l2_5 (to satisfy Constraint 5)
7. Move p2 to l2_5 (to satisfy Constraint 6)
8. Ensure either p2 is in t2 or p1 is in l1_2 (to satisfy Constraint 7)
9. Move p1 to l2_5 (to satisfy Constraint 8)
10. Move p1 to l2_3 (to satisfy Constraint 9)
11. Finally, move p1 to l2_4 and ensure p2 is back in l1_4 (to satisfy the goal)

Let's think about the most efficient way to satisfy these checkpoints.

1-2. First, we need to move p2 from l1_4 to l1_2. We can use t1, which is already in l1_4.
3. Move p1 to l2_1. We'll need to use a1 for this.
4. Put p2 in a2. We'll need to move p2 to an airport (either l1_1 or l2_1) and then load it onto a2.
5. Move p1 to l1_1. Since we're using a1 to move p1 to l2_1, we can also use a1 to move it to l1_1.
6-7. Move p2 to l2_5. We can use a2 for this.
8. If we're using t2 to move p2, we can ensure p2 is in t2 at some point. Alternatively, we can ensure p1 is in l1_2 at some point.
9. Move p1 to l2_5.
10. Move p1 to l2_3.
11. Move p1 to l2_4 and ensure p2 is back in l1_4.

Now, let's draft a more detailed plan.

Let's first figure out the general route for both packages considering all the constraints. Then, I'll map out the specific actions.

Package p1 Route (need to end at l2_4):
1. Start in l1_4.
2. Possibly go to l1_2 (for Constraint 7, if not using t2 for p2).
3. Go to l1_1 (for Constraint 4).
4. Go to l2_1 (for Constraint 1, but only after p2 has been in l1_2).
5. Go to l2_3 (for Constraint 9).
6. Go to l2_5 (for Constraint 8).
7. End in l2_4 (goal).

Package p2 Route (need to end at l1_4):
1. Start in l1_4.
2. Go to l1_2 (for Constraint 2).
3. Go to an airport to be loaded onto a2 (for Constraint 3).
4. Go to l2_5 (for Constraint 6).
5. End in l1_4 (goal).

With this in mind, let's draft the plan in more detail:

1. Move t1 from l1_4 to l1_2: drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1
2. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_4: loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
3. Drive t1 to l1_2: drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1
4. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_2: unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
5. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_2: loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 (for Constraint 7, satisfying p1 is in l1_2)
6. Drive t1 to l1_1: drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
7. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1: unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (satisfying p1 is in l1_1, Constraint 4)
8. Load p1 onto a1 at l1_1: loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
9. Fly a1 to l2_1: flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
10. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1: unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 (satisfying p1 is in l2_1, Constraint 1)
11. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_2: loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (Re-picking up p2)
12. Drive t1 to l1_1: drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
13. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1: unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (or we can keep it in t1 and continue, since we'll need to transport it)
14. Load p2 onto a2 at l1_1: loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (Wait, a2 is in l2_1, not l1_1)

Ok, there's an issue. We need to get p2 into a2, but a2 is at l2_1, and we're planning to move p2 from l1_2 to l1_1. 

Let me rethink the route for p2. We need to move it to an airport (l1_1 or l2_1) where a2 is present. Given that a2 is initially at l2_1, we'll need to either move a2 to l1_1 or move p2 to l2_1.

Hmm, I think we need to rethink this more carefully. Let's continue to analyze, step by step, while keeping in mind the state of the world at each point.

Let me start with the initial state:

Location l1_1 is an airport in city c1
Location l1_2 is in city c1
Location l1_3 is in city c1
Location l1_4 is in city c1
Location l1_5 is in city c1
Location l2_1 is an airport in city c2
Location l2_2 is in city c2
Location l2_3 is in city c2
Location l2_4 is in city c2
Location l2_5 is in city c2
Truck t1 is in location l1_4
Truck t2 is in location l2_2
Package p1 is in location l1_4
Package p2 is in location l1_4
Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

Now, let's trace an actual plan:

1. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_4: loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
2. Drive t1 to l1_2: drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1
3. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_2: unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (satisfying p2 is in l1_2, prerequisite for Constraint 2)
4. Drive t1 back to l1_4: drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1
5. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_4: loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
6. Drive t1 to l1_2: drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1 (satisfying p1 is in l1_2, an option for Constraint 7)
7. Drive t1 to l1_1: drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
8. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1: unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (satisfying p1 is in l1_1, Constraint 4)
9. Load p1 onto a1 at l1_1: loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
10. Fly a1 to l2_1: flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
11. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1: unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 (satisfying p1 is in l2_1, Constraint 1)
12. Drive t1 to l1_2: drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
13. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_2: loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
14. Drive t1 to l1_1: drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
15. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1: unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (satisfying p2 is in l1_1, one option for Constraint 5)
16. Load p2 onto airplane a1 at l1_1: loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
17. Fly a1 to l2_1: flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
18. Unload p2 from a1 at l2_1: unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
19. Load p2 onto a2 at l2_1: loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (satisfying p2 is in a2, Constraint 3)
20. Fly a2 to l1_1: flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
21. Fly a2 back to l2_1: flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
22. Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1: loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
23. Fly a2 to l1_1: flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
24. Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1: unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
25. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_1: loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
26. Drive t1 to l1_4: drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
27. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_4: unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (satisfying p2 is in l1_4, goal)
28. Fly a2 to l2_1: flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
29. Unload p1 from a2 at l2_1: unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
30. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_2: loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (wait, we have a problem, p1 is in l2_1, but t2 is in l2_2)

Let me rethink this.

Starting from the initial state, let's begin with precise actions:

1. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_4: loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 
   - Now p2 is in t1.
2. Drive t1 to l1_2: drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1 
   - Now t1 is in l1_2.
3. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_2: unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 
   - Now p2 is in l1_2 (satisfying the prerequisite for Constraint 2).
4. Drive t1 back to l1_4: drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1 
   - Now t1 is in l1_4.
5. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_4: loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4 
   - Now p1 is in t1.
6. Drive t1 to l1_2: drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1 
   - Now t1 is in l1_2 with p1 in it (satisfying p1 is in l1_2, one option for Constraint 7).

Now, let's consider the constraints:
- We've satisfied the prerequisite for Constraint 2 (p2 is in l1_2).
- We've satisfied one option for Constraint 7 (p1 is in l1_2).

Next, we need to:
- Move p1 to l1_1 (Constraint 4)
- Move p1 to l2_1 (Constraint 1)
- Put p2 in a2 (Constraint 3)
- Move p2 to l2_5 (Constraint 6)
- Move p1 to l2_5 (Constraint 8)
- Move p1 to l2_3 (Constraint 9)
- Ensure p1 ends up in l2_4 (goal)
- Ensure p2 ends up in l1_4 (goal)

Let's continue:

7. Drive t1 to l1_1: drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 
   - Now t1 is in l1_1 with p1 in it.
8. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1: unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 
   - Now p1 is in l1_1 (satisfying Constraint 4).

Since p1 is in l1_1, Constraint 5 requires that p2 is either in l1_1 or l2_5 at this time or later. Let's move p2 to l1_1 for now.

9. Drive t1 to l1_2: drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1 
   - Now t1 is in l1_2.
10. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_2: loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 
    - Now p2 is in t1.
11. Drive t1 to l1_1: drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 
    - Now t1 is in l1_1 with p2 in it.
12. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1: unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 
    - Now p2 is in l1_1 (satisfying one option for Constraint 5).

Next, we need to move p1 to l2_1 (Constraint 1).

13. Load p1 onto a1 at l1_1: loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 
    - Now p1 is in a1.
14. Fly a1 to l2_1: flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 
    - Now a1 is in l2_1 with p1 in it.
15. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1: unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 
    - Now p1 is in l2_1 (satisfying Constraint 1).

Now, we need to put p2 in a2 (Constraint 3). First, we need to get p2 to l2_1 where a2 is located.

16. Load p2 onto a1 at l1_1: loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 
    - Now p2 is in a1 (note: a1 is back in l1_1 at this point, so we might need to adjust the plan).

Actually, I realize I made an inconsistency: a1 should be at l2_1 now, not l1_1. Let me backtrack a bit.

Let's continue from step 15 where p1 is in l2_1 and a1 is in l2_1.

16. Fly a1 back to l1_1: flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1 
    - Now a1 is in l1_1.
17. Load p2 onto a1 at l1_1: loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 
    - Now p2 is in a1.
18. Fly a1 to l2_1: flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 
    - Now a1 is in l2_1 with p2 in it.
19. Unload p2 from a1 at l2_1: unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 
    - Now p2 is in l2_1.
20. Load p2 onto a2 at l2_1: loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 
    - Now p2 is in a2 (satisfying Constraint 3).

Next, we need to move p2 to l2_5 (Constraint 6).

21. Fly a2 to l2_1: flyairplane a2 l2_1 l2_1 (I made a mistake here; a2 is already at l2_1)
22. Unload p2 from a2 at l2_1: unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 
    - Now p2 is again in l2_1.
23. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_2: loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 
    (wait, we have a problem; p2 is in l2_1, but t2 is in l2_2)

Let me backtrack and rethink this. I need to be more precise about the locations of the vehicles and packages at each step.

Starting from the initial state, let's specify where everything is at each step:

Initial state:
- t1 in l1_4
- t2 in l2_2
- p1 in l1_4
- p2 in l1_4
- a1 in l1_1
- a2 in l2_1

1. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_4: loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 
   - t1 in l1_4 with p2 in it
   - p1 in l1_4
   - t2 in l2_2
   - a1 in l1_1
   - a2 in l2_1
2. Drive t1 to l1_2: drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1 
   - t1 in l1_2 with p2 in it
   - p1 in l1_4
   - t2 in l2_2
   - a1 in l1_1
   - a2 in l2_1
3. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_2: unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 
   - t1 in l1_2
   - p2 in l1_2 (satisfying the prerequisite for Constraint 2)
   - p1 in l1_4
   - t2 in l2_2
   - a1 in l1_1
   - a2 in l2_1
4. Drive t1 back to l1_4: drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1 
   - t1 in l1_4
   - p2 in l1_2
   - p1 in l1_4
   - t2 in l2_2
   - a1 in l1_1
   - a2 in l2_1
5. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_4: loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4 
   - t1 in l1_4 with p1 in it
   - p2 in l1_2
   - t2 in l2_2
   - a1 in l1_1
   - a2 in l2_1
6. Drive t1 to l1_2: drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1 
   - t1 in l1_2 with p1 in it
   - p2 in l1_2
   - t2 in l2_2
   - a1 in l1_1
   - a2 in l2_1
   - p1 is in l1_2 (satisfying one option for Constraint 7)
7. Drive t1 to l1_1: drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 
   - t1 in l1_1 with p1 in it
   - p2 in l1_2
   - t2 in l2_2
   - a1 in l1_1
   - a2 in l2_1
8. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1: unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 
   - t1 in l1_1
   - p1 in l1_1 (satisfying Constraint 4)
   - p2 in l1_2
   - t2 in l2_2
   - a1 in l1_1
   - a2 in l2_1

Now, Constraint 5 requires that if p1 is in l1_1, then p2 is in l1_1 or l2_5 at that time or later. Let's move p2 to l1_1.

9. Drive t1 to l1_2: drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1 
   - t1 in l1_2
   - p1 in l1_1
   - p2 in l1_2
   - t2 in l2_2
   - a1 in l1_1
   - a2 in l2_1
10. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_2: loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 
    - t1 in l1_2 with p2 in it
    - p1 in l1_1
    - t2 in l2_2
    - a1 in l1_1
    - a2 in l2_1
11. Drive t1 to l1_1: drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 
    - t1 in l1_1 with p2 in it
    - p1 in l1_1
    - t2 in l2_2
    - a1 in l1_1
    - a2 in l2_1
12. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1: unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 
    - t1 in l1_1
    - p1 in l1_1
    - p2 in l1_1 (satisfying one option for Constraint 5)
    - t2 in l2_2
    - a1 in l1_1
    - a2 in l2_1

Let's now move p1 to l2_1 (Constraint 1).

13. Load p1 onto a1 at l1_1: loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 
    - t1 in l1_1
    - p1 in a1
    - p2 in l1_1
    - t2 in l2_2
    - a1 in l1_1 with p1 in it
    - a2 in l2_1
14. Fly a1 to l2_1: flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 
    - t1 in l1_1
    - p1 in a1
    - p2 in l1_1
    - t2 in l2_2
    - a1 in l2_1 with p1 in it
    - a2 in l2_1
15. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1: unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 
    - t1 in l1_1
    - p1 in l2_1 (satisfying Constraint 1)
    - p2 in l1_1
    - t2 in l2_2
    - a1 in l2_1
    - a2 in l2_1

We now need to put p2 in a2 (Constraint 3). First, we need to get p2 to l2_1 where a2 is located.

16. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_1: loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 
    - t1 in l1_1 with p2 in it
    - p1 in l2_1
    - t2 in l2_2
    - a1 in l2_1
    - a2 in l2_1
17. Drive t1 to l1_1: drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_1 c1 (redundant step, removing)
18. Fly a1 back to l1_1: flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1 
    - t1 in l1_1 with p2 in it
    - p1 in l2_1
    - t2 in l2_2
    - a1 in l1_1
    - a2 in l2_1
19. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1: unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 
    - t1 in l1_1
    - p1 in l2_1
    - p2 in l1_1
    - t2 in l2_2
    - a1 in l1_1
    - a2 in l2_1
20. Load p2 onto a1 at l1_1: loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 
    - t1 in l1_1
    - p1 in l2_1
    - p2 in a1
    - t2 in l2_2
    - a1 in l1_1 with p2 in it
    - a2 in l2_1
21. Fly a1 to l2_1: flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 
    - t1 in l1_1
    - p1 in l2_1
    - p2 in a1
    - t2 in l2_2
    - a1 in l2_1 with p2 in it
    - a2 in l2_1
22. Unload p2 from a1 at l2_1: unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 
    - t1 in l1_1
    - p1 in l2_1
    - p2 in l2_1
    - t2 in l2_2
    - a1 in l2_1
    - a2 in l2_1
23. Load p2 onto a2 at l2_1: loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 
    - t1 in l1_1
    - p1 in l2_1
    - p2 in a2 (satisfying Constraint 3)
    - t2 in l2_2
    - a1 in l2_1
    - a2 in l2_1 with p2 in it

Next, we need to move p2 to l2_5 (Constraint 6). Let's use a2 to fly it there, or more precisely, fly to the airport of city c2 (l2_1) and then use a truck to drive it to l2_5.

24. Unload p2 from a2 at l2_1: unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 
    - t1 in l1_1
    - p1 in l2_1
    - p2 in l2_1
    - t2 in l2_2
    - a1 in l2_1
    - a2 in l2_1
25. Drive t2 to l2_1: drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 
    - t1 in l1_1
    - p1 in l2_1
    - p2 in l2_1
    - t2 in l2_1
    - a1 in l2_1
    - a2 in l2_1
26. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_1: loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

    - p1 in l2_1
    - p2 in t2
    - t2 in l2_1 with p2 in it
    - a1 in l2_1
    - a2 in l2_1
    - p2 is in t2 (satisfying one option for Constraint 7)
27. Drive t2 to l2_5: drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2 
    - t1 in l1_1
    - p1 in l2_1
    - p2 in t2
    - t2 in l2_5 with p2 in it
    - a1 in l2_1
    - a2 in l2_1
28. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_5: unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 
    - t1 in l1_1
    - p1 in l2_1
    - p2 in l2_5 (satisfying Constraint 6)
    - t2 in l2_5
    - a1 in l2_1
    - a2 in l2_1

Next, we need to move p1 to l2_5 (Constraint 8) and l2_3 (Constraint 9), and then to l2_4 (goal). We also need to get p2 back to l1_4 (goal).

29. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_1: loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (inconsistency: t2 is in l2_5, not l2_1)

Let me backtrack. t2 is in l2_5 and p1 is in l2_1. We need to bring p1 to l2_5.

29. Drive t2 to l2_1: drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2

    - a2 in l2_1
30. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_1: loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 
    - t1 in l1_1
    - p1 in t2
    - p2 in l2_5
    - t2 in l2_1 with p1 in it
    - a1 in l2_1

    - p1 in l2_5 (satisfying Constraint 8)
    - p2 in l2_5
    - t2 in l2_5
    - a1 in l2_1
    - a2 in l2_1
36. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_5: loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 
    - t1 in l1_1
    - p1 in t2
    - p2 in l2_5
    - t2 in l2_5 with p1 in it
    - a1 in l2_1
    - a2 in l2_1
37. Drive t2 to l2_4: drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2 
    - t1 in l1_1
    - p1 in t2
    - p2 in l2_5
    - t2 in l2_4 with p1 in it
    - a1 in l2_1
    - a2 in l2_1
38. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_4: unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 
    - t1 in l1_1
    - p1 in l2_4 (satisfying one goal)
    - p2 in l2_5
    - t2 in l2_4
    - a1 in l2_1
    - a2 in l2_1

Now, we need to get p2 back to l1_4 (goal).

39. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_5: loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 
    - t1 in l1_1
    - p1 in l2_4
    - p2 in t2
    - t2 in l2_5 with p2 in it
    - a1 in l2_1
    - a2 in l2_1
40. Drive t2 to l2_1: drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 
    - t1 in l1_1
    - p1 in l2_4
    - p2 in t2
    - t2 in l2_1 with p2 in it
    - a1 in l2_1
    - a2 in l2_1
41. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1: unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 
    - t1 in l1_1
    - p1 in l2_4
    - p2 in l2_1
    - t2 in l2_1
    - a1 in l2_1
    - a2 in l2_1
42. Load p2 onto a1 at l2_1: loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 
    - t1 in l1_1
    - p1 in l2_4
    - p2 in a1
    - t2 in l2_1
    - a1 in l2_1 with p2 in it
    - a2 in l2_1
43. Fly a1 to l1_1: flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1 
    - t1 in l1_1
    - p1 in l2_4
    - p2 in a1
    - t2 in l2_1
    - a1 in l1_1 with p2 in it
    - a2 in l2_1
44. Unload p2 from a1 at l1_1: unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 
    - t1 in l1_1
    - p1 in l2_4
    - p2 in l1_1
    - t2 in l2_1
    - a1 in l1_1
    - a2 in l2_1
45. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_1: loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 
    - t1 in l1_1 with p2 in it
    - p1 in l2_4
    - t2 in l2_1
    - a1 in l1_1
    - a2 in l2_1
46. Drive t1 to l1_4: drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1 
    - t1 in l1_4 with p2 in it
    - p1 in l2_4
    - t2 in l2_1
    - a1 in l1_1
    - a2 in l2_1
47. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_4: unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 
    - t1 in l1_4
    - p1 in l2_4
    - p2 in l1_4 (satisfying the other goal)
    - t2 in l2_1
    - a1 in l1_1
    - a2 in l2_1

Now, both goals are satisfied: p1 is in l2_4 and p2 is in l1_4.

Let me verify that all constraints are met:
1. p1 was in l2_1 (Constraint 1)
2. Before p1 was in l2_1, p2 was in l1_2 (Constraint 2)
3. p2 was in a2 (Constraint 3)
4. p1 was in l1_1 (Constraint 4)
5. After p1 was in l1_1, p2 was in l1_1 (Constraint 5)
6. p2 was in l2_5 (Constraint 6)
7. p2 was in t2 (one option for Constraint 7)
8. p1 was in l2_5 (Constraint 8)
9. p1 was in l2_3 (Constraint 9)

All constraints are met and the goal is achieved. So this is a valid plan.

Let me now outline the final plan sequentially, without the internal states, just the actions:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 
2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1 
3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 
4. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1 
5. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4 
6. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1 
7. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 
8. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 
9. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1 
10. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 
11. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 
12. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 
13. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 
14. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 
15. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 
16. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 
17. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1 
18. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 
19. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 
20. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 
21. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 
22. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 
23. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 
24. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 
25. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 
26. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2 
27. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 
28. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 
29. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 
30. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2 
31. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 
32. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 
33. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2 
34. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 
35. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 
36. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2 
37. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 
38. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2 
39. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 
40. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 
41. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 
42. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 
43. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1 
44. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 
45. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 
46. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1 
47. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 

I can optimize this plan by removing redundant steps. For example, step 16-18 seems inefficient: we load p2 onto t1, then unload it without moving the truck.

Let me reconsider and optimize the plan:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 
2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1 
3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 
4. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1 
5. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4 
6. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1 
7. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 
8. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 
9. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1 
10. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 
11. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 
12. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 
13. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 
14. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 
15. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 
16. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1 
17. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 
18. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 
19. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 
20. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 
21. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 
22. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 
23. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 
24. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2 
25. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 
26. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 
27. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 
28. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2 
29. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 
30. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 
31. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2 
32. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 
33. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 
34. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2 
35. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 
36. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2 
37. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 
38. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 
39. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 
40. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 
41. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1 
42. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 
43. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 
44. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1 
45. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 

I notice another redundancy in steps 20-21, where we load p2 onto a2 and then immediately unload it without moving a2. This is only to satisfy constraint 3, which states that "p2 must be in a2 at some point."

Also, there seems to be a redundancy in steps 29-30 where we unload p1 from t2 at l2_3 (satisfying Constraint 9) and then immediately load it back. We could optimize by just ensuring p1 is in l2_3 (Constraint 9) and l2_5 (Constraint 8) along the way to l2_4.

Let's finalizes the plan:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 
2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1 
3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 
4. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1 
5. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4 
6. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1 
7. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 
8. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 
9. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1 
10. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

25. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5

27. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 
28. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2

40. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

42. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 
43. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 
44. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1 
45. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
