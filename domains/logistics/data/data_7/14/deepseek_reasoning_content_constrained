Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. First, I need to understand the initial state, the goal, and the constraints. Let me start by listing everything out.

The goal is to have package p1 in l1_4 and p2 in l1_3. 

Initial state:
- p1 is in l1_3 (city c1)
- p2 is in l2_2 (city c2)
- Trucks t1 is in l1_3, t2 in l2_5
- Airplanes a1 in l1_1 (c1's airport), a2 in l2_1 (c2's airport)

Constraints are a bit complex. Let's list each one:

1. p2 must be in l1_4 at some state.
2. p1 must be in l2_4 or l2_2 at some state.
3. p2 must be in l1_1 at some state.
4. If p2 is in l1_1 (state s), then p2 must be in l1_2 in s or later.
5. p2 must be in l2_1 at some state.
6. If p2 is in l2_1 (state s), then in s or later, p2 is in l2_2 or p1 is in l2_2.
7. p1 must be in a1 at some state.
8. p2 must be in l1_3 (which is the goal, so that's covered, but maybe needs to occur before?)
Wait, the goal is p2 in l1_3, so that's part of the final state, but the constraint says it must hold in at least one state. So the final state satisfies this. However, there's another constraint: if p2 is in l1_3 in any state, then in an earlier state, p2 was in l2_3 or l2_5. Since initially p2 is in l2_2, so maybe we need to move it to l2_3 or l2_5 first.

9. p2 must be in l2_2 (which is initial, but maybe needs to be there again after moving?)
Wait, initial state has p2 in l2_2. But the constraint says "must hold in at least one state". So the initial state might satisfy that. However, if during the plan, p2 moves away and then back, that's another occurrence. But maybe we need to make sure that the constraint is met, possibly through another occurrence if the initial isn't sufficient. But since the problem requires the constraints to hold in the plan, the initial state might not be considered part of the plan's states. Wait, the plan's states include the initial state and each action's resulting states. So the initial state is part of the states. So if the initial state meets a constraint, then it's okay. For example, constraint 9: p2 in l2_2 is true in the initial state. So that's already satisfied. But the other constraints may require actions.

Let's process all constraints one by one.

Constraint 1: p2 must be in l1_4 at some point. l1_4 is in c1. Since p2 starts in c2, we need to get it to c1. To move between cities, we need airplanes. So p2 might need to be loaded onto an airplane in c2's airport (l2_1), flown to c1's airport (l1_1), then transported via truck.

Constraint 2: p1 must be in l2_4 or l2_2. Both are in c2. So p1 starts in c1, so we need to get p1 to c2. That requires airplane. So load p1 into a1, fly to l2_1, unload, then move via truck to l2_2 or l2_4. But the goal is p1 in l1_4 (back in c1). So this might involve moving p1 to c2 and back, which adds steps. But since the plan needs to be optimal (shortest possible), this could complicate things. But the constraints require this, so we have to include steps where p1 is in l2_2 or l2_4.

Constraint 3: p2 must be in l1_1 (c1's airport). So during transportation, perhaps when unloading from airplane.

Constraint 4: If p2 is in l1_1, then later it must be in l1_2. So after p2 is in l1_1 (airport), we need to move it to l1_2 via truck.

Constraint 5: p2 must be in l2_1 (c2's airport). So perhaps when loading into airplane a2 to fly to c1's airport, but wait, l2_1 is the airport in c2. So p2 is initially in l2_2. To get to l2_1, maybe use truck t2. Since t2 is in l2_5, but p2 is in l2_2. So first, drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2, load p2, then drive to l2_1 (since l2_1 is an airport in c2). But wait, can a truck move to the airport? Yes, because in the city. So c2 has locations l2_1 (airport), l2_2, etc. So t2 can drive from l2_2 to l2_1. So load p2 into t2 at l2_2, drive to l2_1, unload. Then load into airplane a2, fly to l1_1, unload, then drive to l1_4 via truck in c1. But also, constraint 1 requires p2 to be in l1_4. But the goal is p2 in l1_3. So after moving to l1_4, need to get it back to l1_3. Hmm, but that complicates. Wait, the goal is p1 in l1_4 and p2 in l1_3. So perhaps the plan needs to involve moving p2 to l1_4 first (satisfying constraint 1), then to l1_3. But how?

Let's outline steps for p2:

Initial: p2 in l2_2 (c2).

Need to get to l1_3 (c1). To do that, need to transport via airplane. So steps:

1. Move p2 to l2_1 (c2's airport) using truck t2.

But initially, t2 is in l2_5. So:

- Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2 (city c2). Action: drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2.

- Load p2 into t2 at l2_2: loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2.

- Drive t2 to l2_1: drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2.

- Unload p2 at l2_1: unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.

Now p2 is in l2_1. This satisfies constraint 5 (p2 in l2_1). Then, according to constraint 6: if p2 is in l2_1 in state s, then in s or later, p2 must be in l2_2 or p1 in l2_2. So after moving p2 to l2_1, we need to either move p2 to l2_2 (which is where it was initially) or have p1 in l2_2. But p1 starts in l1_3 (c1). So to get p1 to l2_2, we need to transport via airplane. But this seems like a lot. So perhaps after p2 is in l2_1, we load it onto airplane a2, fly to l1_1 (c1's airport), then unload. Then via truck to l1_4 (constraint 1), then to l1_3. But this may conflict with other constraints.

But constraint 6 says that if p2 is in l2_1 (which we do), then after that, either p2 is in l2_2 or p1 is in l2_2. So if we load p2 into a2 at l2_1 and fly to l1_1, then after that, p2 is in l1_1. But that doesn't satisfy the condition for constraint 6. So we need to ensure that after p2 is in l2_1, either p2 goes to l2_2 or p1 is in l2_2. So perhaps after moving p2 to l2_1, we need to move it to l2_2 again, or have p1 in l2_2.

But how can p1 get to l2_2? Let's think. p1 is initially in l1_3. To get to l2_2 (c2), we need to load it into a truck in c1, drive to l1_1 (airport), load into airplane a1, fly to l2_1 (c2's airport), unload, then load into a truck in c2, drive to l2_2. Then unload. But this would satisfy constraint 2 (p1 in l2_2). So maybe we can combine this.

But the problem is that the goal is to have p1 back in l1_4. So p1 would need to go from l1_3 to l2_2 (satisfying constraint 2), then back to c1. Which adds steps. But since the plan needs to be optimal, perhaps there's a way to do this efficiently.

Alternatively, perhaps after moving p2 to l2_1, we can fly p2 to l1_1, but then also have p1 transported to l2_2 via another airplane. But this might require more steps. Let's try to outline possible steps.

For p2:

- Move to l2_1 via truck t2 (as above).

For p1:

- Load p1 into truck t1 (which is in l1_3) at l1_3. Then drive to l1_1 (airport). Then load into airplane a1, fly to l2_1 (c2's airport). Unload, then load into truck in c2 (truck t2?) drive to l2_2. But t2 is in l2_1 after moving p2. So after unloading p2 at l2_1, we can use t2 again.

But this is getting complicated. Let's see.

But let's note that the goal for p2 is l1_3 (c1). So p2 needs to be moved from c2 to c1. The steps for p2 would be:

1. In c2: move from l2_2 to l2_1 (airport) via truck.

2. Load into airplane a2 at l2_1.

3. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1 (c1's airport).

4. Unload p2 at l1_1.

5. Then, use truck t1 (initially in l1_3) to drive to l1_1, load p2, drive to l1_4 (constraint 1), unload, then drive to l1_3 (goal). But t1 is in l1_3 initially. So steps for t1:

- Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1 (if needed). Wait, but l1_1 is in c1, and t1 is a truck in c1.

But the initial state says "Package t1 is in location l1_3". Wait, no. Wait, the initial state lists:

"Package t1 is in location l1_3"

Wait, but t1 is a truck. Trucks can't be packages. Wait, the problem statement says:

The world includes the following objects:

"truck t1"

"truck t2"

So the initial state says:

"Package t1 is in location l1_3"

Wait, that's a mistake. Because t1 is a truck, not a package. This must be a typo. Looking back:

Original initial state:

The original state of the world is the following:

... 

"Package t1 is in location l1_3"

"Package t2 is in location l2_5"

"Package p1 is in location l1_3"

"Package p2 is in location l2_2"

"Package a1 is in location l1_1"

"Package a2 is in location l2_1"

Wait, that's impossible. Because trucks and airplanes are not packages. So this must be a mistake. The correct initial state is probably:

Truck t1 is in l1_3.

Truck t2 is in l2_5.

Airplane a1 is in l1_1.

Airplane a2 is in l2_1.

Packages p1 and p2 are in their respective locations.

So the user probably made a mistake in the initial state description. For example, "Package t1 is in location l1_3" should be "Truck t1 is in location l1_3". Similarly for a1 and a2.

Assuming that's the case, because otherwise, the problem is impossible. Because trucks and airplanes can't be packages. So I'll proceed under that assumption.

So initial state corrected:

Truck t1 is in l1_3 (c1).

Truck t2 is in l2_5 (c2).

Airplane a1 is in l1_1 (c1's airport).

Airplane a2 is in l2_1 (c2's airport).

Packages:

p1 in l1_3 (c1).

p2 in l2_2 (c2).

Okay, that makes sense.

Now, back to the plan.

First, let's handle p2's movement to l1_3 (goal), while satisfying constraints.

Constraints for p2:

- Must be in l1_4 at some state (constraint 1).

- Must be in l1_1 (constraint 3), and then later in l1_2 (constraint 4).

- Must be in l2_1 (constraint 5), and after that, either p2 in l2_2 or p1 in l2_2 (constraint 6).

Also, when p2 is in l1_3 (final state), there must be an earlier state where p2 is in l2_3 or l2_5 (constraint 8). Initially, p2 is in l2_2, so we need to move it to l2_3 or l2_5 first.

Wait, that's another key constraint. So to satisfy constraint 8: before p2 is in l1_3, it must have been in l2_3 or l2_5. So we need to move p2 from l2_2 to either l2_3 or l2_5, then later to l1_3. But how?

For example, moving p2 from l2_2 to l2_5 (using truck t2 which is in l2_5 initially?), but wait, t2 is in l2_5. To load p2 into t2, p2 must be in the same location as t2. But p2 is initially in l2_2. So we need to drive t2 to l2_2, load p2, then drive to l2_5. Then unload. Then maybe drive back to l2_1 to load into airplane. But this would satisfy constraint 8 (since p2 is in l2_5).

Alternatively, move p2 to l2_3. Let's see.

So for constraint 8, we need to move p2 to l2_3 or l2_5 before it gets to l1_3.

Let me outline possible steps for p2:

Option 1:

1. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2 (c2).

2. Load p2 into t2 at l2_2.

3. Drive t2 to l2_5 (original location). Unload p2. Now p2 is in l2_5. This satisfies constraint 8 (p2 in l2_5).

4. Then, drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (airport in c2).

5. Load p2 into t2 again (if needed) and drive to l2_1. Wait, no, after step 3, p2 is in l2_5. So to move p2 to l2_1, need to load into t2 again (since t2 is in l2_5 after step 3).

Wait, after step 3: t2 is in l2_5 (after driving to l2_5), and p2 is unloaded there. So to move p2 to l2_1, we need to load it back into t2.

So:

4. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5.

5. Drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2.

6. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1. Now p2 is in l2_1, which satisfies constraint 5. Then, according to constraint 6, after this state, we need p2 in l2_2 or p1 in l2_2.

But p1 is in c1. So perhaps after this, we fly p2 to c1's airport, but need to ensure that constraint 6 is satisfied. Let's see.

If after unloading p2 at l2_1 (step 6), we load it into airplane a2 (which is at l2_1) and fly to l1_1. Then unload p2 at l1_1. That would satisfy constraint 3 (p2 in l1_1). Then according to constraint 4, after that, p2 must go to l1_2.

But how?

So steps continue:

7. Loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1.

8. Flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

9. Unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1. Now p2 is in l1_1.

Now, constraint 3 is satisfied (p2 in l1_1). Then, per constraint 4, we need p2 in l1_2 after that.

So:

10. Load p2 into a truck in c1. Which truck? t1 is in l1_3. Need to drive t1 to l1_1.

So:

10. Drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1.

11. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

12. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1.

13. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2. Now p2 is in l1_2 (satisfies constraint 4's requirement).

Then, from l1_2, drive to l1_4 (constraint 1), then to l1_3 (goal).

So:

14. Drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1.

15. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4. Now constraint 1 is satisfied.

Then, drive to l1_3:

16. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1.

17. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3. Now p2 is in goal.

But wait, this is a lot of steps, and we need to also handle p1's movement to l2_2 or l2_4 (constraint 2), and other constraints.

Let's check for constraint 2: p1 must be in l2_2 or l2_4. So p1 starts in l1_3. To get to c2, need to use airplane. So:

Possible steps for p1:

1. Load p1 into t1 at l1_3.

2. Drive t1 to l1_1 (airport).

3. Load into airplane a1.

4. Fly to l2_1 (c2's airport).

5. Unload p1 at l2_1.

6. Load into truck t2 (which is in l2_1 after moving p2 steps).

7. Drive to l2_2 or l2_4.

For example, drive to l2_2:

8. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2.

9. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2. Now p1 is in l2_2, satisfying constraint 2.

But then, to get p1 back to c1 for the goal (p1 in l1_4), we need to reverse the steps.

So:

10. Load p1 into t2 at l2_2.

11. Drive to l2_1.

12. Load into airplane a1.

13. Fly to l1_1.

14. Unload p1.

15. Load into t1, drive to l1_4.

This adds a lot of steps. But since the plan must be optimal (shortest possible), this seems too long. Maybe there's a way to combine the steps for p1 and p2.

Alternatively, perhaps p1 can be moved to l2_2 and then brought back, but this would require multiple flights. Let's see.

But let's also consider constraint 7: p1 must be in a1 at some state. So during the process of flying p1 to c2, when it's loaded into a1, that satisfies constraint 7.

So maybe we can do the following steps:

For p1:

1. Load p1 into t1 at l1_3.

2. Drive t1 to l1_1.

3. Load into a1 (so p1 is in a1, satisfying constraint7).

4. Fly a1 to l2_1.

5. Unload p1 into l2_1.

6. Load p1 into t2 (which is in l2_1 after moving p2 steps).

7. Drive to l2_2 (satisfies constraint 2).

8. Unload p1 in l2_2.

But then, to get p1 back to c1 for the goal:

9. Load p1 into t2.

10. Drive back to l2_1.

11. Load into a1.

12. Fly to l1_1.

13. Unload p1.

14. Load into t1.

15. Drive to l1_4 (goal).

But this is a lot. Let's see how this can be optimized.

But perhaps we can combine steps. For example, while p2 is being moved, p1 can be moved.

Alternatively, perhaps after moving p2 to l1_4 (constraint 1), then move it to l1_3. But how does that interact with other constraints.

Wait, let's try to outline the entire plan step by step, considering all constraints.

First, handle constraint 8: p2 must have been in l2_3 or l2_5 before reaching l1_3. Since p2 starts in l2_2, we need to move it to one of those. Let's move it to l2_5 using truck t2.

Steps:

1. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2 (c2). (drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2)

2. Load p2 into t2. (loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2)

3. Drive t2 to l2_5. (drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2)

4. Unload p2. (unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5) → Now p2 is in l2_5 (satisfies constraint 8's earlier state)

Now, to move p2 to c1:

5. Load p2 into t2 again. (loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5)

6. Drive t2 to l2_1 (airport). (drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2)

7. Unload p2 at l2_1. (unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1) → Now p2 is in l2_1 (satisfies constraint 5)

Constraint 6: after this, p2 must go to l2_2 or p1 to l2_2. Let's choose to move p2 to l2_2, but how? Since p2 is in l2_1, we can load into t2 again:

8. Load p2 into t2. (loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1)

9. Drive t2 to l2_2. (drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2)

10. Unload p2. (unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2) → Now p2 is back in l2_2. But then we have to move it again. But this seems redundant. Alternatively, maybe after step 7 (p2 in l2_1), we can fly p2 to l1_1, but then ensure that after step 7, p1 is moved to l2_2. But p1 is in c1. So maybe this is a better path:

After step 7 (p2 in l2_1), we load p2 into airplane a2 and fly to l1_1. But according to constraint 6, after p2 is in l2_1, in s or later, p2 must be in l2_2 or p1 in l2_2. If we fly p2 to l1_1, then p2 is no longer in c2, so the only way to satisfy constraint 6 is to have p1 in l2_2 at some point after p2 is in l2_1.

So let's handle that.

So after step 7 (p2 in l2_1), we need to get p1 to l2_2. Let's start moving p1.

Steps for p1:

11. Load p1 into t1 at l1_3. (loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3)

12. Drive t1 to l1_1. (drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1)

13. Load p1 into a1. (loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1) → satisfies constraint7

14. Fly a1 to l2_1. (flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1)

15. Unload p1 from a1. (unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1)

16. Load p1 into t2 (which is in l2_1 after step 6). (loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1)

17. Drive t2 to l2_2. (drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2)

18. Unload p1. (unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2) → p1 in l2_2 (satisfies constraint 2)

Now, after step 18, constraint 6 is satisfied because p1 is in l2_2 after p2 was in l2_1 (step7). So constraint6 is satisfied.

Now, need to get p1 back to c1. Since the goal is p1 in l1_4.

Steps for p1:

19. Load p1 into t2. (loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2)

20. Drive t2 to l2_1. (drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2)

21. Unload p1. (unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1)

22. Load p1 into a1. (loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1)

23. Fly a1 to l1_1. (flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1)

24. Unload p1. (unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1)

25. Load p1 into t1 (which is at l1_1 from step12). (loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1)

26. Drive t1 to l1_4. (drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1)

27. Unload p1. (unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4) → satisfies the goal for p1.

Now, p2 is still in l2_2 (step10). But we need to move p2 to l1_3. So let's continue the steps for p2.

But wait, after step10, p2 is in l2_2. Then steps 11-27 handle p1. So p2 is still in l2_2. To move p2 to l1_3, we need to transport it via airplane again.

So steps for p2:

29. Load p2 into t2 at l2_2. (loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2)

30. Drive t2 to l2_1. (drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2)

31. Unload p2. (unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1)

32. Load p2 into a2. (loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1)

33. Fly a2 to l1_1. (flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1)

34. Unload p2. (unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1) → Now p2 is in l1_1 (satisfies constraint3)

Now, per constraint4: after p2 is in l1_1, it must go to l1_2. So:

35. Load p2 into t1 (which is in l1_4 after step26? Wait, no. After step26, t1 is in l1_4. So to load p2 into t1, t1 needs to be in l1_1.

But after step12, t1 was in l1_1. Then step25: load p1 into t1 (step25 is after step24, which is after step23: a1 flies back to l1_1. So after step24, p1 is unloaded into l1_1. Then step25 loads p1 into t1. Then step26 drives to l1_4. So after step26, t1 is in l1_4.

So to move p2 from l1_1 to l1_2, need to use t1 or another truck. But t1 is in l1_4. So:

35. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1.

36. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

37. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1.

38. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2. → satisfies constraint4.

Then, to get p2 to l1_4 (constraint1):

39. Drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1.

40. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4. → satisfies constraint1.

Finally, move p2 to l1_3 (goal):

41. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1.

42. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3. → goal achieved.

This is very long. But we need to check if all constraints are met.

Constraints:

1. p2 in l1_4: step40.

2. p1 in l2_2: step18.

3. p2 in l1_1: step34.

4. After p2 in l1_1 (step34), p2 moves to l1_2 (step38).

5. p2 in l2_1: step7.

6. After p2 in l2_1 (step7), p1 is moved to l2_2 (step18).

7. p1 in a1: step13.

8. For p2 in l1_3 (final step42), earlier state has p2 in l2_5 (step4).

9. p2 in l2_2: initial and step10, which is satisfied.

10. If p2 in l2_2 (step10), then after that, either p1 in l2_3 or p2 in l2_4. But after step10, p2 is in l2_2, and in step18, p1 is in l2_2, but then we move p1 to l2_2, but the constraint says that if p2 is in l2_2 at any state s, then after s, either p1 in l2_3 or p2 in l2_4. Hmm, need to check.

Constraint 10: If p2 is in l2_2 (any state s), then in s or after, p1 in l2_3 or p2 in l2_4.

In our plan, p2 is in l2_2 at step10. After that, steps 11-18 move p1 to l2_2. So during step18, p1 is in l2_2. Does this satisfy the constraint? The constraint requires that after s (step10), either p1 is in l2_3 or p2 is in l2_4. But in our case, after step10, p1 is moved to l2_2, which doesn't meet either condition. So this violates constraint10.

Oh no, this is a problem. So the plan as outlined doesn't satisfy constraint10. Because after step10 (p2 in l2_2), we need to have either p1 in l2_3 or p2 in l2_4 at some state after step10.

But in our current plan, after step10, we have p1 moving to l2_2 (step18), which doesn't help. So we need to adjust the plan to satisfy constraint10.

This means that whenever p2 is in l2_2 (step10, and possibly other times), we need to ensure that after that state, either p1 is in l2_3 or p2 is in l2_4.

So after step10, we need to either move p2 to l2_4 or move p1 to l2_3.

But how?

After step10, p2 is in l2_2. Steps 11-18 move p1 to l2_2, but that doesn't help. So perhaps after step10, we need to move p2 to l2_4.

So after step10 (p2 in l2_2), add:

10a. Load p2 into t2.

10b. Drive t2 to l2_4.

10c. Unload p2. Now p2 is in l2_4. This would satisfy constraint10.

But then we need to move p2 from l2_4 back to l2_1 to fly to c1. This adds steps.

Alternatively, after step10, move p1 to l2_3.

But p1 is in c1. So how?

This is getting very complicated. Let's think of a different approach.

Alternative plan:

Instead of moving p2 to l2_5 first, move it to l2_3 to satisfy constraint8.

But p2 is initially in l2_2. To move to l2_3:

1. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2. (drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2)

2. Load p2 into t2. (loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2)

3. Drive to l2_3. (drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2)

4. Unload p2. → Now p2 in l2_3 (satisfies constraint8)

Then, move p2 to l2_1:

5. Load p2 into t2. (loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3)

6. Drive to l2_1. (drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2)

7. Unload p2. → p2 in l2_1 (constraint5)

Now, per constraint6, after p2 in l2_1, need p2 in l2_2 or p1 in l2_2.

If we then fly p2 to l1_1, but need to handle constraint6. So perhaps after step7, load p2 into airplane a2 and fly to l1_1. Then, after that, we need to ensure p1 is in l2_2. But that would require moving p1.

But this approach might require fewer steps. Let's proceed.

Steps for p2:

1. Drive t2 to l2_2.

2. Load p2.

3. Drive to l2_3.

4. Unload.

5. Load again, drive to l2_1.

6. Unload.

7. Load into a2, fly to l1_1.

8. Unload.

9. Load into truck t1, drive to l1_4 (constraint1), then to l1_3.

But also need to handle p1's movement to l2_2 or l2_4.

But this might not address all constraints. Let's think.

But this plan is getting too long. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Alternative idea: use the airplane a1 to move p1 to l2_2, satisfy constraint2 and6, and then return.

But let's outline:

Steps for p1:

1. Load p1 into t1 at l1_3.

2. Drive to l1_1.

3. Load into a1.

4. Fly to l2_1.

5. Unload.

6. Load into t2.

7. Drive to l2_2.

8. Unload. → p1 in l2_2 (constraint2).

Then, to satisfy constraint10: when p2 is in l2_2 (which is initial), after that, either p1 in l2_3 or p2 in l2_4.

But initially, p2 is in l2_2, so after initial state, the first action is to move p2 to l2_3 or l2_4.

Wait, the initial state has p2 in l2_2, which triggers constraint10. So in the initial state, p2 is in l2_2. According to constraint10, if that's the case, then in some state after, p1 must be in l2_3 or p2 in l2_4.

But the initial state is before any actions. So the first action must lead to a state where p1 is in l2_3 or p2 in l2_4.

But how?

This complicates things. So, after the initial state, we need to either move p2 to l2_4 or move p1 to l2_3.

But p1 starts in l1_3, so moving to l2_3 requires airplane.

So perhaps the first steps should be moving p2 to l2_4.

So:

1. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2. (drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2)

2. Load p2 into t2.

3. Drive to l2_4.

4. Unload p2. → p2 in l2_4 (satisfies constraint10 for the initial state's p2 in l2_2, since after that, p2 is in l2_4).

Then proceed to move p2 to l2_1.

But this approach might be better.

So let's try this:

Steps for p2:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2.

2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2.

3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2. (moves p2 to l2_4, satisfying constraint10 for the initial state's p2 in l2_2)

4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4. → p2 in l2_4.

5. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4.

6. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2.

7. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1. → p2 in l2_1 (constraint5).

Then, per constraint6, after this, need p2 in l2_2 or p1 in l2_2.

Let's choose to move p2 to l2_2:

8. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.

9. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2.

10. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2. → p2 back in l2_2.

But now, this triggers constraint10 again. So after step10, we need to move p2 to l2_4 or p1 to l2_3.

But this seems like a loop. So perhaps instead, after step7 (p2 in l2_1), we fly p2 to c1's airport and handle other constraints, while also moving p1 to l2_2.

This is getting very complex. Given the time constraints, perhaps the best way is to outline a plan that satisfies all the constraints step by step, even if it's longer, but ensuring all are met.

But since the user requires an optimal plan (shortest possible), I need to find the minimal steps.

Alternative plan combining steps:

For p2:

- Move from l2_2 to l2_5 (to satisfy constraint8).

- Move to l2_1, fly to l1_1.

- Then move to l1_4 (constraint1), then to l1_3.

For p1:

- Move to l2_2 (via airplane) to satisfy constraints2 and6.

- Then return to c1.

But let's try to outline this:

Steps:

1. Move p2 to l2_5:

   a. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2.

   b. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2.

   c. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2.

   d. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5. → constraint8 satisfied.

2. Move p2 to l2_1:

   e. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5.

   f. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2.

   g. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1. → constraint5 satisfied.

3. Fly p2 to l1_1:

   h. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1.

   i. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

   j. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1. → constraint3 satisfied.

4. Move p2 to l1_2 to satisfy constraint4:

   k. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1. (move t1 to l1_1)

   l. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

   m. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1.

   n. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2. → constraint4 satisfied.

5. Move p2 to l1_4 (constraint1):

   o. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1.

   p. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4. → constraint1 satisfied.

6. Move p2 to l1_3 (goal):

   q. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1.

   r. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3. → p2 goal achieved.

Now, handle p1's movement to l2_2:

7. Move p1 to l2_2:

   s. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1. (t1 is now in l1_1 after step k, but after step q, t1 is in l1_3 again. Wait, steps k to r involve t1 moving from l1_3 to l1_1, then l1_2, l1_4, l1_3. So after step r, t1 is in l1_3. So to move p1, need to use t1 again.)

   s. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3.

   t. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1.

   u. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1. → constraint7 satisfied.

   v. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1.

   w. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1.

   x. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1.

   y. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2.

   z. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2. → constraint2 satisfied.

Now, per constraint6: after p2 was in l2_1 (stepg), we have p1 in l2_2 (stepz), which satisfies it.

Then, move p1 back to c1:

A. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2.

B. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2.

C. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1.

D. loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1.

E. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1.

F. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1.

G. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1.

H. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1.

I. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4. → p1 goal achieved.

Now, check constraints:

- Constraint1: step p.

- Constraint2: step z.

- Constraint3: step j.

- Constraint4: step n, then step o moves p2 to l1_4.

- Constraint5: stepg.

- Constraint6: after stepg, p1 is in l2_2 (stepz), which is after.

- Constraint7: stepu.

- Constraint8: stepd.

- Constraint9: p2 was in l2_2 initially, but in step z, p1 is in l2_2. However, the constraint9 requires p2 in l2_2 at some state. The initial state satisfies that, so it's okay.

- Constraint10: when p2 was in l2_2 (initial state), we moved it to l2_5 (stepd), so after that, in stepd, p2 is in l2_5, which is not l2_4 or p1 in l2_3. Wait, no. The initial state has p2 in l2_2, and constraint10 requires that if p2 is in l2_2 in any state s, then after s, p2 is in l2_4 or p1 in l2_3. In our plan, after the initial state (s), we move p2 to l2_5. That doesn't satisfy either condition. So this violates constraint10.

Ah, so this approach also fails constraint10. Because after the initial state (s0), p2 is in l2_2. So according to constraint10, in s0 or after, there must be a state where p2 is in l2_4 or p1 in l2_3. But in our plan, the first action moves p2 to l2_5, which is neither. So the initial state's p2 in l2_2 triggers constraint10, which requires that after that, p2 is moved to l2_4 or p1 to l2_3. But our plan moves p2 to l2_5, which doesn't satisfy this.

So, to satisfy constraint10 for the initial state, we must first move p2 from l2_2 to l2_4 or move p1 to l2_3 before any other steps.

But how can we move p1 to l2_3? It starts in c1. So:

1. Load p1 into t1, drive to l1_1, load into a1, fly to l2_1, unload, load into t2, drive to l2_3, unload.

But this would take many steps, but necessary to satisfy constraint10.

So initial steps must address this.

Let's try:

Step1: Move p1 to l2_3.

Steps:

1. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3.

2. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1.

3. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1.

4. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1.

5. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1.

6. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1.

7. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2.

8. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3. → p1 in l2_3, satisfying constraint10 for the initial state's p2 in l2_2.

Now, after step8, p1 is in l2_3. So constraint10 is satisfied for the initial state's p2 in l2_2.

But we also need to handle other constraints.

Now, proceed to move p2 to l2_5 for constraint8.

Steps for p2:

9. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2. (since p2 is in l2_2 initially)

Wait, p2 is still in l2_2. So:

9. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2. (but t2 is in l2_3 after step7. So need to move t2 back.)

Wait, after step7, t2 is in l2_3. To load p2 from l2_2, t2 needs to be there.

So:

9. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2.

10. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2.

11. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2.

12. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5. → constraint8 satisfied.

Then move p2 to l2_1:

13. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5.

14. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2.

15. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1. → constraint5 satisfied.

Now, per constraint6, after p2 is in l2_1, need p2 in l2_2 or p1 in l2_2. Currently, p1 is in l2_3. So if we move p2 to l2_2:

16. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.

17. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2.

18. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2. → p2 in l2_2.

But this triggers constraint10 again. So after step18, we need p2 in l2_4 or p1 in l2_3. p1 is in l2_3 (step8), which satisfies it.

So that's okay.

Now, fly p2 to l1_1:

19. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2.

20. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2.

21. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.

22. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1.

23. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

24. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1. → constraint3 satisfied.

Move p2 to l1_2:

25. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1.

26. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

27. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1.

28. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2. → constraint4 satisfied.

Move p2 to l1_4:

29. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1.

30. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4. → constraint1 satisfied.

Move p2 to l1_3:

31. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1.

32. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3. → p2 goal.

Move p1 back to c1:

p1 is in l2_3.

33. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3.

34. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2.

35. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1.

36. loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1.

37. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1.

38. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1.

39. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1.

40. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1.

41. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4. → p1 goal.

But this plan is extremely long. However, it satisfies all constraints. But the user wants an optimal (shortest) plan. It's possible that this is the shortest possible given the constraints, but maybe there's a smarter way.

Alternative approach: combine steps where possible.

For example, when moving p1 to l2_3, use the same truck t2 to move p2.

But I'm not sure. This is getting too time-consuming, and perhaps this is the best possible plan given the constraints. However, given the time, I'll proceed to write the final answer with a plan that meets all constraints, even if it's long.
