Alright, I'm given a planning problem where we need to move packages to specific locations. Let's start by understanding the initial state.

From the initial state, I see that:
- Locations l1_1, l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5 are in city c1
- Locations l2_1, l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5 are in city c2
- l1_1 and l2_1 are airports
- t1 (a truck) is in location l1_3
- t2 (a truck) is in location l2_5
- p1 (a package) is in location l1_3
- p2 (a package) is in location l2_2
- a1 (an airplane) is in location l1_1
- a2 (an airplane) is in location l2_1

The goal is to bring about:
- p1 is in location l1_4
- p2 is in location l1_3

Now, let's understand the constraints:

1. p2 must be in l1_4 at some point.
2. p1 must be in either l2_4 or l2_2 at some point.
3. p2 must be in l1_1 at some point.
4. If p2 is in l1_1, then p2 must eventually be in l1_2.
5. p2 must be in l2_1 at some point.
6. If p2 is in l2_1, then either p2 or p1 must eventually be in l2_2.
7. p1 must be in a1 (airplane) at some point.
8. p2 must be in l1_3 at some point.
9. If p2 is in l1_3, then there must have been a previous state where p2 was in either l2_3 or l2_5.
10. p2 must be in l2_2 at some point.
11. If p2 is in l2_2, then either p1 must be in l2_3 or p2 must be in l2_4 at the same time or later.

Let's start by checking the initial state of p2:
- p2 is in l2_2 (satisfying constraint 10)

Given constraint 11, if p2 is in l2_2, then either p1 must be in l2_3 or p2 must be in l2_4 at the same time or later. Since p1 is in l1_3 initially, we need to either move p2 to l2_4 or move p1 to l2_3. 

Let's consider a general approach:

1. We need to move p1 from l1_3 to l1_4 eventually.
2. We need to move p2 from l2_2 to l1_3 eventually.
3. Along the way, we need to satisfy all the constraints.

Let's start by planning the movement of p2:

1. p2 is in l2_2
2. We load p2 into truck t2 (which is in l2_5, but we'll first need to move t2 to l2_2).
3. drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (airport)
4. unload p2 from t2 in l2_1 (satisfying constraint 5)
   - Due to constraint 6, either p2 must go back to l2_2 or p1 must go to l2_2.
5. load p2 into airplane a2 (in l2_1)
6. fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1
7. unload p2 from a2 in l1_1 (satisfying constraint 3)
   - Due to constraint 4, p2 must go to l1_2.
8. load p2 into truck t1 (which we need to move to l1_1)
9. drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_2
10. unload p2 from t1 in l1_2 (satisfying constraint 4)
11. load p2 back into t1
12. drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_4
13. unload p2 from t1 in l1_4 (satisfying constraint 1)
14. load p2 back into t1
15. drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_3
16. unload p2 from t1 in l1_3 (satisfying constraint 8 and also the goal)

For p1:

1. p1 is in l1_3
2. We load p1 into truck t1 (which is already in l1_3)
3. drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1 (airport)
4. unload p1 from t1 in l1_1
5. load p1 into airplane a1 (satisfying constraint 7)
6. fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1
7. unload p1 from a1 in l2_1
8. load p1 into truck t2
9. drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2 (satisfying constraints 2 and 6)
10. drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_3 (satisfying constraint 11)
11. unload p1 from t2 in l2_3
12. load p1 back into t2
13. drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1
14. unload p1 from t2 in l2_1
15. load p1 into airplane a2
16. fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1
17. unload p1 from a2 in l1_1
18. load p1 into truck t1
19. drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_4
20. unload p1 from t1 in l1_4 (satisfying the goal)

This is just a rough plan, and there might be more efficient ways to satisfy all the constraints. Let's revise and optimize this plan:

Wait, I think my plan was missing a crucial step. Actually, we need to first check if the initial state already satisfies any of the constraints.
- p2 is in l2_2 (satisfying constraint 10)
But also constraint 11 says that if p2 is in l2_2, then either p1 must be in l2_3 or p2 must be in l2_4 at the same time or later. Since p1 is not in l2_3 initially, we need to move p2 to l2_4.

Actually, let's replan this more carefully, considering all the constraints and their temporal relationships:

SUMMARY OF CONSTRAINTS:
1. p2 must be in l1_4 at some point.
2. p1 must be in either l2_4 or l2_2 at some point.
3. p2 must be in l1_1 at some point.
4. If p2 is in l1_1, then p2 must eventually be in l1_2.
5. p2 must be in l2_1 at some point.
6. If p2 is in l2_1, then either p2 or p1 must eventually be in l2_2.
7. p1 must be in a1 (airplane) at some point.
8. p2 must be in l1_3 at some point.
9. If p2 is in l1_3, then there must have been a previous state where p2 was in either l2_3 or l2_5.
10. p2 must be in l2_2 at some point.
11. If p2 is in l2_2, then either p1 must be in l2_3 or p2 must be in l2_4 at the same time or later.

Let's start planning:

- p2 is initially in l2_2, satisfying constraint 10.
- Due to constraint 11, we need to either move p2 to l2_4 or move p1 to l2_3.
- p1 is initially in l1_3, so we could move it to l2_3 to satisfy constraint 11.
- Due to constraint 2, p1 must be in either l2_4 or l2_2.
- Due to constraint 9, before p2 can go to l1_3, it must have been either in l2_3 or l2_5.
- Due to constraint 7, p1 must be in a1 at some point.

In this case, I think we would want to first move p2 to l2_4 to satisfy constraint 11, then to l2_5 (to satisfy constraint 9 for the future), then through l2_1 (to satisfy 5) to l1_1 (to satisfy 3), then to l1_2 (to satisfy 4), then to l1_4 (to satisfy 1), and finally to l1_3 (to satisfy 8 and the goal).

Additionally, for p1, we need to move it from l1_3 to either l2_4 or l2_2 (to satisfy constraint 2), and it must be in a1 at some point (constraint 7), and it has a goal of being in l1_4.

Let's create an optimal plan to satisfy all these constraints:

Initial state:
- t1 is in l1_3
- t2 is in l2_5
- p1 is in l1_3
- p2 is in l2_2
- a1 is in l1_1
- a2 is in l2_1

Plan:

1. First, let's move truck t2 from l2_5 to l2_2 to pick up p2:
   - drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
   - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

2. Now, let's move p2 to l2_4 (to satisfy constraint 11):
   - drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2
   - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
   - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

3. Now, let's move p2 to l2_5 (to satisfy constraint 9 for the future):
   - drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2
   - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
   - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5

4. Now, let's move p2 to l2_1 (to satisfy constraint 5):
   - drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
   - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

5. Due to constraint 6, since p2 is in l2_1, either p2 or p1 must be in l2_2. Let's move p2 back to l2_2 (this gives us a cleaner solution):
   - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
   - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
   - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
   - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

6. Now, let's load p2 onto the airplane a2 in l2_1:
   - drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
   - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
   - loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

7. Let's fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1:
   - flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
   - unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (satisfying constraint 3)

8. Due to constraint 4, since p2 is in l1_1, it must be in l1_2 afterwards. Let's use truck t1 to move p2 to l1_2:
   - drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
   - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
   - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (satisfying constraint 4)
   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

9. Next, let's take p2 to l1_4 (to satisfy constraint 1):
   - drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1
   - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (satisfying constraint 1)
   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

10. Finally, let's move p2 to l1_3 (satisfying constraint 8 and one of the goals):
   - drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1
   - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (satisfying constraint 8 and one of the goals)

Now, let's handle p1:

11. First, let's pick up p1 from l1_3 (during the beginning of the scenario):
   - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3

12. Let's drive t1 to l1_1 to load p1 into a1:
   - drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
   - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
   - loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (satisfying constraint 7)

13. Let's fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1:
   - flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
   - unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

14. Let's use truck t2 to move p1 to l2_2 (to satisfy constraint 2 and 6):
   - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
   - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
   - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (satisfying constraint 2 and 6)
   - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

15. Let's move p1 to l2_3 (to satisfy constraint 11):
   - drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
   - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (satisfying constraint 11)
   - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

16. Let's drive t2 to l2_1 to load p1 into a2:
   - drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
   - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
   - loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

17. Let's fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1:
   - flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
   - unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

18. Let's use truck t1 to move p1 to l1_4 (to satisfy the goal):
   - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
   - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
   - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4 (satisfying the goal)

Hmm, I think there are issues with this plan because I'm having trouble keeping track of where things are. Let's try to make a more streamlined plan:

OK, looking back at the problem, I misudnerstood what "package t1" and "package t2" meant. t1 and t2 are trucks, not packages. Let me revisit the problem with a clearer mind:

Initial state:
- Locations l1_1, l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5 are in city c1
- Locations l2_1, l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5 are in city c2
- l1_1 and l2_1 are airports
- Truck t1 is in location l1_3
- Truck t2 is in location l2_5
- Package p1 is in location l1_3
- Package p2 is in location l2_2
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

So we have 2 packages, 2 trucks, and 2 airplanes. Our goal is to have:
- p1 in l1_4
- p2 in l1_3

I also messed up the constraints. Let me be more careful about understanding the constraints (I've made notes for clairty after each constraint):

1. p2 must be in l1_4 at some point.
   (p2 must pass through l1_4, so we need to plan a route for p2 that includes l1_4)
2. p1 must be in either l2_4 or l2_2 at some point.
   (p1 must pass through either l2_4 or l2_2, so we need to plan a route for p1 that includes one of these locations)
3. p2 must be in l1_1 at some point.
   (p2 must pass through l1_1, so we need to plan a route for p2 that includes l1_1)
4. If p2 is in l1_1, then p2 must eventually be in l1_2.
   (after p2 is in l1_1, it must go to l1_2)
5. p2 must be in l2_1 at some point.
   (p2 must pass through l2_1, so we need to plan a route for p2 that includes l2_1)
6. If p2 is in l2_1, then either p2 or p1 must eventually be in l2_2.
   (after p2 is in l2_1, either p2 or p1 must go to l2_2)
7. p1 must be in a1 (airplane) at some point.
   (p1 must be loaded onto a1 at some point)
8. p2 must be in l1_3 at some point.
   (p2 must pass through l1_3, which is also its final goal)
9. If p2 is in l1_3, then there must have been a previous state where p2 was in either l2_3 or l2_5.
   (before p2 can be in l1_3, it must have been in either l2_3 or l2_5)
10. p2 must be in l2_2 at some point.
   (p2 must pass through l2_2, which is also its initial location)
11. If p2 is in l2_2, then either p1 must be in l2_3 or p2 must be in l2_4 at the same time or later.
   (after p2 is in l2_2, either p1 must be in l2_3 or p2 must be in l2_4)

Alright, let's plan the movement of each package through the required locations.

For p2 (initially in l2_2):
- p2 is in l2_2 (satisfying constraint 10)
- Due to constraint 11, after p2 is in l2_2, either p1 must be in l2_3 or p2 must be in l2_4. Let's opt for the latter.
- So, we need to move p2 from l2_2 to l2_4.
- Next, due to constraint 9, before p2 can be in l1_3, it must have been in either l2_3 or l2_5. Let's opt for the latter.
- So, we need to move p2 from l2_4 to l2_5.
- p2 must be in l2_1 (constraint 5) and l1_1 (constraint 3).
- If p2 is in l2_1, then either p2 or p1 must be in l2_2 (constraint 6). p2 already is in l2_2 at the beginning, so this constraint is already satisfied.
- If p2 is in l1_1, then p2 must be in l1_2 (constraint 4).
- p2 must be in l1_4 (constraint 1) and l1_3 (constraint 8 and goal).

So, a plan for p2 would be: l2_2 -> l2_4 -> l2_5 -> l2_1 -> l1_1 -> l1_2 -> l1_4 -> l1_3. This satisfies all the constraints related to p2.

For p1 (initially in l1_3):
- p1 must be in either l2_4 or l2_2 (constraint 2).
- p1 must be in a1 (constraint 7).
- p1 must end up in l1_4 (goal).

So, a plan for p1 would be: l1_3 -> (use a1 to fly from c1 to c2) -> either l2_4 or l2_2 -> (back to) l1_4. This satisfies all the constraints related to p1.

Let's develop a detailed sequential plan to satisfy all these constraints:

1. Load p2 onto truck t2 (which needs to move from l2_5 to l2_2 first):
   - drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
   - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

2. Move p2 from l2_2 to l2_4 (to satisfy constraint 11):
   - drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2
   - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
   - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

3. Move p2 from l2_4 to l2_5 (to satisfy constraint 9 for the future):
   - drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2
   - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
   - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5

4. Move p2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (to satisfy constraint 5):
   - drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
   - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

5. Load p2 onto airplane a2:
   - loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

6. Fly p2 from l2_1 to l1_1 (to satisfy constraint 3):
   - flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
   - unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

7. Move p2 from l1_1 to l1_2 (to satisfy constraint 4):
   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
   - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
   - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

8. Move p2 from l1_2 to l1_4 (to satisfy constraint 1):
   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
   - drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1
   - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

9. Move p2 from l1_4 to l1_3 (to satisfy constraint 8 and the goal):
   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
   - drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1
   - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

10. Load p1 onto truck t1 (in l1_3):
   - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3

11. Move p1 from l1_3 to l1_1:
   - drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
   - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

12. Load p1 onto airplane a1 (to satisfy constraint 7):
   - loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

13. Fly p1 from l1_1 to l2_1:
   - flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
   - unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

14. Move p1 from l2_1 to l2_2 (to satisfy constraint 2, and another option to satisfy constraint 6):
   - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
   - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
   - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

15. Move p1 back to l2_1:
   - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
   - drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
   - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

16. Load p1 back onto an airplane (let's use a2 for this):
   - loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

17. Fly p1 from l2_1 to l1_1:
   - flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
   - unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

18. Move p1 from l1_1 to l1_4 (to satisfy the goal):
   - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
   - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
   - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

Hmm, steps 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 of the plan are incorrect, because I've been confused about where the trucks and airplanes are after each step. Let me replan from the beginning, very carefully, making sure I consider the current locations of vehicles as well.

Actually, I realize we may also run into issues where we need to consider a globally optimal plan because vehicle availabilitiy can be an issue. Let me try to think more carefully about the plan, and use a sort of timeline approach to keep track of where everything is at each step.

Actually, I think it makes most sense to plan for p1 and p2 separately, while keeping track of vehicle locations.

Initial state:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_3
- Truck t2 is in location l2_5
- Package p1 is in location l1_3
- Package p2 is in location l2_2
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

First, let's plan for p2, which is initially in l2_2 (satisfying constraint 10):

1. Move truck t2 from l2_5 to l2_2:
   - drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2

2. Load p2 onto truck t2:
   - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

3. Move p2 from l2_2 to l2_4 (to satisfy constraint 11):
   - drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2
   - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
   - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

4. Move p2 from l2_4 to l2_5 (to satisfy constraint 9 for the future):
   - drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2
   - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
   - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5

5. Move p2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (to satisfy constraint 5):
   - drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
   - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

6. Load p2 onto airplane a2 (already in l2_1):
   - loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

7. Fly p2 from l2_1 to l1_1 (to satisfy constraint 3):
   - flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
   - unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

At this point, we need truck t1, which is in l1_3. Let's move it to l1_1 to pick up p2.

8. Move truck t1 from l1_3 to l1_1:
   - drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1

9. Load p2 onto truck t1:
   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

10. Move p2 from l1_1 to l1_2 (to satisfy constraint 4):
   - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
   - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

11. Load p2 back onto truck t1:
   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

12. Move p2 from l1_2 to l1_4 (to satisfy constraint 1):
   - drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1
   - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

13. Load p2 back onto truck t1:
   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

14. Move p2 from l1_4 to l1_3 (to satisfy constraint 8 and the goal):
   - drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1
   - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

Now, let's plan for p1, which is initially in l1_3:

15. Load p1 onto truck t1 (already in l1_3):
   - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3

16. Move p1 from l1_3 to l1_1:
   - drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
   - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

17. Load p1 onto airplane a1 (to satisfy constraint 7):
   - loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

18. Fly p1 from l1_1 to l2_1:
   - flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
   - unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

19. Load p1 onto truck t2 (now in l2_1):
   - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

20. Move p1 from l2_1 to l2_2 (to satisfy constraint 2 and 6):
   - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
   - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

21. Load p1 back onto truck t2:
   - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

22. Move p1 from l2_2 to l2_1:
   - drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
   - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

23. Load p1 onto airplane a1 (already in l2_1):
   - loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

24. Fly p1 from l2_1 to l1_1:
   - flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
   - unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

25. Load p1 onto truck t1 (in l1_1):
   - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

26. Move p1 from l1_1 to l1_4 (to satisfy the goal):
   - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
   - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

Wait, there's a problem with my logic again. Let's draw a table to keep track of where everything is, step by step. But first, let me try to optimize the plan to minimize the steps.

I realize that my approach is getting overly complex. Let me take a step back and try a simpler approach with a clearer understanding of the constraints:

Constraints for p2:
- p2 must be in l2_2 at some point (satisfied initially).
- p2 must be in l2_4 or p1 must be in l2_3 at some point after p2 is in l2_2.
- p2 must be in l2_1 at some point.
- p2 or p1 must be in l2_2 after p2 is in l2_1.
- p2 must be in l1_1 at some point.
- p2 must be in l1_2 after p2 is in l1_1.
- p2 must be in l1_4 at some point.
- p2 must be in l1_3 at some point.
- p2 must have been in l2_3 or l2_5 before being in l1_3.
- p2 must end in l1_3 (goal).

Constraints for p1:
- p1 must be in l2_4 or l2_2 at some point.
- p1 must be in a1 at some point.
- p1 must end in l1_4 (goal).

Alright, let's simplify things. Given these constraints, we can plan the movements:

For p2 (currently in l2_2):
1. Move p2 from l2_2 to l2_4 (to satisfy the constraint that after p2 is in l2_2, either p2 must be in l2_4 or p1 must be in l2_3).
2. Move p2 from l2_4 to l2_5 (to satisfy the constraint that p2 must have been in l2_3 or l2_5 before being in l1_3).
3. Move p2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (to satisfy the constraint that p2 must be in l2_1 at some point).
4. Move p2 from l2_1 to l1_1 (using an airplane, to satisfy the constraint that p2 must be in l1_1 at some point).
5. Move p2 from l1_1 to l1_2 (to satisfy the constraint that p2 must be in l1_2 after p2 is in l1_1).
6. Move p2 from l1_2 to l1_4 (to satisfy the constraint that p2 must be in l1_4 at some point).
7. Move p2 from l1_4 to l1_3 (to satisfy the goal).

For p1 (currently in l1_3):
1. Move p1 from l1_3 to l1_1.
2. Load p1 onto a1 and fly to l2_1 (to satisfy the constraint that p1 must be in a1 at some point).
3. Move p1 from l2_1 to l2_2 (to satisfy the constraint that p1 must be in l2_4 or l2_2 at some point, and also to satisfy the constraint that after p2 is in l2_1, either p2 or p1 must be in l2_2).
4. Move p1 back to l1_1 (using an airplane).
5. Move p1 from l1_1 to l1_4 (to satisfy the goal).

OK, the two constraints we need to be careful about are:
Constraint 6: If p2 is in l2_1, then either p2 or p1 must eventually be in l2_2.
Constraint 11: If p2 is in l2_2, then either p1 must be in l2_3 or p2 must be in l2_4 at the same time or later.

For constraint 6, this means that AFTER p2 is in l2_1, EITHER p2 or p1 must be in l2_2. For this, we can use p1, which will be in l2_2 later in our plan.

For constraint 11, this means that AFTER p2 is in l2_2, EITHER p1 must be in l2_3 OR p2 must be in l2_4. For this, we'll move p2 to l2_4.

Now let's try to be very explicit about the movement of trucks and airplanes:

1. Move truck t2 from l2_5 to l2_2 to pick up p2:
   - drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2

2. Load p2 onto truck t2:
   - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

3. Move p2 from l2_2 to l2_4 (to satisfy constraint 11):
   - drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2

4. Move p2 from l2_4 to l2_5 (to satisfy constraint 9 for the future):
   - drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2
   - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5

5. Re-load p2 onto truck t2 (assuming we need to unload it to satisfy the constraint):
   - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5

6. Move p2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (to satisfy constraint 5):
   - drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
   - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

7. Load p2 onto airplane a2 (already in l2_1):
   - loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

8. Fly p2 from l2_1 to l1_1 (to satisfy constraint 3):
   - flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
   - unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

(Truck t1 is needed here but is in l1_3. Let's move it to l1_1.)

9. Move truck t1 from l1_3 to l1_1:
   - drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1

10. Load p2 onto truck t1:
    - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

11. Move p2 from l1_1 to l1_2 (to satisfy constraint 4):
    - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
    - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

12. Re-load p2 onto truck t1 (assuming we need to unload it to satisfy the constraint):
    - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

13. Move p2 from l1_2 to l1_4 (to satisfy constraint 1):
    - drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1
    - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

14. Re-load p2 onto truck t1 (assuming we need to unload it to satisfy the constraint):
    - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

15. Move p2 from l1_4 to l1_3 (to satisfy constraint 8 and the goal):
    - drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1
    - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

(Now, let's handle p1 which is in l1_3. Truck t1 is also in l1_3.)

16. Load p1 onto truck t1:
    - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3

17. Move p1 from l1_3 to l1_1:
    - drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
    - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

18. Load p1 onto airplane a1 (to satisfy constraint 7):
    - loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

19. Fly p1 from l1_1 to l2_1:
    - flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
    - unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

(Truck t2 is already in l2_1 from step 6.)

20. Load p1 onto truck t2:
    - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

21. Move p1 from l2_1 to l2_2 (to satisfy constraint 2 and 6):
    - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
    - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

22. Re-load p1 onto truck t2:
    - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

23. Move p1 from l2_2 to l2_1:
    - drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
    - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

24. Load p1 onto airplane a1 (already in l2_1 from step 19):
    - loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

25. Fly p1 from l2_1 to l1_1:
    - flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
    - unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

(Truck t1 is in l1_1 from step 17.)

26. Load p1 onto truck t1:
    - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

27. Move p1 from l1_1 to l1_4 (to satisfy the goal):
    - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
    - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

So, the final plan is:

I realize there's a problem with my logic because I'm repeating loading and unloading packages just to satisfy constraints, without a clear reason. Let me take a step back and refactor the plan, making sure that each action is justified:

1. Move truck t2 from l2_5 to l2_2 to pick up p2:
   - drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2

2. Load p2 onto truck t2:
   - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
   (p2 is now in l2_2, satisfying constraint 10)

3. Move p2 from l2_2 to l2_4 (to satisfy constraint 11):
   - drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2
   (p2 is now in l2_4 after being in l2_2, satisfying constraint 11)

4. Move p2 from l2_4 to l2_5 (to satisfy constraint 9 for the future):
   - drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2
   (p2 is now in l2_5, which will satisfy constraint 9 when p2 is later in l1_3)

5. Move p2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (to satisfy constraint 5):
   - drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
   - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
   (p2 is now in l2_1, satisfying constraint 5)

6. Load p2 onto airplane a2 (already in l2_1):
   - loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

7. Fly p2 from l2_1 to l1_1 (to satisfy constraint 3):
   - flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
   - unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
   (p2 is now in l1_1, satisfying constraint 3)

8. Move truck t1 from l1_3 to l1_1:
   - drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1

9. Load p2 onto truck t1:
   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

10. Move p2 from l1_1 to l1_2 (to satisfy constraint 4):
    - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
    - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
    (p2 is now in l1_2 after being in l1_1, satisfying constraint 4)

11. Load p2 back onto truck t1:
    - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

12. Move p2 from l1_2 to l1_4 (to satisfy constraint 1):
    - drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1
    - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
    (p2 is now in l1_4, satisfying constraint 1)

13. Load p2 back onto truck t1:
    - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

14. Move p2 from l1_4 to l1_3 (to satisfy constraint 8 and the goal):
    - drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1
    - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
    (p2 is now in l1_3 after having been in l2_5, satisfying constraints 8 and 9, and the goal for p2)

15. Load p1 onto truck t1 (already in l1_3):
    - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3

16. Move p1 from l1_3 to l1_1:
    - drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
    - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

17. Load p1 onto airplane a1 (to satisfy constraint 7):
    - loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
    (p1 is now in a1, satisfying constraint 7)

18. Fly p1 from l1_1 to l2_1:
    - flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
    - unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

19. Load p1 onto truck t2 (in l2_1 from step 5):
    - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

20. Move p1 from l2_1 to l2_2 (to satisfy constraints 2 and 6):
    - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
    - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
    (p1 is now in l2_2, satisfying constraint 2, and p1 is in l2_2 after p2 was in l2_1, satisfying constraint 6)

21. Load p1 back onto truck t2:
    - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

22. Move p1 from l2_2 to l2_1:
    - drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
    - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

23. Load p1 onto airplane a1 (already in l2_1 from step 18):
    - loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

24. Fly p1 from l2_1 to l1_1:
    - flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
    - unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

25. Load p1 onto truck t1 (in l1_1 from step 16):
    - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

26. Move p1 from l1_1 to l1_4 (to satisfy the goal):
    - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
    - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
    (p1 is now in l1_4, satisfying the goal for p1)

Wait, I see there would be a problem at step 16: we cannot move t1 from l1_3 to l1_1 because at step 14, we've already moved t1 to l1_3 and unloaded p2 there. Then, immediately after, in step 15, we load p1 onto t1 (in l1_3), so t1 is already at l1_3. Let me check the entire plan more carefully to see if there are similar mistakes.

Actually, the plan is fine. It's just that I should make sure when I say there's a step that involves

I think I ended up overthinking this, and I believe the plan above is correct. Let's revise it one more time to make sure each action makes sense:

Actually we have an issue. After step 14, the truck t1 is in l1_3 with p1, and we're about to load p1 onto t1. But then in step 16, we're trying to move t1 from l1_3 to l1_1, which is a redundant step because t1 is already in l1_3.

Let me be more diligent in noting the locations of each vehicle and each package at each step.

Initially, we have:
t1 at l1_3
t2 at l2_5
p1 at l1_3
p2 at l2_2
a1 at l1_1
a2 at l2_1

The plan is:
1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
   - Now t2 is at l2_2
2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
   - Now p2 is in t2, which is at l2_2
3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2
   - Now t2 (carrying p2) is at l2_4
4. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2
   - Now t2 (carrying p2) is at l2_5
5. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
   - Now t2 (carrying p2) is at l2_1
6. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
   - Now p2 is at l2_1 (satisfying constraint 5), t2 is at l2_1
7. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
   - Now p2 is in a2, which is at l2_1
8. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
   - Now a2 (carrying p2) is at l1_1
9. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
   - Now p2 is at l1_1 (satisfying constraint 3), a2 is at l1_1
10. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
    - Now t1 is at l1_1, p1 is still at l1_3
11. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
    - Now p2 is in t1, which is at l1_1
12. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
    - Now t1 (carrying p2) is at l1_2
13. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
    - Now p2 is at l1_2 (satisfying constraint 4), t1 is at l1_2
14. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
    - Now p2 is in t1, which is at l1_2
15. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1
    - Now t1 (carrying p2) is at l1_4
16. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
    - Now p2 is at l1_4 (satisfying constraint 1), t1 is at l1_4
17. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
    - Now p2 is in t1, which is at l1_4
18. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1
    - Now t1 (carrying p2) is at l1_3
19. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
    - Now p2 is at l1_3 (satisfying constraint 8 and the goal for p2), t1 is at l1_3
20. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
    - Now p1 is in t1, which is at l1_3
21. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
    - Now t1 (carrying p1) is at l1_1
22. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
    - Now p1 is at l1_1, t1 is at l1_1
23. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
    - Now p1 is in a1, which is at l1_1 (satisfying constraint 7)
24. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
    - Now a1 (carrying p1) is at l2_1
25. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
    - Now p1 is at l2_1, a1 is at l2_1
26. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
    - Now p1 is in t2, which is at l2_1
27. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
    - Now t2 (carrying p1) is at l2_2
28. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
    - Now p1 is at l2_2 (satisfying constraint 2), t2 is at l2_2
    - Also, p1 is in l2_2 after p2 was in l2_1 (satisfying constraint 6)
29. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
    - Now p1 is in t2, which is at l2_2
30. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
    - Now t2 (carrying p1) is at l2_1
31. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
    - Now p1 is at l2_1, t2 is at l2_1
32. loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
    - Now p1 is in a1, which is at l2_1
33. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
    - Now a1 (carrying p1) is at l1_1
34. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
    - Now p1 is at l1_1, a1 is at l1_1
35. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
    - Now p1 is in t1, which is at l1_1
36. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
    - Now t1 (carrying p1) is at l1_4
37. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
    - Now p1 is at l1_4 (satisfying the goal for p1), t1 is at l1_4

OK. I think that's the correct plan. Let's check all the constraints one by one to make absolutely sure:

1. p2 must be in l1_4 at some point: Yes, in step 16.
2. p1 must be in either l2_4 or l2_2 at some point: Yes, p1 is in l2_2 in step 28.
3. p2 must be in l1_1 at some point: Yes, in step 9.
4. If p2 is in l1_1, then p2 must eventually be in l1_2: Yes, p2 is in l1_1 in step 9 and then in l1_2 in step 13.
5. p2 must be in l2_1 at some point: Yes, in step 6.
6. If p2 is in l2_1, then either p2 or p1 must eventually be in l2_2: Yes, p2 is in l2_1 in step 6 and then p1 is in l2_2 in step 28.
7. p1 must be in a1 (airplane) at some point: Yes, in step 23.
8. p2 must be in l1_3 at some point: Yes, in step 19.
9. If p2 is in l1_3, then there must have been a previous state where p2 was in either l2_3 or l2_5: Yes, p2 is in l1_3 in step 19 and was in l2_5 in step 4.
10. p2 must be in l2_2 at some point: Yes, initially.
11. If p2 is in l2_2, then either p1 must be in l2_3 or p2 must be in l2_4 at the same time or later: Yes, p2 is in l2_2 in step 2 and then in l2_4 in step 3.

All constraints are satisfied. The plan is valid.

```

Actually, there are a couple of issues I just realized:

1. In the problem statement, it says "Package t1 is in location l1_3", "Package t2 is in location l2_5", "Package a1 is in location l1_1", "Package a2 is in location l2_1", but t1, t2, a1, and a2 are vehicles, not packages. They shouldn't have "Package" in these statements. But regardless, I've taken t1, t2, a1, and a2 to be vehicles, which I think is correct.

2. I don't need to unload and load packages to satisfy constraints. For example, if a package is in a truck, and the truck is in a certain location, the package is already at that location in the sense required for the constraints. I only need to unload a package at its goal location or if I need to transfer it to another vehicle.

I think I need to make tradeoffs between the simplicity of the plan (fewer steps, more direct) and the strict reading of the constraints. It's possible a simpler solution exists. But for now, I'll go with the above plan.
