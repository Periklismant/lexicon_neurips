Let's first clarify the objects in our domain:

Locations:
- l1_1 (airport in city c1)
- l1_2 (location in city c1)
- l1_3 (location in city c1)
- l1_4 (location in city c1)
- l1_5 (location in city c1)
- l2_1 (airport in city c2)
- l2_2 (location in city c2)
- l2_3 (location in city c2)
- l2_4 (location in city c2)
- l2_5 (location in city c2)

Cities:
- c1
- c2

Packages:
- p1
- p2

Trucks:
- t1
- t2

Airplanes:
- a1
- a2

Now, let's examine the initial state of the world:
1. "Package t1 is in location l1_2"
2. "Package t2 is in location l2_5"
3. "Package p1 is in location l2_1"
4. "Package p2 is in location l1_4"
5. "Package a1 is in location l1_1"
6. "Package a2 is in location l2_1"

Wait, there seems to be a mistake in the initial state. Trucks (t1, t2) and airplanes (a1, a2) are labeled as packages. Let me reformulate the initial state:

1. "Truck t1 is in location l1_2"
2. "Truck t2 is in location l2_5"
3. "Package p1 is in location l2_1"
4. "Package p2 is in location l1_4"
5. "Airplane a1 is in location l1_1"
6. "Airplane a2 is in location l2_1"

The goal state is:
1. "Package p1 is in location l2_3"
2. "Package p2 is in location l1_3"

Additionally, we have a constraint that package p1 must be in location l2_2 at some point during the plan's execution.

Now, let's outline a plan:

For package p1:
- It starts at l2_1 (an airport in city c2).
- It needs to visit l2_2 (a location in city c2) during the execution of the plan.
- It ultimately needs to end up at l2_3 (another location in city c2).

Since all of these locations are in the same city (c2), we can use a truck to transport p1.

For package p2:
- It starts at l1_4 (a location in city c1).
- It needs to end up at l1_3 (another location in city c1).

Again, since both locations are in the same city (c1), we can use a truck to transport p2.

Let's plan the moves:

For p1:
- We have truck t2 in location l2_5.
- We need to move t2 to l2_1, load p1, drive to l2_2, continue to l2_3, and unload p1.

For p2:
- We have truck t1 in location l1_2.
- We need to move t1 to l1_4, load p2, drive to l1_3, and unload p2.

Here's the detailed plan:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2: Move truck t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 in city c2.
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1: Load package p1 into truck t2 at location l2_1.
3. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2: Drive truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_2 in city c2.
   (This satisfies the constraint that package p1 must be in location l2_2 at some point.)
4. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2: Drive truck t2 from l2_2 to l2_3 in city c2.
5. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3: Unload package p1 from truck t2 at location l2_3.

6. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1: Move truck t1 from l1_2 to l1_4 in city c1.
7. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4: Load package p2 into truck t1 at location l1_4.
8. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1: Drive truck t1 from l1_4 to l1_3 in city c1.
9. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3: Unload package p2 from truck t1 at location l1_3.

Wait, let's check if the above satisfies the constraint:

The constraint says: "Package p1 is in location l2_2" must hold in at least one state.

In the original plan, after step 3, we have:
- Truck t2 is in location l2_2.
- Package p1 is inside truck t2.

But the constraint specifically requires that package p1 is in location l2_2, not inside a truck in location l2_2. So we need to modify our plan:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2: Move truck t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 in city c2.
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1: Load package p1 into truck t2 at location l2_1.
3. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2: Drive truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_2 in city c2.
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2: Unload package p1 from truck t2 at location l2_2.
   (This satisfies the constraint that package p1 must be in location l2_2 at some point.)
5. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2: Load package p1 back into truck t2 at location l2_2.
6. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2: Drive truck t2 from l2_2 to l2_3 in city c2.
7. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3: Unload package p1 from truck t2 at location l2_3.

8. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1: Move truck t1 from l1_2 to l1_4 in city c1.
9. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4: Load package p2 into truck t1 at location l1_4.
10. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1: Drive truck t1 from l1_4 to l1_3 in city c1.
11. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3: Unload package p2 from truck t1 at location l1_3.

Let me check the details again. The constraint says:

"The following expression must hold in at least one state: "Package p1 is in location l2_2""

After step 4, package p1 is at location l2_2, which satisfies the constraint. The plan works for both packages:

For p1:
- It starts at l2_1
- It visits l2_2 (satisfying the constraint)
- It ends up at l2_3

For p2:
- It starts at l1_4
- It ends up at l1_3

Actually, I think in step 4, p1 will be at location l2_2, satisfying the constraint. See:
1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2: Move truck t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 in city c2.
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1: Load package p1 into truck t2 at location l2_1.
3. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2: Drive truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_2 in city c2.
  * (In this step, Truck t2 is in location l2_2, and Package p1 is in Truck t2)
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2: Unload package p1 from truck t2 at location l2_2.
  * (In this step, Package p1 is in location l2_2, which satisfies the constraint.)
  
Ok so after step 4, the constraint is satisfied. Continuing with our plan:
5. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2: Load package p1 back into truck t2 at location l2_2.
6. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2: Drive truck t2 from l2_2 to l2_3 in city c2.
7. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3: Unload package p1 from truck t2 at location l2_3.

8. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1: Move truck t1 from l1_2 to l1_4 in city c1.
9. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4: Load package p2 into truck t1 at location l1_4.
10. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1: Drive truck t1 from l1_4 to l1_3 in city c1.
11. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3: Unload package p2 from truck t1 at location l1_3.

This looks good, this is our final plan. Let me do a final check:

Init:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_2
- Truck t2 is in location l2_5
- Package p1 is in location l2_1
- Package p2 is in location l1_4
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1
- Others (airport locations, city attributes, etc.)

Goal:
- Package p1 is in location l2_3
- Package p2 is in location l1_3

Constraint:
- Package p1 is in location l2_2 at some point

Our plan:
1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2: Move truck t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 in city c2.
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1: Load package p1 into truck t2 at location l2_1.
3. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2: Drive truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_2 in city c2.
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2: Unload package p1 from truck t2 at location l2_2. (Constraint satisfied)
5. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2: Load package p1 back into truck t2 at location l2_2.
6. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2: Drive truck t2 from l2_2 to l2_3 in city c2.
7. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3: Unload package p1 from truck t2 at location l2_3. (Goal for p1 achieved)

8. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1: Move truck t1 from l1_2 to l1_4 in city c1.
9. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4: Load package p2 into truck t1 at location l1_4.
10. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1: Drive truck t1 from l1_4 to l1_3 in city c1.
11. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3: Unload package p2 from truck t1 at location l1_3. (Goal for p2 achieved)

The plan satisfies all constraints and goals.

Wait, on a second thought, let me make sure we can run operations in parallel (for p1 and p2). I think we can, as there's no direct dependency between the operations for the two packages. Let me double-check the optimality of the plan.

For p1:
- We need to bring it from l2_1 to l2_3, with a visit to l2_2 in between.
- We're using truck t2, which starts at l2_5. We move it to l2_1, load p1, move to l2_2, unload (to satisfy the constraint), reload, move to l2_3, and unload.

For p2:
- We need to bring it from l1_4 to l1_3.
- We're using truck t1, which starts at l1_2. We move it to l1_4, load p2, move to l1_3, and unload.

I don't see a shorter or more efficient way to transport the packages, given the constraint that p1 must be at l2_2 at some point. So this seems optimal.

Here's the final plan:
1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2: Move truck t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 in city c2.
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1: Load package p1 into truck t2 at location l2_1.
3. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2: Drive truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_2 in city c2.
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2: Unload package p1 from truck t2 at location l2_2.
5. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2: Load package p1 back into truck t2 at location l2_2.
6. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2: Drive truck t2 from l2_2 to l2_3 in city c2.
7. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3: Unload package p1 from truck t2 at location l2_3.

8. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1: Move truck t1 from l1_2 to l1_4 in city c1.
9. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4: Load package p2 into truck t1 at location l1_4.
10. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1: Drive truck t1 from l1_4 to l1_3 in city c1.
11. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3: Unload package p2 from truck t1 at location l1_3.
