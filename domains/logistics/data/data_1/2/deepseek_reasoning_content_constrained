Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. First, I need to understand the initial state, the goal, and the constraints. 

The initial state has packages p1 and p2. From the description, p1 is in l2_4 (city c2), and p2 is in l1_5 (city c1). The goal is to have p1 in l1_5 (city c1) and p2 in l1_3 (city c1). 

The constraints are a bit tricky. The first constraint requires that at some point, p1 is in l2_1 (which is an airport in c2). Also, whenever p1 is in l2_1, there must have been a previous state where p1 was either in l2_2 or l1_4. So, to satisfy this, p1 must pass through l2_2 or l1_4 before reaching l2_1.

Looking at the cities and the available transport: c1 has locations l1_1 (airport), l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5. c2 has l2_1 (airport), l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5. 

Trucks can move within a city. So in c1, t1 is in l1_5. In c2, t2 is in l2_2. Airplanes a1 is in l1_1 (c1's airport), a2 is in l2_1 (c2's airport). 

For p1: starts at l2_4 (c2). Need to get it to l1_5 (c1). To move between cities, we need an airplane. So the plan might involve moving p1 from l2_4 to l2_1 (airport) via truck, load onto airplane a2, fly to c1's airport l1_1, then unload and transport via truck to l1_5. But wait, the constraint says that p1 must be in l2_1 at some point, which is part of the plan. But we also need to ensure that before p1 is in l2_1, it was in l2_2 or l1_4. Since p1 starts in l2_4 (c2), maybe we can move it to l2_2 first? But how?

Wait, the initial locations: p1 is in l2_4. The constraint requires that when p1 is in l2_1, there was a prior state where p1 was in l2_2 or l1_4. Since l2_4 is in c2, moving p1 to l2_2 would require a truck in c2. The truck t2 is in l2_2. Wait, wait, the original state says "Package t1 is in location l1_5" and "Package t2 is in location l2_2". Wait, that's probably a typo. Wait, looking back: "Package t1 is in location l1_5" — no, wait, the objects include "truck t1" and "truck t2". So probably, the original state should say "Truck t1 is in location l1_5" and "Truck t2 is in location l2_2". Because packages are p1, p2. So the user might have made a typo there. So correcting that: t1 is a truck in l1_5 (c1), t2 is a truck in l2_2 (c2). 

So for p1 in l2_4 (c2), to get it to l2_1 (airport of c2), we need to use truck t2. But t2 is in l2_2. So first, drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_4, load p1 onto t2, then drive to l2_1. But the constraint requires that before p1 is in l2_1, it was in l2_2 or l1_4. If we drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_4 (so t2 is now in l2_4), load p1 into t2, then drive back to l2_2 (so p1 would be in l2_2 when unloaded there?), then maybe that's a way. Wait, but the constraint is that when p1 is in l2_1, it must have been in l2_2 or l1_4 earlier. So maybe moving p1 from l2_4 to l2_2 via truck, then to l2_1. Let's think:

1. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_4 (since t2 is in l2_2 initially). Then load p1 into t2 at l2_4. Then drive t2 to l2_2. Then unload p1 at l2_2. Now p1 is in l2_2. Then drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1 (airport), load p1 into t2 again, drive to l2_1. Wait, but l2_1 is an airport. Can trucks drive there? Yes, because l2_1 is a location in c2. So after unloading p1 in l2_2, then drive t2 to l2_1 (if possible). But the drivetruck action requires that the locations are in the same city. Since l2_2 and l2_1 are both in c2, yes. So drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1. Then load p1 onto airplane a2 (which is at l2_1). Then fly a2 to l1_1. Then unload p1, load onto truck t1 (which is in l1_5, but we need to drive t1 to l1_1? Wait, t1 is in l1_5. To get to the airport l1_1, t1 can drive through the city. So:

But this is getting complicated. Let's outline possible steps for p1:

p1 is at l2_4 (c2). Need to get to l1_5 (c1). Steps:

- Move p1 to l2_1 (airport of c2) via truck t2.

But to use t2, which is in l2_2. So:

1. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_4 (c2). Now t2 is in l2_4.

2. Load p1 into t2 at l2_4.

3. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1 (airport). Since l2_4 is in c2, and l2_1 is also in c2, this is allowed.

4. Unload p1 at l2_1. Now p1 is in l2_1. But the constraint says that when p1 is in l2_1, there must have been a prior state where p1 was in l2_2 or l1_4. In this case, p1 was in l2_4, then loaded into t2 and moved to l2_1. But that doesn't satisfy the constraint because p1 wasn't in l2_2 or l1_4 before. So this path would not satisfy the constraint.

So to satisfy the constraint, before p1 arrives at l2_1, it must have been in either l2_2 or l1_4. How can we arrange that?

Alternative plan: 

After loading p1 into t2 at l2_4, drive t2 to l2_2 (so p1 is in l2_2 when unloaded), then load again into t2 and drive to l2_1. That way, when p1 is in l2_1, it was previously in l2_2. That would satisfy the constraint.

So steps for p1:

1. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_4 (allowed, same city c2).

2. Load p1 into t2 at l2_4.

3. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_2.

4. Unload p1 at l2_2. Now p1 is in l2_2.

5. Load p1 into t2 at l2_2.

6. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1.

7. Unload p1 at l2_1. Now p1 is in l2_1. This satisfies the constraint because before being in l2_1, it was in l2_2.

Then, load p1 into airplane a2 at l2_1.

Fly a2 to l1_1 (c1's airport).

Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1.

Now, to get p1 to l1_5. Use truck t1, which is in l1_5. So drive t1 to l1_1:

8. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_1 (c1).

9. Load p1 into t1 at l1_1.

10. Drive t1 back to l1_5.

11. Unload p1 at l1_5. Now p1 is in the goal.

For p2: starts in l1_5 (c1). Need to get to l1_3. Since t1 is in l1_5, load p2 into t1, drive to l1_3, unload.

So steps for p2:

12. Load p2 into t1 at l1_5.

13. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_3.

14. Unload p2 at l1_3. Done.

But wait, the steps for p1 and p2 can be interleaved. However, we need to make sure that all actions are properly ordered. Also, the truck t1 is used for both p1 and p2. Let's see.

But after step 10, t1 is back in l1_5. Then, steps 12-14 would be after that. So the order could be:

Handle p1 first, then p2. But maybe we can interleave for efficiency. Let's see.

Wait, the plan needs to be optimal (shortest possible). So perhaps combining steps where possible.

Wait, the steps for p1's movement would be:

From l2_4 to l2_2 (via truck t2), then to l2_1, then fly to l1_1, then drive t1 to l1_1, load, drive back to l1_5. Then for p2, use t1 in l1_5 to drive to l1_3.

But let's count the steps.

For p1:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
3. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
5. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
6. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
7. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
8. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
9. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
10. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
11. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
12. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
13. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
14. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5

For p2:

15. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
16. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1
17. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

Total 17 steps. But can we optimize this?

Wait, after step 13 (driving t1 back to l1_5), we can load p2 into t1 (step 15) and drive to l1_3 (step 16). But step 13 is driving t1 from l1_1 to l1_5. Then, steps 15 and 16 would be after that. So that's correct.

But perhaps we can interleave steps for p2 earlier. For example, after step 11, when t1 is driven to l1_1, maybe we can handle p2 first. Wait, no, because t1 is in l1_5 initially, and we need to drive it to l1_1 to load p1. So after step 11 (driving t1 to l1_1), t1 is in l1_1. Then after loading p1 (step 12) and driving back (step 13), t1 is back in l1_5. Then we can load p2 and drive to l1_3. So that's the correct order.

But let's check if the steps can be optimized. For example, after step 14 (unloading p1 in l1_5), then steps for p2 can be done. But maybe p2 can be moved while t1 is in l1_5. Wait, t1 starts in l1_5. So initially, p2 is in l1_5. So steps for p2 could be done first. Let's see:

If we first move p2 to l1_3, then use t1 to move p1. Let's see:

p2 steps:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
2. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1
3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

Then, t1 is in l1_3. But for moving p1, t1 needs to go to l1_1. So from l1_3 to l1_1, but the drive action can go directly. Wait, but cities have multiple locations. Are l1_1 and l1_3 connected? The problem states that trucks can move between any locations in the same city, so yes. So after moving p2 to l1_3, t1 is there. Then, drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1, load p1, drive to l1_5. But this would require more steps. Let's count:

p2 steps: 3 steps.

Then for p1:

4. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
5. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (but p1 hasn't arrived yet)
Wait, p1 is still in l2_4. So no, this approach won't work. Because p1 needs to be moved via airplane first. So the initial approach of handling p1 first might be better.

So perhaps the initial plan is the shortest. Let's count steps again for p1 and p2:

p1 requires steps 1-14 (14 steps), p2 steps 15-17 (3 steps). Total 17 steps.

But maybe there's a way to optimize. For example, after step 10 (unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1), instead of driving t1 from l1_5 to l1_1, perhaps use another truck. But the only truck in c1 is t1. So t1 is in l1_5. So we have to drive t1 to l1_1, load p1, drive back to l1_5. That's 3 steps (11,12,13). Then unload (14). Then handle p2 (15-17). So total steps: 17.

Alternatively, can we load p1 into t1 at l1_1 and drive to l1_5, but during that trip, also move p2? No, because p2 is in l1_5. Wait, p2 is in l1_5 initially, so after t1 is in l1_1, it's loaded with p1, then driven to l1_5. When unloading p1 at l1_5, t1 is there. Then load p2 into t1 and drive to l1_3. That's possible.

So steps:

For p1:

1. (as before) steps 1-10: p1 arrives at l1_1 via airplane.

11. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1 (t1 goes to l1_1)

12. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

13. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1

14. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 (now p1 is in l1_5)

For p2:

15. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

16. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1

17. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

That's 17 steps. So same as before.

But perhaps during the same trip when t1 is moving from l1_5 to l1_1 (step 11), can we carry p2? No, because p2 is in l1_5, but t1 is empty. Wait, initially, t1 is in l1_5, and p2 is in l1_5. So maybe first load p2 into t1, then drive to l1_3, unload p2, then proceed. Let's see:

Alternative plan:

For p2:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

2. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1

3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (now p2 is done in 3 steps)

Then, t1 is in l1_3. To handle p1:

4. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1

5. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (but p1 isn't there yet)

Wait, p1 is still in l2_4. So this approach won't work. Because p1 needs to be flown to l1_1 first. So we need to handle p1's transportation first.

So the initial approach where we handle p1 first, then p2, seems unavoidable.

But let's check the constraints again. The first constraint is that p1 must be in l2_1 at some state. In our initial plan for p1, yes, step 7 unloads p1 into l2_1. And before that, step 4 unloads p1 into l2_2. So when p1 is in l2_1, there was a prior state where it was in l2_2. That satisfies the constraint.

Another check: during the movement of p1, after loading into t2 at l2_4 (step 2), drive to l2_2 (step 3), unload (step4), then load again (step5), drive to l2_1 (step6), unload (step7). So yes, p1 is in l2_2 before being in l2_1. So the constraint is satisfied.

Now, putting all the steps in order:

For p1:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2

2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

3. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2

4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

5. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

6. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2

7. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

8. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

9. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

10. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

For p1 to reach l1_5:

11. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1

12. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

13. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1

14. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5

For p2:

15. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

16. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1

17. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

Total 17 steps. Is there a way to make this shorter?

Let me think: after step 7, p1 is in l2_1. Then step8 loads into airplane a2. Fly to l1_1 (step9), unload (step10). Then, to get to l1_5, need to use truck t1. But t1 is in l1_5. So drive t1 to l1_1 (step11), load p1 (step12), drive back (step13), unload (step14). That's four steps. Maybe there's a shorter path.

Wait, after p1 is unloaded at l1_1 (step10), maybe use another airplane or truck. But in c1, the only truck is t1. So no alternative. So this seems necessary.

Alternatively, is there a way to fly a1 (which is in l1_1) to some other location? But p1 needs to be in l1_5, which is not an airport, so can't fly there. So airplane can't help here. So must use truck t1.

Another idea: after unloading p1 at l1_1 (step10), can we load it onto a1 and fly to another airport, then drive? But l1_5 is not an airport. So no.

Thus, the steps for moving p1 from l1_1 to l1_5 via t1 are necessary. So steps 11-14.

For p2, since it's already in l1_5, and t1 is there, the steps 15-17 are needed.

But perhaps when t1 is driven to l1_1 (step11) and back to l1_5 (step13), after unloading p1 (step14), then load p2 into t1 (step15) and drive to l1_3. So no way to shorten.

Alternatively, can p2 be moved before p1 is handled? Let's see:

If we first move p2 to l1_3, then use t1 to move p1. But after moving p2, t1 is in l1_3. Then to get to l1_1, drive from l1_3 to l1_1 (possible). Then load p1, drive back to l1_5. But this would require:

Steps for p2:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

2. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1

3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (p2 done in 3 steps)

Then for p1:

4. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1

5. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (but p1 isn't there yet)

Wait, no, because p1 is still in l2_4. So this approach won't work. So the initial plan is necessary.

Thus, the total steps remain 17. Is there a way to reduce this?

Another angle: when moving p1 from l2_1 to l1_1, perhaps use airplane a2 (which is in l2_1). Fly to l1_1, which is correct. Then unload. Then use t1 to move. So that's covered.

Alternatively, when moving p1 from l2_4 to l2_2, can we avoid unloading and reloading? Because the constraint requires that p1 is in l2_2 before l2_1. So unloading in l2_2 is necessary. So steps 4 and 5 are necessary.

Wait, step 4 is unloading p1 into l2_2, step 5 is reloading into t2. Could we skip that and just keep p1 in t2 while driving to l2_1? But then p1 would be in t2 when arriving at l2_1. Unloading at l2_1 would be okay. But then the constraint requires that p1 was in l2_2 or l1_4 before. But if p1 is driven from l2_4 to l2_2 to l2_1 without unloading, then p1 was in l2_2 (as part of the truck's location), but not in the location itself. The constraint says "Package p1 is in location l2_2". So unless p1 is unloaded there, it doesn't count. So unloading is necessary to satisfy the constraint.

Therefore, steps 4 and 5 are required.

So I think the initial plan is optimal. Now, check for possible action optimizations.

Wait, step1: drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2.

Then load p1 into t2 (step2). Then drive back to l2_2 (step3). Unload (step4). Then load again (step5) and drive to l2_1 (step6). Unload (step7). That's a lot of steps. But perhaps necessary.

Alternatively, could we drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_4, load p1, drive directly to l2_1. But that would require that l2_4 and l2_1 are in the same city (they are, both in c2). So can we drive from l2_4 to l2_1 directly? Yes. Then:

Steps:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2

2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

3. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2

4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

But then, p1 is in l2_1 without ever being in l2_2 or l1_4. So this violates the constraint. So the previous approach with unloading in l2_2 is necessary.

Another idea: perhaps use airplane a2 to fly p1 from l2_4 to l2_1 directly. But airplanes can only be loaded at airports. Since l2_4 is not an airport (airports are l1_1 and l2_1), so we can't fly from l2_4. So must use truck to move p1 to an airport.

Thus, the initial steps are necessary.

So, the total plan is 17 steps. Is there a way to reduce this?

Wait, after step7 (unload p1 in l2_1), steps8-10 are load into airplane, fly, unload. Then steps11-14 are moving via truck.

Alternatively, can we use airplane a1 (which is in l1_1) to fly somewhere else? Not directly helpful.

Alternatively, after flying to l1_1 (step9), can we use a different truck? No, since t1 is the only truck in c1.

Another angle: when t1 is driven to l1_1 (step11), after loading p1 (step12), can we drive to l1_3 to drop off p2 on the way to l1_5? But l1_3 is not on the way. The drive actions are between any two locations in the city. So from l1_1 to l1_5 directly, or via other locations. But to drop off p2, we'd need to load p2 into the truck first. But p2 is initially in l1_5. So if t1 is in l1_1 after step11, how can we load p2? We can't, because p2 is in l1_5 and t1 is in l1_1. So p2 must be loaded when t1 is in l1_5.

Thus, the steps for p2 must happen after t1 returns to l1_5 (step14). Therefore, no optimization possible there.

So I think the plan with 17 steps is the optimal one. Now, I need to write it out correctly, ensuring that all actions are in the correct order and meet preconditions.

Let me verify each action's preconditions and effects.

Step 1: drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2

Pre: t2 is in l2_2, which is true initially. l2_2 and l2_4 are in c2. Yes. After this, t2 is in l2_4.

Step2: loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4. Pre: p1 and t2 are in l2_4. Yes, p1 starts in l2_4, t2 is now in l2_4 after step1. After loading, p1 is in t2.

Step3: drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2. Pre: t2 is in l2_4. Correct. After driving, t2 is in l2_2.

Step4: unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2. Pre: t2 is in l2_2, p1 is in t2. Yes. After unloading, p1 is in l2_2.

Step5: loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2. Pre: p1 and t2 are in l2_2. Yes. After loading, p1 is in t2.

Step6: drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2. Pre: t2 is in l2_2, l2_1 is in c2. Yes. After driving, t2 is in l2_1.

Step7: unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1. Pre: t2 in l2_1, p1 in t2. Yes. Now p1 is in l2_1, satisfying the constraint's first part.

Step8: loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1. Pre: p1 and a2 are in l2_1. a2 is initially in l2_1 (original state: "Package a2 is in location l2_1" — wait, no, the original state says "Package a1 is in location l1_1" and "Package a2 is in location l2_1". So a2 is in l2_1. Yes. So p1 is in l2_1, a2 is there. Load into a2.

Step9: flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1. Pre: a2 is in l2_1. Yes. After flying, a2 is in l1_1.

Step10: unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1. Pre: a2 in l1_1, p1 in a2. Yes. Now p1 is in l1_1.

Step11: drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1. Pre: t1 is in l1_5 (original state). Yes. After driving, t1 is in l1_1.

Step12: loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1. Pre: p1 in l1_1, t1 in l1_1. Yes. Now p1 is in t1.

Step13: drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1. Pre: t1 in l1_1. After driving, t1 is in l1_5.

Step14: unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5. Pre: t1 in l1_5, p1 in t1. Yes. Now p1 is in l1_5 (goal).

Step15: loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5. Pre: p2 and t1 are in l1_5. Yes.

Step16: drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1. Pre: t1 in l1_5. Yes.

Step17: unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3. Pre: t1 in l1_3, p2 in t1. Yes. Now p2 is in l1_3 (goal).

All steps are correct. The constraints are satisfied: p1 is in l2_1 at step7, and before that, in step4 it was in l2_2. So the constraint is met.

Now, check for possible step optimization. For example, can steps for p2 be interleaved with steps for p1 to reduce total steps?

For instance, after step14 (p1 in l1_5), steps15-17 for p2. But perhaps during the movement of t1 for p1, can we also handle p2?

Wait, after step13, t1 is back in l1_5 with p1. Then, unload p1 (step14), then load p2 (step15), drive to l1_3 (step16), unload (step17). This is the correct order.

Alternatively, when t1 is in l1_5 after step13, can we unload p1 and load p2 in the same location, then drive to l1_3. But unloading and loading requires separate steps.

Alternatively, can we unload p1 and load p2 in the same step? No, each action is separate. So no.

Thus, the plan is as outlined. The total steps are 17. I need to check if this is the minimal possible.

Is there a way to reduce steps by combining actions? For example, after step7, p1 is in l2_1. Then steps8-10: load, fly, unload. Then steps11-14: drive, load, drive, unload. That's seven steps. For p2, three steps. Total 10 steps for p1 and 3 for p2, but including the earlier steps for p1's movement via truck t2 (steps1-7: seven steps), total 17.

Alternatively, is there a better way to move p1 from l2_4 to l2_1 via truck t2 with fewer steps while satisfying the constraint?

For example:

Instead of moving t2 to l2_4, then back to l2_2, then to l2_1, maybe there's a shorter path. But the constraint requires that p1 is in l2_2 or l1_4 before being in l2_1. Since l1_4 is in c1, and p1 starts in c2, it's easier to have p1 in l2_2. So the steps are necessary.

Another thought: maybe move p1 to l2_5, then to l2_1. But l2_5 is not an airport, and the constraint isn't satisfied. So no.

Thus, I think the plan is optimal.
