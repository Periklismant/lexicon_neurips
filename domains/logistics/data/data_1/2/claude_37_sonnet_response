I need to come up with a plan to achieve:
- Package p1 is in location l1_5
- Package p2 is in location l1_3

Given the following constraints:
1. Package p1 must be in location l2_1 at some point
2. Before p1 can be in location l2_1, it must either be in location l2_2 or l1_4 at an earlier state

Let's first analyze the initial state:
- Trucks: t1 is in location l1_5, t2 is in location l2_2
- Packages: p1 is in location l2_4, p2 is in location l1_5
- Airplanes: a1 is in location l1_1 (airport in city c1), a2 is in location l2_1 (airport in city c2)

Now I'll create a plan to satisfy the goals:

For package p1:
- Initial location: l2_4 (in city c2)
- Constraint: Must visit l2_2 or l1_4 before visiting l2_1, and must visit l2_1 at some point
- Final location: l1_5 (in city c1)

For package p2:
- Initial location: l1_5 (in city c1)
- Final location: l1_3 (in city c1)

Let's create a plan:

For p1:
1. Drive truck t2 from l2_2 to l2_4 (to pick up p1)
2. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_4
3. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_2 (to satisfy constraint that p1 must be in l2_2 at some point)
4. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1 (airport)
5. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1 (to satisfy constraint that p1 must be in l2_1 at some point)
6. Load p1 onto airplane a2 at l2_1
7. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1 (airport in city c1)
8. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1
9. Drive truck t1 from l1_5 to l1_1 (to pick up p1)
10. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_1
11. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_5 (final destination for p1)
12. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_5

For p2:
1. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_5 (assuming t1 is already there from delivering p1)
2. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_3
3. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_3

Hm, I realize there's an issue in the problem description. The initial state says:
"Package t1 is in location l1_5"
"Package t2 is in location l2_2"
"Package p1 is in location l2_4"
"Package p2 is in location l1_5"
"Package a1 is in location l1_1"
"Package a2 is in location l2_1"

But trucks and airplanes shouldn't be referred to as packages. Let's assume this is an error in the problem statement, and the correct interpretation is:
"Truck t1 is in location l1_5"
"Truck t2 is in location l2_2"
"Package p1 is in location l2_4"
"Package p2 is in location l1_5"
"Airplane a1 is in location l1_1"
"Airplane a2 is in location l2_1"

With this correction, I'll proceed with my plan.

Given the corrected initial state:
- p1 starts at l2_4 in city c2
- p2 starts at l1_5 in city c1
- t1 starts at l1_5 in city c1
- t2 starts at l2_2 in city c2
- a1 starts at l1_1 (airport in city c1)
- a2 starts at l2_1 (airport in city c2)

Let me revise the plan:

For p1:
1. Drive truck t2 from l2_2 to l2_4 (to pick up p1)
2. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_4
3. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_2 (to satisfy constraint that p1 must be in l2_2 at some point)
4. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_2 (to explicitly have p1 at l2_2, satisfying the constraint)
5. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_2
6. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1 (airport)
7. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1 (to satisfy constraint that p1 must be in l2_1 at some point)
8. Load p1 onto airplane a2 at l2_1
9. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1 (airport in city c1)
10. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1
11. Drive truck t1 from l1_5 to l1_1 (to pick up p1)
12. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_1
13. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_5 (final destination for p1)
14. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_5

For p2:
1. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_5 (assuming t1 is already there from delivering p1)
2. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_3
3. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_3

Hmm, actually, looking at the constraints more carefully:
"If expression "Package p1 is in location l2_1" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: "At least one of the following conditions is true: "Package p1 is in location l2_2", "Package p1 is in location l1_4"""

So p1 must be either in l2_2 or l1_4 before it can be in l2_1. Since p1 starts in l2_4, I need to take it through l2_2 before bringing it to l2_1.

Let me make a complete plan:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
3. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2  # Satisfying the constraint that p1 must be in l2_2 before l2_1
5. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
6. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
7. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1  # Satisfying the constraint that p1 must be in l2_1 at some point
8. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
9. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
10. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
11. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
12. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
13. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
14. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5  # p1 is now at its goal location
15. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
16. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1
17. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3  # p2 is now at its goal location

Hmm, I noticed an issue with the "loadairplane p1 ap l" vs "loadairplane p ap l" in the actions description. The first seems to have incorrect parameter naming. Let me fix this:

The actions should be:
- "loadairplane p ap l": Load package p in airplane ap. Both p and ap are in location l.
- "unloadairplane p ap l": Unload package p from airplane ap in location l.

Now let me correct my plan:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
3. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2  # Satisfying the constraint that p1 must be in l2_2 before l2_1
5. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
6. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
7. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1  # Satisfying the constraint that p1 must be in l2_1 at some point
8. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
9. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
10. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
11. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
12. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
13. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
14. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5  # p1 is now at its goal location
15. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
16. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1
17. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3  # p2 is now at its goal location

Let me think about this again and see if I can optimize the plan.

There's another issue I just realized: in the actions list, there seems to be a duplicate:
"loadairplane p ap l": Load package p in airplane ap. Both p and ap are in location l.
"loadairplane p ap l": Unload package p from airplane ap in location l.

The second should be "unloadairplane p ap l". I'll assume this is just a typo and proceed.

Now, let me analyze if this plan is optimal or if there are any ways to improve it:

For p1:
- Initial location: l2_4 (in city c2)
- Must visit l2_2 (constraint) before going to l2_1 (constraint)
- Final location: l1_5 (in city c1)

For p2:
- Initial location: l1_5 (in city c1)
- Final location: l1_3 (in city c1)

Let's see if we can optimize the plan:

1. For p1, we need to move it from l2_4 to l2_2 to l2_1 to l1_1 to l1_5. This is already the shortest path given the constraints.
2. For p2, we need to move it from l1_5 to l1_3. This is also the shortest path.

The constraints force p1 to follow a specific path, and our plan already does this optimally. For p2, we're also using the shortest route.

I think my plan is already optimal, so I'll stick with it:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
3. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2  # Satisfying the constraint that p1 must be in l2_2 before l2_1
5. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
6. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
7. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1  # Satisfying the constraint that p1 must be in l2_1 at some point
8. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
9. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
10. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
11. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
12. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
13. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
14. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5  # p1 is now at its goal location
15. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
16. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1
17. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3  # p2 is now at its goal location

This plan is 17 steps long and satisfies all the constraints and goals.

Actually, let me check if we really need steps 4 and 5. The constraint states:
"If expression 'Package p1 is in location l2_1' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "Package p1 is in location l2_2", "Package p1 is in location l1_4"'"

I think the constraint is satisfied as long as p1 is physically in l2_2 at some point, regardless of whether it's inside a truck or not. Let me check the exact constraint and wording again.

The constraint specifically says: "Package p1 is in location l2_2".

This makes me think p1 must physically be at l2_2, not inside a truck in l2_2. So I need to unload p1 at l2_2 and then load it back, as I've done in steps 4 and 5. I'll keep these steps to be safe.

Therefore, my final plan is:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
3. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2  # Satisfying the constraint that p1 must be in l2_2 before l2_1
5. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
6. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
7. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1  # Satisfying the constraint that p1 must be in l2_1 at some point
8. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
9. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
10. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
11. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
12. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
13. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
14. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5  # p1 is now at its goal location
15. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
16. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1
17. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3  # p2 is now at its goal location

This plan has 17 steps and satisfies all goals and constraints.

Let me do a final check for optimality.

For p1, we need to move it from l2_4 to l1_5:
- It must visit l2_2 or l1_4 before l2_1
- It must visit l2_1 at some point

The shortest path is: l2_4 -> l2_2 -> l2_1 -> l1_1 -> l1_5, which is exactly what we're doing.

For p2, we need to move it from l1_5 to l1_3, which is a direct truck ride in one step.

The plan seems optimal. Let's check if there's any other optimization opportunity:

Could we use airplane a1 instead of a2? a1 is already at l1_1, but we'd need to fly it to l2_1 first to pick up p1, which would add an extra step. So a2 is better.

Could we use truck t1 earlier in the plan? It starts at l1_5, and we'd need to drive it to city c2 to pick up p1, which would require flying it via an airport. That would be more steps than our current plan.

I don't see any further optimizations. My final plan is optimal and valid.

Let me double-check the actions once more to make sure they're correctly formatted:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
3. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
5. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
6. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
7. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
8. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
9. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
10. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
11. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
12. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
13. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
14. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
15. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
16. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1
17. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

Actually, I just realized that I mistyped one of the actions earlier. The correct action should be "unloadairplane" (not "loadairplane" again). Let me fix that in my final plan:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
3. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
5. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
6. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
7. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
8. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
9. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
10. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
11. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
12. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
13. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
14. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
15. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
16. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1
17. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

This is my final plan, which is optimal and satisfies all goals and constraints.
