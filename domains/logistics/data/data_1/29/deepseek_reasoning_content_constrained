Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. First, I need to understand the initial state, the goal, and the constraints. 

So, the initial state has packages and vehicles in various locations across two cities, c1 and c2. The goal is to have p1 in l2_4 and p2 in l2_2. Plus, there's a constraint that at some point, p1 must be in l1_1. 

Let me list out where everything starts:

- Cities: c1 has locations l1_1 (airport), l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5. c2 has l2_1 (airport), l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5.
- Trucks: t1 is in l1_3 (city c1), t2 is in l2_4 (city c2).
- Airplanes: a1 is in l1_1 (c1's airport), a2 is in l2_1 (c2's airport).
- Packages: p1 is in l2_5 (c2), p2 is in l1_4 (c1). Wait, the original state says "Package t1 is in location l1_3" — but t1 is a truck. Maybe that's a typo. Oh, the user probably meant "Truck t1 is in location l1_3". Similarly for t2. Let me check the original state again.

Looking back: The original state says:

- "Package t1 is in location l1_3" — Wait, that can't be right because t1 is a truck. There's a mistake here. The user must have meant "Truck t1 is in location l1_3". Similarly, "Package t2 is in location l2_4" should be "Truck t2 is in l2_4". Because otherwise, there's a package named t1 and t2, which conflicts with the trucks. So I'll proceed under the assumption that those are typos. So:

Truck t1 is in l1_3 (c1), Truck t2 in l2_4 (c2). Airplanes a1 in l1_1 (c1's airport), a2 in l2_1 (c2's airport). Packages: p1 in l2_5 (c2), p2 in l1_4 (c1).

The goal is p1 in l2_4 and p2 in l2_2 (both in c2). The constraint is that at least once, p1 must be in l1_1. 

So, for p2, which is in c1's l1_4, we need to get it to c2's l2_2. Since trucks can only move within the same city, to get between cities, we need to use airplanes. Similarly for p1, which is in c2's l2_5, but needs to be in l2_4 (same city). But the constraint requires that p1 is in l1_1 (c1's airport) at some point. So p1 must be transported from c2 to c1 and then back to c2? That seems necessary to satisfy the constraint.

Let's break it down:

For p1:

Start in l2_5 (c2). Need to get to l2_4. But to meet the constraint, p1 must be in l1_1 at some point. So p1 needs to go from l2_5 in c2 to l1_1 in c1, then back to c2's l2_4. How?

Possible steps:

1. Move p1 from l2_5 to l2_1 (c2's airport) using truck t2. Because t2 is in l2_4. Wait, t2 is in l2_4. So to get to l2_5, t2 would need to drive to l2_5. But c2 has locations l2_1 (airport), l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5. So t2 is in l2_4. So drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_5 (same city c2). Then load p1 into t2. Then drive t2 to l2_1 (airport). Then unload p1 at l2_1, load into airplane a2. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1 (c1's airport). Unload p1 at l1_1 (satisfies the constraint). Then load p1 into airplane a1 (since a1 is at l1_1). Fly a1 back to l2_1. Then unload p1, load into truck t2, drive to l2_4. But that's a lot of steps.

Alternatively, after p1 is in l1_1, maybe take it back via another airplane. But let's think about the steps.

For p2: starts in l1_4 (c1). Needs to go to l2_2 (c2). So, use a truck in c1 to take p2 to l1_1 (airport), load into airplane a1, fly to l2_1, unload, then use truck t2 (in c2) to take to l2_2. But wait, t2 is in l2_4. So first, drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1 via other locations? Let's see. c2's locations include l2_1, l2_2, etc. So from l2_4 to l2_1: perhaps through l2_3, l2_2, etc. But drivetruck can move between any locations in the same city. So drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1. But that's possible? Wait, the drivetruck action allows moving from any l_from to l_to in the same city. So t2 can go directly from l2_4 to l2_1, assuming they're in the same city. So maybe the cities have a network where trucks can move directly between any locations. So, steps for p2:

In c1: load p2 into truck t1 (which is at l1_3). But p2 is at l1_4. So first, drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_4. Then load p2 into t1. Then drive t1 to l1_1 (airport). Unload p2, load into airplane a1. Fly a1 to l2_1. Then unload p2, load into truck t2 (which would need to be at l2_1). But t2 is initially at l2_4, so need to drive it to l2_1 first. Then load p2 into t2 and drive to l2_2.

Now, combining both packages' movements.

But let's first focus on p1's path to satisfy the constraint. Since p1 starts in c2, to get it to l1_1 (c1), we need to:

1. In c2: move p1 from l2_5 to l2_1 (airport). So use truck t2. But t2 is in l2_4. So drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_5 (c2), load p1, drive to l2_1, unload. Then load into airplane a2, fly to l1_1 (c1's airport). Now p1 is in l1_1, satisfying the constraint. Then, to get p1 to l2_4 (goal), we need to fly it back to c2. So load p1 into airplane a1 (which is at l1_1), fly a1 to l2_1, unload p1, load into truck t2 (if t2 is at l2_1), then drive to l2_4.

But wait, after flying a1 to l2_1, a1 would be at l2_1. Then unload p1 there, load into truck t2 which is driven to l2_1. Then drive t2 to l2_4, unload p1. That works.

Now, for p2:

Starts in l1_4 (c1). Need to get to l2_2 (c2). So:

In c1: drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_4 (current location of p2). Load p2 into t1. Drive t1 to l1_1 (airport). Unload p2, load into airplane a1. Fly a1 to l2_1. Unload p2. Then, in c2, drive truck t2 (which is initially at l2_4) to l2_1, load p2, drive to l2_2, unload.

But wait, when moving p1 back to c2, the airplane a1 is used to carry p1 from l1_1 to l2_1. But when moving p2, we need to use a1 to fly p2 from l1_1 to l2_1. But if we first fly a1 with p2, then later fly a1 again with p1, that's possible. Let's outline the steps in order.

Let me try to create a step-by-step plan.

First, handle p2:

1. In c1, drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_4 (p2's location).
   - Action: drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1
2. Load p2 into t1 at l1_4.
   - Action: loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
3. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1 (airport).
   - Action: drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
4. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1.
   - Action: unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
5. Load p2 into airplane a1 (which is at l1_1).
   - Action: loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
6. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1 (c2's airport).
   - Action: flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
7. Unload p2 from a1 at l2_1.
   - Action: unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
8. Now, in c2, need to get p2 to l2_2. So drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
   - Action: drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
9. Load p2 into t2 at l2_1.
   - Action: loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
10. Drive t2 to l2_2.
    - Action: drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
11. Unload p2 at l2_2.
    - Action: unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

That takes care of p2. Now for p1, which needs to go from l2_5 (c2) to l2_4, but with a stop in l1_1.

For p1:

12. In c2, drive t2 (but wait, t2 is now in l2_2 after step 10. Wait, no. Wait, in step 8, t2 is driven to l2_1. Then in step 9, loaded p2, then driven to l2_2 (step 10), and unloaded there. So after step 10, t2 is in l2_2. But p1 is in l2_5. To get p1, we need a truck in c2 to move it. The only truck in c2 is t2. So after step 10, t2 is in l2_2. We need to drive t2 to l2_5 to pick up p1.

But wait, the steps for p2 are done, but after that, t2 is in l2_2. So after step 11 (unload p2 at l2_2), t2 is in l2_2, empty. Then, to handle p1:

13. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_5 (where p1 is located).
    - Action: drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
14. Load p1 into t2 at l2_5.
    - Action: loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
15. Drive t2 to l2_1 (airport).
    - Action: drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
16. Unload p1 at l2_1.
    - Action: unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
17. Load p1 into airplane a2 (which is at l2_1).
    - Action: loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
18. Fly a2 to l1_1 (c1's airport).
    - Action: flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
19. Unload p1 at l1_1 (this satisfies the constraint).
    - Action: unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
20. Now, to get p1 back to c2. Load p1 into airplane a1 (which is at l1_1 after step 6? Wait, no: a1 was flown to l2_1 in step 6. After that, a1 is at l2_1. Wait, step 6: fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1. So a1 is now at l2_1. So after step 6, a1 is in l2_1, and after step 18, a2 is in l1_1. So, in step 19, p1 is in l1_1. To get it back to c2, we need to use another airplane. a2 is now at l1_1 (since we flew a2 there in step 18). So:

21. Load p1 into a2 at l1_1.
    - Action: loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
22. Fly a2 back to l2_1.
    - Action: flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
23. Unload p1 at l2_1.
    - Action: unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
24. Now, drive t2 (which is at l2_1 after step 15? Wait, no: after step 15, t2 was driven to l2_1. Then steps 16-24: after step 15, t2 is at l2_1. Then step 16 is unloading p1 there. Then t2 is still at l2_1. So after step 23, p1 is at l2_1. So we need to load it into t2 and drive to l2_4.

25. Load p1 into t2 at l2_1.
    - Action: loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
26. Drive t2 to l2_4.
    - Action: drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
27. Unload p1 at l2_4.
    - Action: unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

But this seems very long. Let's check for possible optimizations. For example, maybe combining steps where possible. Also, the order in which we handle p1 and p2 might affect the plan length.

Alternative approach: handle p1's movement first to satisfy the constraint earlier, which might allow some steps to be reused.

Let's try:

1. Move p1 from l2_5 to l2_1 using t2.

But t2 starts in l2_4. So drive t2 to l2_5, load p1, drive to l2_1.

Actions:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
3. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
5. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
6. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (now p1 is in l1_1, satisfying the constraint)
7. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
8. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (assuming a1 is still in l1_1. Wait, initial state says a1 is in l1_1. So if we haven't moved a1 yet, then yes. But later, when moving p2, we might need a1 to carry p2. So if we first handle p1's transport, then use a1 for p2.

So after step 8, p1 is loaded into a1, then fly to l2_1:

9. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
10. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
11. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (assuming t2 is back at l2_1. But after step 3, t2 is at l2_1. Then in step 4, unload p1. So t2 remains at l2_1. Then steps 5-10: a2 flies to l1_1, then p1 is loaded into a1 and flown back. Then unload at l2_1. Then load into t2 (still at l2_1) and drive to l2_4.

12. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
13. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

That's 13 steps for p1. Then for p2:

p2 is in l1_4 (c1). Need to get to l2_2 (c2). Use t1 in c1, drive to l1_4, load, drive to l1_1, load into a1 (but a1 is in l2_1 after step 9. Wait, after step 9, a1 is flown to l2_1, so it's no longer in l1_1. So this approach might not work because we need a1 to carry p2 from l1_1 to l2_1. But if a1 is already in l2_1 (after step 9), then we can't use it again unless we fly it back. Hmm. That complicates things.

Alternative plan: use a different airplane. Wait, there's a2. But a2 is in l2_1 initially. Wait, initial state says "Package a2 is in location l2_1". Again, that's probably a typo. The user probably meant "Airplane a2 is in location l2_1".

So airplanes a1 (l1_1) and a2 (l2_1) initially.

So when moving p1 from l1_1 back to c2, we can use a2. Because after step 6, a2 is in l1_1. Then, we can load p1 into a2 and fly back to l2_1.

So revising the steps:

For p1:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2 (t2 moves to p1)
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
3. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
5. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (a2 is initially at l2_1)
6. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (now p1 is in l1_1)
7. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (satisfies constraint)
8. Now, to return p1 to c2, use a2 again. Load p1 into a2 at l1_1.
9. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
10. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
11. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (t2 is already at l2_1 from step 3)
12. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
13. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

Now, for p2:

p2 is in l1_4 (c1). Need to get to l2_2 (c2). Use t1 (in l1_3) to pick it up, drive to l1_1, load into a1, fly to l2_1, unload, then use t2 (if available) to drive to l2_2. But t2 is in l2_4 after step 13. So need to drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1 again. But that's extra steps. Alternatively, use another truck? But there's only t2 in c2. So steps:

14. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1 (t1 moves to p2)
15. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
16. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
17. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
18. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
19. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
20. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
21. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2 (t2 is at l2_4 after step 13)
22. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
23. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
24. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

This totals 24 steps. But maybe there's a way to optimize. For example, after step 13, t2 is at l2_4. For p2's transport, after step 20 (p2 in l2_1), we need to drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1 again (step 21). But maybe if we can rearrange the order of handling p1 and p2.

Alternatively, process p2 first, then p1. Let's see:

Processing p2 first:

1. In c1: drive t1 to l1_4, load p2, drive to l1_1, load into a1, fly to l2_1.
2. Unload p2, drive t2 to l2_1 (from l2_4), load, drive to l2_2.

Then for p1:

3. Drive t2 back to l2_5 (from l2_2), load p1, drive to l2_1, load into a2, fly to l1_1 (meet constraint), then back to l2_1, then drive to l2_4.

But this might require more steps. Let's outline:

p2 steps:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1
2. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
3. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
4. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
5. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
6. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
7. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
8. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
9. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
10. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
11. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

Now p2 is done. For p1:

12. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
13. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
14. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
15. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
16. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
17. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
18. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (constraint met)
19. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
20. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
21. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
22. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
23. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
24. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

This also takes 24 steps. Not better.

Is there a way to combine some steps? For instance, when moving p1 back to c2, can we use the same airplane that brought p2? Let's see.

Wait, after p2 is flown to l2_1 using a1, then a1 is at l2_1. So if we need to fly p1 back from l1_1 to l2_1, we could use a1 if it's available. But a1 is in l2_1 after step 6. To use it again, we need to fly it back to l1_1. But that would require an empty flight. Let's see.

Alternatively, when handling p1's return, use a1. So after step 6, a1 is in l2_1. If we fly a1 back to l1_1 empty, then load p1 into it. But that's two extra steps. Not efficient.

Alternatively, use a2. a2 starts in l2_1. So to get a2 to l1_1, we need to fly it there. But initially, a2 is at l2_1. So steps for p1:

After step 11 (p2 is done), handle p1:

12. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2 (t2 is at l2_2 after step 10)
13. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
14. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
15. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
16. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
17. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
18. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (constraint met)
19. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (a1 is at l2_1 after step 6. Wait, no. a1 was flown to l2_1 in step 6, so it's there. So to load p1 into a1, we need a1 to be at l1_1. But a1 is at l2_1. So we need to fly a1 back to l1_1. But that's another step. Not ideal.

Hmm. This is getting complicated. Let's think of the minimal steps required.

The key is to ensure that p1 passes through l1_1. So p1 must be moved from c2 to c1 and then back. The optimal plan would minimize the number of steps by combining movements where possible.

Let's try to model the plan with the fewest steps.

For p2:

1. t1 moves to p2 (l1_4), loads, drives to l1_1, unloads.
2. Load p2 into a1, fly to l2_1.
3. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1, load p2, drive to l2_2, unload.

That's 7 actions for p2.

For p1:

4. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_5, load p1, drive to l2_1, unload.
5. Load p1 into a2, fly to l1_1 (constraint met), unload.
6. Load p1 into a2 (assuming a2 is at l1_1 now), fly back to l2_1.
7. Load p1 into t2 (which is at l2_1), drive to l2_4, unload.

That's 7 actions for p1. Total 14 actions. Let's check:

Wait, let's outline:

p2's steps:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1
2. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
3. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
4. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
5. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
6. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
7. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
8. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
9. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
10. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
11. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

Now, for p1:

12. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2 (t2 is at l2_2 after step 10)
13. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
14. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
15. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
16. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
17. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
18. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (constraint met)
19. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
20. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
21. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
22. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (t2 is at l2_1 after step 14)
23. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
24. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

Still 24 steps. Is there a smarter way? Maybe not using airplanes for both legs of p1's trip. For example, after flying p1 to l1_1, use another airplane to take it back. But there's only a1 and a2. a1 is at l2_1 after step 6. a2 is flown to l1_1 in step 17, so after step 18, a2 is at l1_1. So to fly back, use a2 again. So steps 19-20 are loading and flying a2 back. That works.

Alternatively, after p1 is in l1_1, load it into a1 which is at l2_1. But how? a1 is at l2_1. So to get a1 to l1_1, we'd need to fly it there empty, which adds steps. So probably not better.

Another idea: when moving p2, after a1 is at l2_1 (step 6), can we use a1 to carry p1 back? For example:

After step 6, a1 is at l2_1. Then, when p1 is flown to l1_1 via a2, and then needs to return, use a1 to carry it back. But a1 is in l2_1. So to do that:

- Fly a1 from l2_1 to l1_1 (empty), then load p1, fly back. But that adds two steps (fly a1 to l1_1, then fly back with p1). That's more steps than using a2.

Alternatively, after step 18 (p1 in l1_1), if a1 is in l2_1, can we use a different airplane? No, only a2 is there. So using a2 is the way to go.

Another optimization: when t2 is moving p2 to l2_2 (step 10), perhaps after unloading p2, drive t2 directly to l2_5 to pick up p1 instead of returning to l2_1. Let's see:

After step 11 (unload p2 at l2_2), t2 is at l2_2. Then:

12. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
13. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
14. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
15. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
16. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
17. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
18. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (constraint met)
19. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
20. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
21. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
22. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
23. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
24. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

Same number of steps. 

Is there any way to reduce steps? For example, combining the movement of t2. After unloading p2 at l2_2 (step 11), instead of driving to l2_5, could we have t2 move from l2_2 to l2_5 directly? Yes, but that's still one action.

Alternatively, maybe the initial approach can be adjusted. Let's think about the original plan I had with 27 steps and see where optimizations are possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the optimal plan is 24 steps. But maybe there's a smarter way. Let's think again.

Wait, what if we use a different airplane for the return trip? For example, when p1 is in l1_1, instead of using a2 to fly back, use a1 which is already in l2_1. But to do that, we need to get a1 back to l1_1. But a1 is in l2_1 after transporting p2. So after step 6 (fly a1 to l2_1), a1 is there. To use it again for p1, fly a1 back to l1_1 empty, then load p1 and fly back. That would add steps:

After step 6:

7. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1 (empty)
8. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
9. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
10. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

But this would be steps 7-10 for p1's return, which is four steps instead of the previous three (steps 19-21 in the previous plan). So that's worse.

Another idea: when flying p1 to l1_1, use the same airplane that will later carry it back. So using a2 to take p1 to l1_1, then a2 is there, so we can use it to bring it back. That's what we did earlier.

So the initial plan for p1 requires steps 16-21 (fly a2 to l1_1, unload, load, fly back, unload). That's six steps for p1's round trip.

Alternatively, after step 18 (p1 in l1_1), perhaps there's a way to combine steps. But I don't see it.

Another observation: the constraint is that p1 must be in l1_1 in at least one state. So the earliest this can happen is when p1 is unloaded there. So any plan must include that step.

Another possible optimization: when moving p1 to l1_1, use the same airplane that is already in l2_1. Wait, but airplanes are in different cities. So initial airplanes are a1 in l1_1, a2 in l2_1.

So to move p1 from l2_1 to l1_1, use a2. Then, to bring it back, use a2 again. Which is what we did.

Hmm. I think the minimal steps are 24. But perhaps there's a way to reduce it further by interleaving steps for p1 and p2.

For example, after step 6 (fly a1 to l2_1 with p2), then use a1 to fly back to l1_1 with p1. But a1 is in l2_1 after step 6. So:

For p1:

7. loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 (but p1 is in l2_5 at the start. No, that's not possible. p1 is in l2_5 initially.

Wait, after step 6, p2 is in l2_1, and a1 is there. p1 is still in l2_5. So perhaps while handling p2's transport, also handle p1's movement.

But they are in different cities. Let me think.

Alternatively, process p1 first. Get p1 to l1_1 early on, which satisfies the constraint, then handle p2. Maybe this allows some steps to be shared.

Let's try:

1. Handle p1's movement to l1_1:

   a. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2
   b. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
   c. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
   d. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
   e. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
   f. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
   g. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (constraint met)
   
Now p1 is in l1_1. To get it back, load into a1 (which is in l1_1):

   h. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
   i. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
   j. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
   k. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (t2 is at l2_1 after step c)
   l. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
   m. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

That's 13 steps for p1. Now, handle p2:

n. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1
o. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
p. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
q. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
r. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (a1 is in l2_1 after step i. Oops, no. After step i, a1 is in l2_1. So step r can't load p2 into a1 at l1_1 because a1 is in l2_1. So this approach doesn't work. We need to use another airplane. a2 is in l1_1 after step g. So:

After step g, a2 is in l1_1. So for p2:

r. loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
s. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
t. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
u. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (t2 is at l2_4 after step l. Wait, no. After step l, t2 is at l2_4. So to load p2, need t2 to be at l2_1. So:

u. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
v. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
w. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
x. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

This adds 8 steps for p2, making total steps 21 (m steps for p1 + x steps for p2). But let's count:

Steps 1-13: steps a to m (13 steps for p1)
Steps n to x: 8 steps for p2)
Total 21 steps. But let's check if this works.

After step m, t2 is in l2_4. For p2:

n. drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_4
o. load p2
p. drive t1 to l1_1
q. unload p2 at l1_1
r. load p2 into a2 (which is in l1_1 after step g)
s. fly a2 to l2_1
t. unload p2
u. drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1
v. load p2 into t2
w. drive to l2_2
x. unload

So steps n to x: 8 steps. Total plan: 13 +8 =21 steps. That's better than 24. But does this work?

Let's verify:

After step g: p1 is in l1_1 (unloaded from a2). a2 is in l1_1.

Step h: load p1 into a1 (but a1 is in l1_1 initially. Wait, initial state has a1 in l1_1. So after step h, a1 is loaded with p1, then flown to l2_1 in step i. Then unloaded in j. So a1 is now in l2_1. 

For p2's steps:

After step q: p2 is in l1_1. Then step r loads p2 into a2 (which is in l1_1 after step g). Then fly a2 to l2_1 (step s). So a2 is now in l2_1. Unload p2 (step t). Then drive t2 from l2_4 (after step m) to l2_1 (step u). Load p2 (v), drive to l2_2 (w), unload (x). 

Yes, this works. So total steps are 21. Let's list them all:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
3. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
5. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
6. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
7. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
8. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
9. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
10. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
11. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
12. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
13. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
14. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1
15. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
16. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
17. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
18. loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
19. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
20. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
21. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
22. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
23. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
24. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

Wait, this is 24 steps again. Because steps 14-24 are 11 steps. So 13 +11 =24. Maybe I miscounted earlier.

Alternatively, after step 13 (unload p1 at l2_4), proceed with p2:

14. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1
15. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
16. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
17. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
18. loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (a2 is at l1_1 after step 6)
19. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
20. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
21. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2 (t2 is at l2_4 after step 13)
22. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
23. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
24. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

Yes, 24 steps. So this seems unavoidable.

But wait, after step 6, a2 is at l1_1. In step 18, we load p2 into a2. But a2 is already carrying p1? No, after step 6, a2 flew to l1_1 with p1, which was unloaded in step 7. So a2 is empty in l1_1. So yes, step 18 is valid.

Thus, the minimal plan is 24 steps. However, perhaps there's a way to reduce steps by reusing the same truck movements or airplane flights for both packages. For example, when flying a2 back to l2_1 with p1, maybe also carry p2. But p2 is in l1_1 after step 17. So if we can load both p1 and p2 into the same airplane, but I don't think the actions allow multiple packages per action. Each load action is for one package. So to carry both, you'd need two load actions and two unload actions, which would increase steps.

Alternatively, after step 17 (p2 in l1_1), can we load both p1 and p2 into a2 and fly them together? But each load action is per package. So:

18. loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
19. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (but p1 is in l1_1 after step 7)
20. fly a2 to l2_1
21. unload both. But each unload is a separate action.

This would require steps:

18. load p2 into a2
19. load p1 into a2
20. fly to l2_1
21. unload p2
22. unload p1

That's 5 steps instead of 4 (original steps 18-21: load p2, fly, unload p2, load p1, fly, unload p1). Wait, no. Original plan for p1 and p2's flights would be:

For p2:

18. load p2 into a2
19. fly a2 to l2_1
20. unload p2

For p1:

8. load p1 into a1
9. fly to l2_1
10. unload p1

But in the new approach, combining both into a2:

18. load p2 into a2
19. load p1 into a2
20. fly to l2_1
21. unload p2
22. unload p1

This saves one flight action (one fly instead of two), but adds a load and unload step. Total steps: 5 vs 4+4=8. So saves 3 steps. So this could reduce the total plan length.

But is this allowed? The problem doesn't state that airplanes can carry multiple packages, but the actions are defined for loading and unloading individual packages. So each package must be loaded and unloaded separately. But if the airplane can carry multiple packages, then this is possible. However, the action definitions don't specify that. For example, the effect of loadairplane is that p is in ap. It doesn't say that other packages are affected. So I think each package must be loaded and unloaded individually. Therefore, combining them would require separate actions. So even if the airplane can carry multiple packages, the actions must be per package.

Therefore, this approach would save one fly action but add one load and one unload. So steps would be:

Original for p2's flight and p1's flight:

For p2:

18. loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
19. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
20. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

For p1's return flight:

8. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
9. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
10. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

Total steps: 6 actions.

Combined approach:

18. loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
19. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
20. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
21. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
22. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

Total steps: 5 actions. Saves one step.

But in this case, the combined approach saves one action (fly instead of two). But is this allowed? The actions are per package. The airplane can carry both packages, but each must be loaded and unloaded separately. So the combined approach is valid. So this reduces the total steps by one.

So integrating this into the plan:

After step 7 (p1 in l1_1, a2 in l1_1), proceed:

8. loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (p2 is in l1_1 after step 17)
9. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
10. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
11. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
12. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

Then, for p1's truck transport:

13. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
14. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
15. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

For p2's truck transport:

16. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
17. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
18. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

But wait, t2 is at l2_1 after step 3 (drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2). Then after step 14, it's driven to l2_4. Then in step 16, need to drive t2 back to l2_1 again. Which would require:

After step 15 (t2 at l2_4), steps 16 would need to drive t2 back to l2_1:

16. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
17. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
18. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
19. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

So this approach saves one fly action but adds more truck movements. Let's count the total steps.

Original steps for p1 and p2's flights: 6 actions (steps 18-20 and 8-10)
Combined steps: 5 actions (steps 8-12)

But truck steps increase:

After combining, for p1 and p2:

After step 15 (unload p1 at l2_4), to handle p2:

16. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
17. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
18. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
19. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

So that's 4 steps. While in the original plan, after step 20 (unload p2), t2 is at l2_1 and can drive to l2_2. So original steps for p2's truck transport were:

21. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
22. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
23. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

So 3 steps. So combining flights saves 1 flight action but adds 1 truck action. So net zero.

Total steps would be:

Original plan with combining flights:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
3. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
5. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
6. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
7. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
8. loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (p2 is brought to l1_1 via steps 14-17)
9. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
10. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
11. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
12. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
13. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
14. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
15. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
16. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1
17. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
18. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
19. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
20. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
21. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
22. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
23. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

This is 23 steps. But I'm getting lost in the ordering. Let's try to outline the entire plan with the combined flight:

Full plan:

For p1's initial movement to l1_1:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
3. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
5. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
6. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
7. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (constraint met)

For p2's movement to l1_1:

8. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1
9. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
10. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
11. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

Combined flight for p1 and p2:

12. loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
13. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
14. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
15. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
16. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

Transport p1 to l2_4:

17. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (t2 is at l2_1 from step 3)
18. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
19. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

Transport p2 to l2_2:

20. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (but after step 18, t2 is at l2_4. So need to drive back)
21. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
22. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
23. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
24. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

This gives 24 steps. But wait, after step 18, t2 is at l2_4. So steps 21-24 are needed. But in the original plan, after step 3, t2 is at l2_1. Then steps 17-19 move it to l2_4. Then steps 21-24 move it back. So this approach doesn't save steps.

In conclusion, the minimal plan length seems to be 24 steps. However, considering the time I've spent trying to optimize and not finding a shorter path, I'll proceed to write the plan with the steps outlined earlier, ensuring that all preconditions and constraints are met, especially that p1 is in l1_1 at least once.
