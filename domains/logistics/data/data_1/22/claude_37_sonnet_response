Let me first understand the problem and the initial state:

Initial State:
- Location l1_1, l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5 are in city c1
- Location l2_1, l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5 are in city c2
- Package t1 is in location l1_2 (this seems like a mistake, t1 should be a truck, not a package)
- Package t2 is in location l2_2 (same mistake)
- Package p1 is in location l2_2
- Package p2 is in location l1_2
- Package a1 is in location l1_1 (another mistake, a1 should be an airplane)
- Package a2 is in location l2_1 (also a mistake)

Let me assume the correct initial state:
- Location l1_1, l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5 are in city c1
- Location l2_1, l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5 are in city c2
- Truck t1 is in location l1_2
- Truck t2 is in location l2_2
- Package p1 is in location l2_2
- Package p2 is in location l1_2
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

Goals:
- Package p1 should be in location l2_5
- Package p2 should be in location l2_4

Constraints:
- At some point, either package p2 should be in location l1_4 or package p1 should be in location l2_1.

Alright, let's plan:

For package p1, which is currently in location l2_2, we need to move it to location l2_5. Both locations are in city c2, so we can use truck t2 which is already in location l2_2.

For package p2, which is currently in location l1_2, we need to move it to location l2_4. Since the locations are in different cities, we'll need to use an airplane. We can use truck t1 to move p2 to the airport l1_1, then use airplane a1 to fly it to airport l2_1, and finally use truck t2 to move it to location l2_4.

However, there's a constraint: At some point, either p2 should be in location l1_4 or p1 should be in location l2_1. 

Let's see which one is more convenient:
- For p2 to be in location l1_4, we'd need to move it from l1_2 to l1_4 using truck t1, then back to l1_1 to fly it to city c2.
- For p1 to be in location l2_1, we'd need to move it from l2_2 to l2_1 using truck t2, which is a simple detour en route to l2_5.

The second option seems more efficient.

Here's the plan:

1. "loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2": Load package p1 in truck t2 at location l2_2.
2. "drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2": Drive truck t2 from location l2_2 to the airport l2_1 in city c2.
3. "unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1": Unload package p1 from truck t2 at location l2_1. (this fulfills the constraint)
4. "loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1": Load package p1 in truck t2 at location l2_1.
5. "drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2": Drive truck t2 from location l2_1 to location l2_5 in city c2.
6. "unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5": Unload package p1 from truck t2 at location l2_5.

7. "loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2": Load package p2 in truck t1 at location l1_2.
8. "drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1": Drive truck t1 from location l1_2 to the airport l1_1 in city c1.
9. "unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1": Unload package p2 from truck t1 at location l1_1.
10. "loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1": Load package p2 in airplane a1 at location l1_1.
11. "flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1": Fly airplane a1 from airport l1_1 to airport l2_1.
12. "unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1": Unload package p2 from airplane a1 at location l2_1.

But wait, we need to use truck t2 to move p2 from airport l2_1 to location l2_4. But after step 6, truck t2 is in location l2_5. So, we need to add steps to move truck t2 from l2_5 back to l2_1, load p2, and drive to l2_4.

13. "drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2": Drive truck t2 from location l2_5 to location l2_1 in city c2.
14. "loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1": Load package p2 in truck t2 at location l2_1.
15. "drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2": Drive truck t2 from location l2_1 to location l2_4 in city c2.
16. "unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4": Unload package p2 from truck t2 at location l2_4.

This plan satisfies the constraint by having p1 in l2_1 after step 3.

But is there a more efficient plan? Actually, after thinking about it, I'm not sure if the current plan is the most efficient.

Let me analyze the actions needed more closely:

For package p1 (from l2_2 to l2_5):
- loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
- drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 (satisfying constraint)
- unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
- loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
- drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
- unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

For package p2 (from l1_2 to l2_4):
- loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
- drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
- unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
- loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
- flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
- unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
- loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
- drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
- unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

The issue is that we need to move truck t2 from l2_5 (after delivering p1) to l2_1 (to pick up p2), which adds extra steps.

Actually, given the constraint and the goal, a more efficient plan might be to transport p2 first, satisfying the constraint by moving it through l1_4, and then transport p1:

For package p2 (from l1_2 to l2_4):
- loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
- drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1 (satisfying constraint)
- drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
- unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
- loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
- flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
- unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
- loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
- drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
- unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

For package p1 (from l2_2 to l2_5):
- drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2
- loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
- drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
- unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

In this plan, we avoid having to move truck t2 from l2_5 to l2_1. Instead, we first deliver p2 to l2_4 (passing through l1_4 to satisfy the constraint), and then use truck t2 to deliver p1 from l2_2 to l2_5.

But actually, I'm not sure this plan is most efficient either. Let's enumerate both plans and count the steps:

Plan 1 (moving p1 first, satisfying constraint by having p1 in l2_1):
1. "loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2": Load package p1 in truck t2 at location l2_2.
2. "drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2": Drive truck t2 from location l2_2 to the airport l2_1 in city c2.
3. "unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1": Unload package p1 from truck t2 at location l2_1. (this fulfills the constraint)
4. "loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1": Load package p1 in truck t2 at location l2_1.
5. "drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2": Drive truck t2 from location l2_1 to location l2_5 in city c2.
6. "unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5": Unload package p1 from truck t2 at location l2_5.
7. "drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2": Drive truck t2 from location l2_5 to location l2_1 in city c2.
8. "loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2": Load package p2 in truck t1 at location l1_2.
9. "drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1": Drive truck t1 from location l1_2 to the airport l1_1 in city c1.
10. "unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1": Unload package p2 from truck t1 at location l1_1.
11. "loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1": Load package p2 in airplane a1 at location l1_1.
12. "flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1": Fly airplane a1 from airport l1_1 to airport l2_1.
13. "unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1": Unload package p2 from airplane a1 at location l2_1.
14. "loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1": Load package p2 in truck t2 at location l2_1.
15. "drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2": Drive truck t2 from location l2_1 to location l2_4 in city c2.
16. "unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4": Unload package p2 from truck t2 at location l2_4.

That's 16 steps (omitting comments).

Plan 2 (moving p2 first, satisfying constraint by having p2 in l1_4):
1. "loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2": Load package p2 in truck t1 at location l1_2.
2. "drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1": Drive truck t1 from location l1_2 to location l1_4 in city c1. (satisfying constraint)
3. "drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1": Drive truck t1 from location l1_4 to the airport l1_1 in city c1.
4. "unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1": Unload package p2 from truck t1 at location l1_1.
5. "loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1": Load package p2 in airplane a1 at location l1_1.
6. "flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1": Fly airplane a1 from airport l1_1 to airport l2_1.
7. "unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1": Unload package p2 from airplane a1 at location l2_1.
8. "loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1": Load package p2 in truck t2 at location l2_1.
9. "drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2": Drive truck t2 from location l2_1 to location l2_4 in city c2.
10. "unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4": Unload package p2 from truck t2 at location l2_4.
11. "drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2": Drive truck t2 from location l2_4 to location l2_2 in city c2.
12. "loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2": Load package p1 in truck t2 at location l2_2.
13. "drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2": Drive truck t2 from location l2_2 to location l2_5 in city c2.
14. "unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5": Unload package p1 from truck t2 at location l2_5.

That's 14 steps (omitting comments).

It appears that Plan 2 is more efficient, as it has 14 steps compared to 16 steps in Plan 1. Let's go with Plan 2.

Wait, let me revisit this logic again. Actually, I think I miswrote "unloadtruck" and "loadtruck" when the package was already inside the truck. Let me correct it here. In steps 3 and 4 of Plan 1, we have:
3. "unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1": Unload package p1 from truck t2 at location l2_1. (this fulfills the constraint)
4. "loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1": Load package p1 in truck t2 at location l2_1.

These two steps might be unnecessary when p1 is already in truck t2 by the time it reaches l2_1. But I'm adding these steps explicitly to make sure that p1 is physically inside the location l2_1 at some point (to guarantee that the constraint is satisfied)

Let me re-analyze Plan 2 (moving p2 first, satisfying constraint by having p2 in l1_4):
1. "loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2": Load package p2 in truck t1 at location l1_2.
2. "drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1": Drive truck t1 from location l1_2 to location l1_4 in city c1.
3. "unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4": Unload package p2 from truck t1 at location l1_4. (satisfying constraint)
4. "loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4": Load package p2 in truck t1 at location l1_4.
5. "drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1": Drive truck t1 from location l1_4 to the airport l1_1 in city c1.
6. "unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1": Unload package p2 from truck t1 at location l1_1.
7. "loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1": Load package p2 in airplane a1 at location l1_1.
8. "flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1": Fly airplane a1 from airport l1_1 to airport l2_1.
9. "unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1": Unload package p2 from airplane a1 at location l2_1.
10. "loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1": Load package p2 in truck t2 at location l2_1.
11. "drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2": Drive truck t2 from location l2_1 to location l2_4 in city c2.
12. "unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4": Unload package p2 from truck t2 at location l2_4.
13. "drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2": Drive truck t2 from location l2_4 to location l2_2 in city c2.
14. "loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2": Load package p1 in truck t2 at location l2_2.
15. "drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2": Drive truck t2 from location l2_2 to location l2_5 in city c2.
16. "unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5": Unload package p1 from truck t2 at location l2_5.

That's 16 steps (omitting comments).

I need to add two steps (3 and 4) to ensure p2 is in location l1_4 at some point to satisfy the constraint. This is similar to what I did in Plan 1. So both plans have 16 steps.

Actually, let's reconsider. I think I'm adding unnecessary steps (3 and 4).

The constraint is: "At least one of the following conditions is true: "Package p2 is in location l1_4", "Package p1 is in location l2_1""

It's asking if at any state in the plan, at least one of these conditions is true. It's not asking if we actively change p1 or p2's location to satisfy the constraint.

When driving a truck with a package in it, the package's location doesn't change unless you unload it. So, in Plan 2, when I drive truck t1 from l1_2 to l1_4 with p2 inside, p2 is still inside the truck, not in location l1_4. To make sure that p2 is in location l1_4, I need to unload it there. 

Let me rethink.

I think I need to be more precise about what "p2 is in location l1_4" means. It means that the package p2 is physically placed in the location l1_4, not just that the truck containing p2 is in l1_4. If this is the case, then I do need to perform two actions (unload and then load) to ensure p2 is in l1_4 at some point.

Given that a package's location is either a specific location, a truck, or an airplane, "p2 is in location l1_4" means that p2 is physically at l1_4, not inside a truck or an airplane.

So, for Plan 2, the steps I've enumerated are accurate to ensure that p2 is in l1_4 at some point.

Alright, both plans have 16 steps. It doesn't seem to matter which one I go with.

But wait, I just realized I haven't been comparing these plans fairly. I've been missing a key detail: When a package is already being carried by a vehicle (truck or airplane), the package's location is defined as being inside the vehicle, not at the location the vehicle is in.

So, when I say "package p2 is in location l1_4", it means that p2 is physically at l1_4, not inside a truck or an airplane. For p2 to be in l1_4, I need to unload it from the truck there.

Similarly, for p1 to be in l2_1, I need to unload it from truck t2 at l2_1.

Given this, both Plan 1 and Plan 2 are accurate as enumerated, and both have 16 steps. Neither appears to be more efficient than the other.

However, I think there's one more optimization I can make in Plan 1. In steps 3-4 of Plan 1, I unnecessarily unload and load the package p1 from the same truck in the same location. While I did this to ensure the constraint was satisfied, I could directly satisfy the constraint by carrying p1 via the aircraft:

Modified Plan 1:
1. "loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2": Load package p1 in truck t2 at location l2_2.
2. "drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2": Drive truck t2 from location l2_2 to the airport l2_1 in city c2.
3. "unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1": Unload package p1 from truck t2 at location l2_1. (this fulfills the constraint)
4. "loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1": Load package p1 in airplane a2 at location l2_1.
5. "flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1": Fly airplane a2 from location l2_1 to location l1_1.
6. "unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1": Unload package p1 from airplane a2 at location l1_1.
7. "loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1": Load package p1 in airplane a1 at location l1_1.
8. "flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1": Fly airplane a1 from location l1_1 to location l2_1.
9. "unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1": Unload package p1 from airplane a1 at location l2_1.
10. "loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1": Load package p1 in truck t2 at location l2_1.
11. "drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2": Drive truck t2 from location l2_1 to location l2_5 in city c2.
12. "unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5": Unload package p1 from truck t2 at location l2_5.
13. "drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2": Drive truck t2 from location l2_5 to location l2_1 in city c2.
14. "loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2": Load package p2 in truck t1 at location l1_2.
15. "drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1": Drive truck t1 from location l1_2 to the airport l1_1 in city c1.
16. "unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1": Unload package p2 from truck t1 at location l1_1.
17. "loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1": Load package p2 in airplane a1 at location l1_1.
18. "flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1": Fly airplane a1 from airport l1_1 to airport l2_1.
19. "unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1": Unload package p2 from airplane a1 at location l2_1.
20. "loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1": Load package p2 in truck t2 at location l2_1.
21. "drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2": Drive truck t2 from location l2_1 to location l2_4 in city c2.
22. "unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4": Unload package p2 from truck t2 at location l2_4.

This modified Plan 1 is much longer and less efficient.

Actually, I just realized I'm overcomplicating things. 

Let's consider a simpler approach:

For package p1, which is in location l2_2, we want to move it to location l2_5. Both of these locations are in city c2. We can use truck t2 (which is also in l2_2) for this.

For package p2, which is in location l1_2, we want to move it to location l2_4. This requires moving between cities, so we'll need to use an airplane. We can use truck t1 (which is in l1_2) to move the package to the airport l1_1, then use airplane a1 to fly it to the airport l2_1, and finally use truck t2 to transport it to l2_4.

The constraint is that either p2 should be in location l1_4 or p1 should be in location l2_1 at some point. Let's choose the easier option: having p1 in l2_1. We can do this by moving p1 from l2_2 to l2_5 via l2_1.

Using this approach, our plan would be:

1. "loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2": Load package p1 in truck t2 at location l2_2.
2. "drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2": Drive truck t2 from location l2_2 to location l2_1 in city c2.
3. "unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1": Unload package p1 from truck t2 at location l2_1. (this fulfills the constraint)
4. "loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1": Load package p1 in truck t2 at location l2_1.
5. "drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2": Drive truck t2 from location l2_1 to location l2_5 in city c2.
6. "unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5": Unload package p1 from truck t2 at location l2_5.

7. "drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2": Drive truck t2 from location l2_5 to location l2_1 in city c2.
8. "loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2": Load package p2 in truck t1 at location l1_2.
9. "drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1": Drive truck t1 from location l1_2 to location l1_1 in city c1.
10. "unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1": Unload package p2 from truck t1 at location l1_1.
11. "loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1": Load package p2 in airplane a1 at location l1_1.
12. "flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1": Fly airplane a1 from location l1_1 to location l2_1.
13. "unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1": Unload package p2 from airplane a1 at location l2_1.
14. "loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1": Load package p2 in truck t2 at location l2_1.
15. "drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2": Drive truck t2 from location l2_1 to location l2_4 in city c2.
16. "unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4": Unload package p2 from truck t2 at location l2_4.

That's 16 steps. Let's analyze the logic:

- We use truck t2 to move package p1 from l2_2 to l2_5, stopping by l2_1 to satisfy the constraint.
- We then use truck t2 to go back to l2_1, load the package p2 (which was flown from city c1), and transport it to l2_4.

Wait, let me take another approach. Instead of moving p1 first, let's see if moving p2 first is more efficient:

1. "loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2": Load package p2 in truck t1 at location l1_2.
2. "drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1": Drive truck t1 from location l1_2 to location l1_4 in city c1.
3. "unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4": Unload package p2 from truck t1 at location l1_4. (fulfilling the constraint)
4. "loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4": Load package p2 in truck t1 at location l1_4.
5. "drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1": Drive truck t1 from location l1_4 to location l1_1 in city c1.
6. "unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1": Unload package p2 from truck t1 at location l1_1.
7. "loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1": Load package p2 in airplane a1 at location l1_1.
8. "flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1": Fly airplane a1 from location l1_1 to location l2_1.
9. "unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1": Unload package p2 from airplane a1 at location l2_1.
10. "loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1": Load package p2 in truck t2 at location l2_1.
11. "drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2": Drive truck t2 from location l2_1 to location l2_4 in city c2.
12. "unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4": Unload package p2 from truck t2 at location l2_4.

13. "drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2": Drive truck t2 from location l2_4 to location l2_2 in city c2.
14. "loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2": Load package p1 in truck t2 at location l2_2.
15. "drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2": Drive truck t2 from location l2_2 to location l2_5 in city c2.
16. "unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5": Unload package p1 from truck t2 at location l2_5.

This is 16 steps as well. 

Regardless of which package we deliver first, the plan length seems to be the same. Both plans are valid and have the same number of steps. Let's go with the plan of moving p1 first, as it was the first plan I conceived:

1. "loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2": Load package p1 in truck t2 at location l2_2.
2. "drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2": Drive truck t2 from location l2_2 to location l2_1 in city c2.
3. "unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1": Unload package p1 from truck t2 at location l2_1. (this fulfills the constraint)
4. "loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1": Load package p1 in truck t2 at location l2_1.
5. "drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2": Drive truck t2 from location l2_1 to location l2_5 in city c2.
6. "unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5": Unload package p1 from truck t2 at location l2_5.

7. "drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2": Drive truck t2 from location l2_5 to location l2_1 in city c2.
8. "loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2": Load package p2 in truck t1 at location l1_2.
9. "drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1": Drive truck t1 from location l1_2 to location l1_1 in city c1.
10. "unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1": Unload package p2 from truck t1 at location l1_1.
11. "loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1": Load package p2 in airplane a1 at location l1_1.
12. "flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1": Fly airplane a1 from location l1_1 to location l2_1.
13. "unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1": Unload package p2 from airplane a1 at location l2_1.
14. "loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1": Load package p2 in truck t2 at location l2_1.
15. "drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2": Drive truck t2 from location l2_1 to location l2_4 in city c2.
16. "unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4": Unload package p2 from truck t2 at location l2_4.

Wait, I made a typo in "loadairplane" vs "unloadairplane" for "unloadairplane p ap l". Let me correct it:

The second "loadairplane" in the description should be "unloadairplane":
"unloadairplane p ap l": Unload package p from airplane ap in location l.

So the complete, correct plan is:

1. "loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2": Load package p1 in truck t2 at location l2_2.
2. "drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2": Drive truck t2 from location l2_2 to location l2_1 in city c2.
3. "unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1": Unload package p1 from truck t2 at location l2_1. (this fulfills the constraint)
4. "loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1": Load package p1 in truck t2 at location l2_1.
5. "drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2": Drive truck t2 from location l2_1 to location l2_5 in city c2.
6. "unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5": Unload package p1 from truck t2 at location l2_5.

7. "drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2": Drive truck t2 from location l2_5 to location l2_1 in city c2.
8. "loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2": Load package p2 in truck t1 at location l1_2.
9. "drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1": Drive truck t1 from location l1_2 to location l1_1 in city c1.
10. "unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1": Unload package p2 from truck t1 at location l1_1.
11. "loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1": Load package p2 in airplane a1 at location l1_1.
12. "flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1": Fly airplane a1 from location l1_1 to location l2_1.
13. "unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1": Unload package p2 from airplane a1 at location l2_1.
14. "loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1": Load package p2 in truck t2 at location l2_1.
15. "drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2": Drive truck t2 from location l2_1 to location l2_4 in city c2.
16. "unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4": Unload package p2 from truck t2 at location l2_4.

Actually, I realized one more issue: the initial state says "Package t1 is in location l1_2" and "Package t2 is in location l2_2". I believe this is a mistake, and t1 and t2 should be trucks, not packages. In our plan, I've assumed t1 and t2 are trucks, which seems to be the intended semantics.

So to summarize, based on the assumption that t1 and t2 are trucks, a1 and a2 are airplanes, and p1 and p2 are packages, the plan is as described above, with 16 steps.

Ok, I think the final plan is:
1. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
2. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
3. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
4. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
5. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
6. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
7. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
8. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
9. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
10. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
11. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
12. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
13. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
14. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
15. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
16. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
