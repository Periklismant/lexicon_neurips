Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. First, I need to understand the initial state, the goal, and the constraints.

The initial state has two cities, c1 and c2, each with several locations. The key points here are the packages and their locations. 

Packages:
- p1 is in l2_2 (city c2)
- p2 is in l1_2 (city c1)
Trucks:
- t1 is in l1_2 (c1)
- t2 is in l2_2 (c2)
Airplanes:
- a1 is at l1_1 (airport in c1)
- a2 is at l2_1 (airport in c2)

The goal is to have p1 in l2_5 (c2) and p2 in l2_4 (c2). So both packages need to end up in different locations in city c2. But currently, p2 is in c1, so we need to move it from c1 to c2.

Constraints: At some point, either p2 is in l1_4 (c1) or p1 is in l2_1 (c2's airport). So the plan must pass through a state where one of these is true.

Let me start by figuring out how to get p2 from l1_2 (c1) to l2_4 (c2). Since cities are separate, we probably need an airplane to move between airports. But first, p2 is in l1_2. To get it to an airplane, we need a truck. Truck t1 is already in l1_2, so we can load p2 into t1. Then drive t1 to l1_1 (the airport in c1). Wait, but can the truck drive to the airport? Yes, since l1_1 is part of c1. So steps for p2:

1. Load p2 into t1 at l1_2.
2. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1.
3. Unload p2 at l1_1.
4. Load p2 into airplane a1 (which is already at l1_1).
5. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1 (c2's airport).
6. Unload p2 from a1 at l2_1.
Now, p2 is in l2_1. Then, we need to get it to l2_4. So use truck t2, which is in l2_2. Wait, but t2 is in l2_2. Maybe we need to drive t2 to l2_1 first? Wait, but initially, t2 is in l2_2. So steps for p2 after arriving at l2_1:

7. Load p2 into t2 at l2_1 (but t2 is in l2_2, so that's a problem). Oh, right. So perhaps after unloading p2 at l2_1, we need a truck in l2_1 to take it to l2_4. But the only truck in c2 is t2, which is in l2_2. So maybe we need to drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1 first.

Wait, but t2 is in l2_2. Let me think. Alternatively, maybe use another approach. Let's see:

For p2's journey from c1 to c2's l2_4:

- After flying to l2_1, we need a truck in l2_1 to transport it to l2_4. But t2 is in l2_2. So steps:

After step 6 (p2 is in l2_1), we need to get a truck to l2_1. But the only truck in c2 is t2. So drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1. Then load p2 into t2, drive to l2_4, unload.

So steps for p2:

6. Unload p2 from a1 at l2_1.
7. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1. (But can t2 drive from l2_2 to l2_1? Yes, since they are both in c2.)
Wait, but l2_1 is the airport. So drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2. Then load p2 into t2, then drive to l2_4, unload.

So steps 7-10 for p2:

7. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
8. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
9. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
10. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

That gets p2 to l2_4. But wait, in the initial state, t2 is in l2_2. So yes, step 7 is possible.

Now for p1. p1 starts in l2_2. We need to get it to l2_5. How? Use truck t2. But t2 is moving to l2_1 for p2. So perhaps after handling p2, we need to handle p1. But maybe there's a better way.

Wait, let's consider p1's path. p1 is in l2_2. We need to get it to l2_5. So possible steps:

Load p1 into t2 at l2_2, drive to l2_5, unload. But initially, t2 is in l2_2, so that's possible. So steps:

loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2

unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

But wait, but if we do this first, then t2 is in l2_5, which is in c2, so it can't help with moving p2. Because after moving t2 to l2_5, it's there, but then how to get it back to l2_1? That might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe handle p1 first.

But let's see. If we first move p1 to l2_5, then t2 is in l2_5. Then we need to drive t2 back to l2_2 to pick up p2's transport. But that's adding steps. Alternatively, perhaps handle p2 first, then use t2 for p1.

Wait, let's outline the steps again.

For p2:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (since t1 is there)
2. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 (drive to airport)
3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (now p2 is at airport)
4. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (since a1 is there)
5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (fly to c2's airport)
6. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (now p2 is at l2_1)
7. Now, need to move p2 from l2_1 to l2_4. So use t2. But t2 is in l2_2. So drive t2 to l2_1:
7. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
8. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
9. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
10. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

For p1:

p1 is in l2_2. We need to get it to l2_5. But t2 is in l2_2 initially. So perhaps:

11. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (but t2 is in l2_2, but after step 7, t2 is in l2_1. Wait, this is conflicting. Let me check the order.

Wait, steps for p2 require moving t2 from l2_2 to l2_1 (step7). Then, after that, t2 is in l2_1. So for p1, how to move it? Because p1 is in l2_2. So after t2 is moved to l2_1, we can't use it to pick up p1 from l2_2. So maybe we need to handle p1 before moving t2.

But how? Let's see:

If we first handle p1:

1. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
2. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
3. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

Then t2 is in l2_5. Then, for p2, we need to move t2 from l2_5 to l2_1. But that's a longer drive. So steps:

But after handling p1, t2 is in l2_5, so to get to l2_1, it needs to drive through l2_4, l2_3, etc. Wait, in the problem statement, the cities have locations l2_1 (airport), l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5. So the truck can drive between any locations in the same city. So from l2_5 to l2_1, perhaps via intermediate steps. But that would require multiple drive actions, which increases the plan length. So this might not be optimal.

Alternatively, maybe find a way to handle both packages with minimal steps.

Alternatively, perhaps use the airplane for p1. But p1 is in l2_2, which is not an airport. So to use an airplane, p1 would need to be transported to the airport l2_1 first. Then loaded into a2 (which is at l2_1). Then fly to another airport, but l2_5 isn't an airport. So that's not helpful. So maybe using the truck is better.

Wait, the goal is l2_5 for p1, which is in city c2. So using the truck is the way to go. So the optimal path for p1 is to load it into t2 in l2_2, drive to l2_5, unload. That's three actions. But if we do this before moving t2 for p2's transport, then after p1 is delivered, t2 is in l2_5, and we have to drive it back to l2_1 to get p2 from the airport. But that adds more steps.

Alternatively, handle p2 first, then p1. Let's see:

For p2:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
2. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
4. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
6. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (Wait, no. a1 is flown to l2_1. So unload from a1.)

Wait, the airplane a1 is initially at l1_1. So after flying to l2_1, a1 is there. So unload p2 from a1 at l2_1.

So step 6: unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1.

Then, to move p2 to l2_4, need t2. But t2 is in l2_2. So:

7. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
8. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
9. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
10. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

Now, after that, t2 is in l2_4. Then, to handle p1:

p1 is in l2_2. How to get it to l2_5. We need to get t2 back to l2_2 to load p1? Or perhaps there's another way.

Alternatively, after step 10, t2 is in l2_4. To get to l2_2, drive through l2_3 and l2_2. But that would take multiple steps. Or maybe from l2_4 drive to l2_5, but that's not helpful. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps use another truck? But there's only t2 in c2. So maybe:

After step 10, drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_5 (but that's not necessary unless we need to move p1). Wait, p1 is in l2_2, which is in c2. So perhaps after delivering p2, t2 is in l2_4. Then, drive t2 to l2_2 (but how? The locations are l2_1, l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5. So from l2_4, drive to l2_3, then l2_2. That's two drive actions. Then load p1 and drive to l2_5.

But that's adding steps. So maybe the initial approach of handling p1 first is better.

Wait, let's compare plan lengths.

Option 1: Handle p1 first.

Steps for p1 (3 steps):

1. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
2. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
3. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

Then steps for p2:

4. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
5. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
6. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
7. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
8. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
9. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
10. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2 (Wait, but after step 3, t2 is in l2_5. So driving from l2_5 to l2_4 is possible, but why? To get to l2_1, need to go through l2_4, l2_3, l2_2, l2_1. But that's multiple steps. So steps 10-13 would be:

10. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2
11. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2
12. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2
13. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
14. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
15. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
16. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

That's way too many steps. Not optimal. So handling p1 first is not optimal.

Option 2: Handle p2 first, then p1.

Steps for p2:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
2. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
4. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
6. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
7. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
8. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
9. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
10. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

Now, t2 is in l2_4. Now, handle p1:

11. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2
12. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2
13. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
14. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
15. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

That's 15 steps, which is longer. Not optimal.

Hmm. Maybe there's a smarter way. Let's think.

Wait, the constraint requires that either p2 is in l1_4 or p1 is in l2_1 at some state. Let's check which is easier to satisfy.

If we handle p2 first, and during its transportation, p2 passes through l1_4. But l1_4 is in c1. Let's see:

p2 starts in l1_2. To get to l1_1 (airport), the path is l1_2 to l1_1. So maybe driving through other locations? Wait, the drivetruck action can directly move between any two locations in the same city. So from l1_2 to l1_1, can drive directly. So the truck t1 drives from l1_2 to l1_1. So p2 is in l1_1 after that. So during that move, does p2 pass through l1_4? No, because the drive is directly from l1_2 to l1_1. So the truck is in l1_2, then in l1_1. So p2 is never in l1_4. So that doesn't satisfy the constraint.

Alternatively, if we have to make p2 be in l1_4 at some point. To do that, after loading p2 into t1, drive t1 to l1_4, unload there, then reload? But that's adding steps. Let's see:

Alternative steps for p2:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
2. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1 (this would place p2 in l1_4 when unloaded)
3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (now p2 is in l1_4, satisfying the constraint)
4. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (so reload into truck)
5. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
6. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
7. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
8. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
9. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
10. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
11. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
12. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
13. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

This way, step 3 unloads p2 in l1_4, satisfying the constraint. Then proceed as before. But this adds steps (steps 2-4) compared to the previous approach. So total steps would be longer, but satisfies the constraint.

But the problem requires the plan to be optimal (shortest possible). So perhaps this approach is not optimal.

Alternatively, satisfy the constraint by having p1 in l2_1. How?

p1 starts in l2_2. To get to l2_1, which is the airport in c2. So we can load p1 into t2, drive to l2_1, unload. Then proceed.

So steps for p1 to be in l2_1:

1. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
2. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
3. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (now p1 is in l2_1, satisfying the constraint)
4. Then load p1 into airplane a2 (which is already at l2_1)
5. fly a2 to another airport, but perhaps not needed. Wait, the goal is to have p1 in l2_5. So after step 3, p1 is in l2_1. Then need to move it to l2_5. So load into t2 again:

4. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
5. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
6. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

That's 6 steps for p1, which satisfies the constraint at step3.

But then, for p2:

We need to move p2 from l1_2 to l2_4.

But let's see:

For p2:

7. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
8. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
9. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
10. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
11. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
12. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
13. Now, p2 is in l2_1. Then, load into t2 (which is in l2_5 after step6? Wait, after step5, t2 is in l2_5. So no, because after step5, t2 is in l2_5. So to load p2 into t2, need to drive t2 back to l2_1.

So steps:

13. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 (drive from l2_5 to l2_1; possible via intermediate steps?)

Wait, the truck can drive directly between any two locations in the same city. So from l2_5 to l2_1, even if they are not adjacent. So step13: drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2.

Then:

14. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
15. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
16. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

So total steps would be 16. But this is longer than necessary. However, this approach satisfies the constraint when p1 is in l2_1 (step3). So this might be a valid plan.

But comparing the two options: making p2 go through l1_4 (adding steps for p2) vs making p1 go through l2_1 (adding steps for p1). Let's see which is shorter.

Option 1 (p2 in l1_4):

Steps for p2: 13 steps (including constraint satisfaction)
Steps for p1: 3 steps (using t2 before moving it for p2)
But need to check if t2 is available.

Wait, in the first scenario where p1 is handled first, after p1 is delivered to l2_5 (steps 1-3), t2 is in l2_5. Then for p2, steps 4-16 (13 steps) as above. Total steps 16.

Option 2 (p1 in l2_1):

Steps for p1: 6 steps (steps 1-6)
Steps for p2: 10 steps (steps7-16)
Total 16 steps.

Same length. But maybe there's a shorter way.

Wait, perhaps combine steps. Let's think:

After step3 (p1 is in l2_1), we can load p1 into a2 (which is at l2_1). Then fly a2 to another airport, but l2_5 is not an airport. So that doesn't help. So we need to use the truck.

Alternatively, after step3, load p1 into t2 and drive to l2_5. But t2 is in l2_1 after step3. So steps:

4. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
5. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
6. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

That's 3 steps for p1 after step3. So total steps for p1: 3 (steps1-3) + 3 (steps4-6) = 6 steps.

Then for p2:

7. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
8. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
9. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
10. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
11. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
12. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
13. Now, t2 is in l2_5. Need to get p2 from l2_1 to l2_4. So use t2:

13. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2 (direct drive)
14. unloadtruck p2 ... Wait, no. p2 is in l2_1. So steps:

13. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 (drive back to l2_1)
14. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
15. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
16. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

So total steps: 16. Not optimal.

Hmm. So both approaches result in 16 steps. Is there a way to make it shorter?

Alternatively, perhaps use the airplane for p2 and the truck for p1, but find a way to overlap steps.

Wait, let's try to find a plan that satisfies the constraint with minimal steps.

The constraint is that at some state, p2 is in l1_4 or p1 is in l2_1. Let's see which is easier.

If we can have p1 in l2_1 during its transportation, that's better. Let's try that.

Here's a possible plan:

1. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (p1 is loaded into t2 at l2_2)
2. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 (drive to airport, now p1 is in l2_1, satisfying the constraint)
3. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (p1 is in l2_1)
4. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (reload)
5. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
6. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (p1 delivered)

For p2:

7. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
8. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
9. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
10. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
11. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
12. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
13. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (t2 is back at l2_1 after delivering p1?)
Wait, after step5, t2 is in l2_5. So after step6, it's still there. So to load p2 into t2, we need to drive it back to l2_1:

13. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
14. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
15. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
16. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

So total steps: 16. Same as before.

But in this plan, the constraint is satisfied at step3 (p1 in l2_1).

But this plan is 16 steps. Maybe there's a shorter way.

Wait, perhaps instead of unloading p1 in l2_1 (step3), we can keep it in the truck. Wait, the condition is that p1 is in l2_1. If the truck is in l2_1 and p1 is in the truck, does that count? Because the condition is "Package p1 is in location l2_1". But when p1 is in the truck, it's not in the location. So unloading is necessary.

So step3 must be unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 to make p1 in l2_1.

Alternatively, perhaps load p1 into airplane a2 at l2_1. But that's unnecessary unless flying. But since the goal is l2_5, which is not an airport, that's not helpful.

Another approach: Maybe use the airplane a2 to carry p1 to another city and back. But that's adding steps. Not helpful.

Alternative idea: Use the airplane a2 to carry p2 from c1 to c2. Wait, a2 is initially in l2_1 (c2's airport). So it can't be used to carry p2 from c1. Only a1 is in c1.

Wait, a1 is in l1_1 (c1's airport). So to carry p2 from c1 to c2, use a1.

Another thought: What if we satisfy the constraint by having p2 in l1_4. Let's see.

For p2's journey:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
2. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1 (unload here)
3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (satisfies constraint)
4. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
5. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
6. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
7. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
8. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
9. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
10. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
11. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
12. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
13. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

For p1:

14. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (but t2 is in l2_4 after step13)
But wait, p1 is in l2_2. So after step13, t2 is in l2_4. To get p1, t2 needs to drive back to l2_2.

14. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2
15. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
16. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
17. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

That's 17 steps, which is longer. Not optimal.

So the minimal steps seem to be around 16. But perhaps there's a smarter way.

Wait, let's think again about the initial plan for p2 and p1 without considering the constraint. Then check if the constraint is satisfied during the process.

Original plan without constraint consideration:

For p2:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
2. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
4. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
6. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
7. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
8. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
9. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
10. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

For p1:

11. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (but after step10, t2 is in l2_4. So need to drive to l2_2 to pick up p1. Wait, no, p1 is in l2_2. So steps for p1:

11. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2
12. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
13. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
14. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

Total steps: 14. But does this plan satisfy the constraint?

The constraint requires that at some state, either p2 is in l1_4 or p1 is in l2_1. In this plan, p2 is in l2_1 (steps6-8). Let's see:

After step6, p2 is unloaded from a1 into l2_1. So between steps6 and8 (when it's loaded into t2), p2 is in l2_1. But the constraint requires p1 to be in l2_1. So that's not met. So this plan doesn't satisfy the constraint.

Thus, we need to adjust the plan to include a state where either p2 is in l1_4 or p1 is in l2_1.

Ah, I see. In the original plan I thought of (without considering the constraint), p2 passes through l2_1 (when it's unloaded from the airplane), but that's not p1. So the constraint isn't met. So we need to make sure that either p2 is in l1_4 or p1 is in l2_1 at some point.

So the minimal plan that satisfies the constraint must include one of those.

So let's revisit the approach where p1 is taken to l2_1 first.

Alternative plan:

For p1:

1. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
2. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
3. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (satisfies constraint)
4. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
5. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
6. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

For p2:

7. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
8. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
9. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
10. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
11. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
12. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
13. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 (drive t2 back to l2_1)
14. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
15. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
16. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

Total steps: 16. But this satisfies the constraint at step3.

Is there a shorter way? Let's think.

What if during p1's transportation, we make a stop in l2_1. But that's not needed. Alternatively, combine steps.

Wait, after step3, p1 is in l2_1. Then we need to load it back into t2 and drive to l2_5. That's steps4-6.

For p2, after step12, p2 is in l2_1. To move to l2_4, use t2 which is in l2_5. So steps13-16.

But maybe after step6, t2 is in l2_5. So step13 is driving back to l2_1 (step13). That's one step.

Then steps14-16.

So yes, 16 steps.

But is there a way to avoid driving t2 back to l2_1 by using another truck? But there's only t2 in c2.

Alternative idea: Use the airplane a2 (which is in l2_1) to carry p2 from l2_1 to l2_4's airport. But l2_4 isn't an airport. So no.

Hmm. I think this might be the minimal plan given the constraints. 

Now, let's check the constraints again. The constraint requires that at least one of the conditions is true in at least one state. In this plan, step3 satisfies the condition where p1 is in l2_1. So the constraint is satisfied.

Thus, the plan would be:

1. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
2. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
3. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
4. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
5. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
6. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
7. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
8. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
9. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
10. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
11. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
12. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
13. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
14. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
15. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
16. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

This plan has 16 steps. But is there a shorter way?

Wait, after step3, p1 is in l2_1. Then we load it into t2 again (step4). Could we instead fly p1 to another airport and then use a truck? But l2_5 is not an airport. So no.

Alternative idea: After step3 (p1 is in l2_1), can we use airplane a2 to fly p1 to l2_5's airport, but l2_5 isn't an airport. So that's not possible.

Another thought: Maybe combine the use of the airplane for p2 with the truck for p1. But I don't see a way to shorten the steps.

Alternatively, during p2's transport, after flying to l2_1 (step11), p2 is unloaded (step12) into l2_1. At this point, if we use t2 (which is in l2_5 after step6), we have to drive t2 back to l2_1 (step13). But that adds steps.

Is there a way to use t2 for both p1 and p2 without driving back and forth?

For example:

After delivering p1 to l2_5 (step6), t2 is in l2_5. Then, for p2, drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (step13), load p2 (step14), drive to l2_4 (step15), unload (step16). 

Yes, but that's unavoidable.

So I think this is the minimal plan given the constraints.

Let me count the steps again:

1. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
2. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
3. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (constraint met)
4. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
5. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
6. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
7. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
8. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
9. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
10. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
11. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
12. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
13. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
14. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
15. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
16. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

This is 16 steps. Is there a way to reduce this?

Wait, perhaps after step12 (p2 in l2_1), instead of driving t2 back from l2_5 to l2_1, can we use another truck? But there's only t2 in c2. So no.

Alternatively, during the process of moving p1, can we also handle p2's transportation?

For example, after step3, p1 is in l2_1. Then, load p2 into t2 when it's in l2_1. But p2 is in l2_1 only after step12. So steps need to be ordered.

Hmm. I don't see a way to shorten this. So this 16-step plan is the minimal.

But wait, let's check for any redundancies. For example, steps13 and 14: after step6, t2 is in l2_5. Then step13 drives it back to l2_1, step14 loads p2, then step15 drives to l2_4. Is there a way to combine steps? Like, after step13, drive directly to l2_4? No, because p2 needs to be loaded first.

Alternatively, after step12, p2 is in l2_1. If t2 is already in l2_1, then steps13-15 can be avoided. But how to get t2 to l2_1 before step12.

Wait, let's see:

If we handle p2's transportation before moving t2 for p1.

But p2 is in l1_2, and p1 is in l2_2.

Alternative plan:

For p2:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
2. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
4. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
6. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (now p2 is in l2_1)
7. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (t2 is in l2_2 initially. So need to drive t2 to l2_1 first)
8. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 (step7)
9. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (step8)
10. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
11. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

For p1:

12. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (but t2 is in l2_4 after step11)
13. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2
14. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

But during this process, when is the constraint met? When p2 is in l2_1 (step6), but the constraint requires p1 to be in l2_1 or p2 in l1_4. So in this plan, the constraint isn't met.

So we need to adjust.

Alternatively, after step6, p2 is in l2_1. If during this time, p1 is also in l2_1, then the constraint is met. But p1 is still in l2_2. So perhaps after moving p2 to l2_1, we move p1 to l2_1.

So steps:

After step6 (p2 in l2_1):

7. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
8. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 (now p1 is in l2_1, satisfying the constraint)
9. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
10. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
11. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
12. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

For p2:

13. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (but t2 is in l2_5 after step12)
14. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
15. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
16. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
17. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

This is 17 steps. Not better.

Hmm. It seems challenging to find a shorter plan that satisfies the constraint. Perhaps the initial 16-step plan is the minimal.

But wait, another idea: After step3 (unload p1 in l2_1), instead of reloading and driving to l2_5, can we use the airplane a2 to fly p1 to another city and back? For example:

4. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
5. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (c1's airport)
6. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
7. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
8. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
9. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
10. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
11. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
12. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

This is adding steps, making it longer. So no.

Alternatively, after step3, keep p1 in l2_1 and use another truck. But there's only t2 in c2. So no.

I think the minimal plan is 16 steps. But wait, maybe there's a way to have fewer steps by interleaving actions.

For example, while t2 is being used for p1, can we start moving p2's truck?

Let me try to interleave steps.

1. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
2. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
3. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (constraint met)
4. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
5. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
6. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

During this time, start moving p2:

7. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (can be done in parallel with steps1-6)
8. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
9. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
10. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
11. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
12. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

Now, after step6, t2 is in l2_5. Then:

13. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
14. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
15. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
16. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

This is still 16 steps, but maybe some steps can be done in parallel. But the problem requires a sequential plan. So the total steps remain 16.

I think this is the optimal plan under the given constraints.
