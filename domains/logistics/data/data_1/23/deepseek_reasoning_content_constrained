Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. The goal is to get p1 to l2_4 and p2 to l1_5, with some constraints. First, let me understand the initial state and the constraints.

Initial State:
- Locations in c1: l1_1 (airport), l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5.
- Locations in c2: l2_1 (airport), l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5.
- Trucks: t1 is in l1_5 (c1), t2 in l2_5 (c2).
- Airplanes: a1 in l1_1 (c1's airport), a2 in l2_1 (c2's airport).
- Packages: p1 in l1_4 (c1), p2 in l2_4 (c2). Wait, the original state says "Package t1 is in location l1_5" but t1 is a truck. Maybe that's a typo. Probably, the initial state should be "Truck t1 is in l1_5", same for t2 in l2_5. Similarly, "Package a1 is in l1_1" but a1 is an airplane. So maybe that's a mistake. Let me check the problem statement again.

Wait, the problem says "The original state of the world is the following:" and lists "Package t1 is in location l1_5", which is probably a mistake because t1 is a truck. Similarly, "Package a1 is in location l1_1" but a1 is an airplane. That must be a typo. So perhaps the correct initial positions are:

- Truck t1 is at l1_5 (c1)
- Truck t2 is at l2_5 (c2)
- Airplane a1 is at l1_1 (c1's airport)
- Airplane a2 is at l2_1 (c2's airport)
- Package p1 is at l1_4 (c1)
- Package p2 is at l2_4 (c2)

So that's the corrected initial state.

Goal:
- p1 must be at l2_4 (which is in c2)
- p2 must be at l1_5 (which is in c1)

Constraints:
1. At least one state must have p1 in l1_4. But initially, p1 is already in l1_4. So the initial state satisfies this constraint. However, the problem says "the following expression must hold in at least one state". Since the initial state already has p1 in l1_4, this constraint is automatically satisfied. But maybe the problem expects that in the plan, there's a state where p1 is in l1_4 again after moving. Wait, the original state already has p1 there. So maybe the constraint is already met, but perhaps the problem requires that during the plan execution, p1 is in l1_4 again. Wait, no. The problem says "the following expression must hold in at least one state". So as long as in any state during the plan (including the initial state), p1 is in l1_4, which it already is. So the first constraint is automatically satisfied. But maybe after moving p1, we have to bring it back? Hmm, maybe not. Let me check the problem again.

Wait, the user wrote: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'Package p1 is in location l1_4'". Since the initial state has p1 in l1_4, this condition is already true. So the constraint is satisfied. But maybe after moving p1, but during the plan, it's allowed as long as at least one state (including the initial) has p1 in l1_4. So no action needed for that constraint. However, the second constraint is a conditional: If in some state s, p1 is in l1_4, then either p2 is in l2_3 or l1_2 in s or some state after s. Since the initial state has p1 in l1_4, then in that state, the consequent must hold or in a subsequent state. But in the initial state, p2 is in l2_4. So the consequent (p2 in l2_3 or l1_2) is not true. Therefore, the plan must ensure that after the initial state, either in the initial state or in some subsequent state, whenever p1 is in l1_4, then p2 is in l2_3 or l1_2 either at that state or later. But since the initial state already has p1 in l1_4, but p2 is not in l2_3 or l1_2, this violates the constraint. Therefore, the initial state itself violates the constraint. Wait, no. The constraint says: If p1 is in l1_4 in some state s, then either in s or in some state after s, p2 must be in l2_3 or l1_2. So the initial state s0 has p1 in l1_4. Therefore, we must ensure that in s0, p2 is in l2_3 or l1_2 (which it's not), or in some state after s0, p2 is in one of those locations. Therefore, the plan must include moving p2 to l2_3 or l1_2 at some point after the initial state. Because otherwise, the conditional constraint is violated. So the problem is that the initial state has p1 in l1_4, and p2 not in the required locations. So the plan must, after the initial state, at some point move p2 to either l2_3 or l1_2. Because otherwise, the constraint is not met.

So the plan must include moving p2 to l2_3 or l1_2. Let's think about how to do that.

But the main goal is to get p1 to l2_4 and p2 to l1_5. Let's plan for that.

For p1 to get from l1_4 (c1) to l2_4 (c2), we need to use an airplane. Since airplanes can fly between airports. So possible steps:

1. Move p1 from l1_4 to the airport in c1 (l1_1) using truck t1. But t1 is at l1_5. So first, drive t1 to l1_4, load p1, drive to l1_1, unload. Then load onto airplane a1, fly to l2_1 (c2's airport), unload, then use truck t2 (which is at l2_5) to drive to l2_1, load p1, drive to l2_4, unload.

Wait, but t2 is in l2_5. So drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_4 (since l2_4 is in c2). Wait, but l2_5 is in c2. So to move from l2_5 to l2_4, is that possible? The drivetruck action allows moving between any locations in the same city. So yes.

Wait, but p1 needs to go to l2_4, which is where p2 starts. So first, for p1:

- Use truck t1 (in l1_5) to drive to l1_4 (same city c1). Then load p1 into t1. Then drive t1 to l1_1 (the airport). Unload p1 at l1_1. Then load p1 onto airplane a1 (which is at l1_1). Fly a1 to l2_1 (c2's airport). Then unload p1 from a1. Then use truck t2 (which is in l2_5) to drive to l2_1, load p1 into t2, drive to l2_4, unload. That's a possible path.

For p2 to get from l2_4 (c2) to l1_5 (c1):

- Need to transport via airplane. So use truck t2 (which is in l2_5) to drive to l2_4, load p2, drive to l2_1 (airport), unload. Load onto airplane a2 (which is at l2_1), fly to l1_1. Unload p2 at l1_1. Then use truck t1 (which is in l1_5) to drive to l1_1, load p2, drive to l1_5, unload.

But wait, we have to manage the order of these actions because the trucks and airplanes are shared. Let's think step by step.

But also, we need to satisfy the constraint that whenever p1 is in l1_4 (which it is initially), then p2 must be in l2_3 or l1_2 either at that state or later. Since the initial state has p1 in l1_4 but p2 in l2_4, which is not in the required locations. So after the initial state, we need to move p2 to l2_3 or l1_2 at some point.

So the plan must include moving p2 to l2_3 or l1_2. Let's see. Let's say we move p2 to l2_3. How?

Since p2 is in l2_4 (c2), and truck t2 is in l2_5. So t2 can drive to l2_4, load p2, then drive to l2_3 and unload. That would satisfy the constraint.

But when? Because the initial state already has p1 in l1_4, so the constraint requires that in the initial state or some state after, p2 is in l2_3 or l1_2. Since in the initial state, it's not, so we must have p2 in one of those locations at some point after.

But we need to move p2 to l1_5 eventually. So perhaps moving p2 from l2_4 to l2_3 first, then to l2_1 (airport), then to l1_1, then to l1_5.

Wait, but moving p2 to l2_3 would satisfy the constraint, but then we have to move it again. Alternatively, maybe moving p2 to l1_2. But l1_2 is in c1, so how would p2 get there? That would require transporting p2 from c2 to c1 via airplane. So perhaps:

First, move p2 from l2_4 to l2_3 via truck t2. Then move it to l2_1 (airport), load onto a2, fly to l1_1, unload, then use truck t1 to take it to l1_2. But that's a detour. But the constraint requires that after p1 is in l1_4 (which it is initially), p2 is in l2_3 or l1_2 at some point. So moving p2 to l2_3 early in the plan would satisfy that.

So steps for p2:

1. Truck t2 drives from l2_5 to l2_4 (c2). Load p2. Drive to l2_3. Unload p2. (This meets the constraint, as now p2 is in l2_3, which happens after the initial state.)

Then, later, move p2 to l2_1 (airport), load into a2, fly to l1_1, unload, then truck t1 drives to l1_1, loads p2, drives to l1_5, unload.

But this adds extra steps. Alternatively, if we move p2 directly from l2_4 to l2_1 via truck t2, but then during the plan, p2 is not in l2_3 or l1_2. So the constraint would require that after moving p2 to l2_1, but how? Because the initial state had p1 in l1_4, and the constraint says that in any state where p1 is in l1_4, the consequent must hold. But after moving p1 from l1_4, that state (where p1 is no longer in l1_4) is okay. So the only state where p1 is in l1_4 is the initial state. Therefore, the constraint is that if in any state s where p1 is in l1_4, then in s or some subsequent state, p2 is in l2_3 or l1_2. Since the initial state is s0, and in s0 p2 is not in those locations, we need to have p2 in one of those locations in some state after s0. So moving p2 to l2_3 would satisfy that.

So perhaps the plan needs to first move p2 to l2_3, then proceed to transport it to l1_5. Let's outline the plan steps.

Plan steps:

For p1:

1. Move truck t1 from l1_5 to l1_4 (c1).
2. Load p1 into t1 at l1_4.
3. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1 (airport in c1).
4. Unload p1 at l1_1.
5. Load p1 into airplane a1 at l1_1.
6. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1 (c2's airport).
7. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1.
8. Move truck t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (if it's not already there; but t2 starts at l2_5, which is in c2. So drive t2 to l2_1).
9. Load p1 into t2 at l2_1.
10. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4.
11. Unload p1 at l2_4.

For p2:

First, move p2 to l2_3 to satisfy the constraint.

12. Move truck t2 from l2_5 to l2_4 (but wait, after step 8, t2 was moved to l2_1. Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the order because t2 is used for both p1 and p2. Let me re-examine the steps.

Wait, in the steps above for p1, after step 7, p1 is in l2_1. Then step 8 is moving t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (assuming t2 starts at l2_5). So step 8 is "drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2". Then step 9 is loading p1 into t2 at l2_1. Then drive to l2_4, unload. So after that, t2 is in l2_4.

But for p2, which starts at l2_4, we need to move it. So after step 11 (unload p1 at l2_4), t2 is at l2_4. But p2 is there initially. Wait, initially, p2 is in l2_4. So after step 11, p1 is at l2_4, but p2 is still there. Wait, but the goal is to have p2 in l1_5. So we need to handle p2.

But perhaps after moving p1 to l2_4, we need to move p2. However, the steps for p1 and p2 may need to be interleaved. Let me try to outline a possible plan.

But perhaps a better approach is to handle p2 first, to satisfy the constraint. Let's see.

First steps (for p2):

1. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_4 (c2). [To get p2]
2. Load p2 into t2 at l2_4.
3. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_3 (c2).
4. Unload p2 at l2_3. [Now p2 is in l2_3, satisfying the constraint]
5. Then, drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1 (airport).
6. Load p2 into a2 at l2_1.
7. Fly a2 to l1_1 (c1's airport).
8. Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1.
9. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_1 (c1).
10. Load p2 into t1.
11. Drive t1 to l1_5.
12. Unload p2 at l1_5.

Then for p1:

13. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_4.
14. Load p1 into t1.
15. Drive t1 to l1_1.
16. Unload p1 at l1_1.
17. Load p1 into a1.
18. Fly a1 to l2_1.
19. Unload p1 at l2_1.
20. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4.
21. Load p1 into t2.
22. Drive t2 to l2_4.
23. Unload p1 at l2_4.

Wait, but this seems lengthy. Also, t2 is used for both p1 and p2, which may require moving back and forth. Let me check if this plan works.

But wait, after step 4 (p2 is in l2_3), the constraint is satisfied. Then steps 5-12 handle moving p2 to l1_5. Then steps 13-23 handle moving p1 to l2_4. But let's see if there are dependencies or possible overlaps.

Alternatively, maybe the steps can be interleaved. For example, after moving p2 to l2_3, then move p1. Let's see.

But let's check the order. The constraint requires that when p1 is in l1_4 (which is initially), then p2 must be in l2_3 or l1_2 at that state or later. Since the initial state has p1 in l1_4 and p2 in l2_4 (not in required locations), so we need to have p2 in l2_3 or l1_2 at some point after the initial state. Moving p2 to l2_3 in step 4 satisfies that. Then, even if p1 is moved from l1_4 later, the constraint is satisfied because the required condition (p2 in l2_3) happens after the initial state.

So the plan must include moving p2 to l2_3 (or l1_2) at some point. Let's proceed with that.

Now, for the plan steps:

First, handle moving p2 to l2_3.

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2 (truck t2 moves from l2_5 to l2_4)
2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (load p2 into t2 at l2_4)
3. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2 (drive to l2_3)
4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (now p2 is in l2_3, satisfying the constraint)

Then, proceed to move p2 to l1_5:

5. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2 (drive t2 to airport l2_1)
6. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (load p2 into airplane a2)
7. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (fly to c1's airport)
8. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (unload p2 at l1_1)
9. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1 (truck t1 goes to airport)
10. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (load p2 into t1)
11. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1 (drive back to l1_5)
12. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 (now p2 is at goal)

Now, for p1:

13. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1 (t1 goes to l1_4 where p1 is)
14. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4 (load p1)
15. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 (drive to airport)
16. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (unload)
17. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (load into a1)
18. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (fly to c2's airport)
19. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 (unload)
20. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2 (drive t2 to l2_4)
21. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (load p1)
22. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (unload at goal)

Wait, step 20: after step 5, t2 was at l2_1. Then in step 5, we moved t2 to l2_1. Then in step 20, we need to drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4. Then load and unload. But wait, after step 5, t2 is at l2_1, then after step 6, t2 remains there. So steps 5-8: t2 is at l2_1. Then step 9-12 involve t1. Then step 20 is moving t2 from l2_1 to l2_4. Then steps 20-22.

But after step 19, p1 is at l2_1. So we need to get it to l2_4. So steps:

19. unload p1 from a1 at l2_1.
20. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2.
21. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4.
22. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4.

But wait, step 21: after driving to l2_4, t2 is there. Then load p1 (which is at l2_1?), no. Wait, p1 is at l2_1 after step 19. So we need to have t2 at l2_1 to load p1. But step 20 moves t2 to l2_4, so that's a problem. So this approach won't work.

Ah, here's a mistake. After step 19, p1 is at l2_1. To move it to l2_4, we need a truck in l2_1. But t2 was driven to l2_1 in step 5, then steps 6-8 involve unloading p2 into a2. Then, after that, t2 is still at l2_1. So after step 8, t2 is at l2_1. So after step 19, p1 is at l2_1. So steps:

19. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1.
20. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (t2 is at l2_1).
21. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2.
22. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4.

Yes, that's better. So corrected steps for p1:

After step 18 (fly a1 to l2_1):

19. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1.
20. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1.
21. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2.
22. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4.

But wait, t2 was used earlier. Let's check the timeline:

Steps 1-4: moving p2 to l2_3.

Steps 5-8: moving p2 from l2_3 to l1_1.

Steps 9-12: moving p2 to l1_5.

Steps 13-18: moving p1 to l1_1 and flying to l2_1.

Steps 19-22: moving p1 to l2_4.

But after step 8, t2 is at l2_1 (step 5: drivetruck t2 from l2_3 to l2_1, step 6: loadairplane p2 into a2, step 7: fly a2 to l1_1, step 8: unload p2 at l1_1. Then steps 9-12 involve t1 moving to l1_1 and back. Then steps 13-18 involve t1 moving again to l1_4 and back to l1_1, then a1 flies to l2_1. Then, at step 19, p1 is at l2_1. t2 is still at l2_1 (from step 5). So steps 20-22: load p1 into t2, drive to l2_4, unload.

This seems feasible. Now let's count the steps.

The full plan would be:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2
2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
3. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2
4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
5. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
6. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
7. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
8. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
9. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
10. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
11. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
12. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
13. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1
14. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
15. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
16. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
17. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
18. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
19. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
20. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
21. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
22. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

Now check if this plan meets the goal and constraints.

Goals:
- p1 is at l2_4 (step 22)
- p2 is at l1_5 (step 12)

Constraints:
1. At least one state has p1 in l1_4. The initial state has p1 in l1_4, so this is satisfied.
2. If any state has p1 in l1_4, then in that state or a subsequent state, p2 is in l2_3 or l1_2. The only state where p1 is in l1_4 is the initial state. Since in the initial state, p2 is not in l2_3 or l1_2, but after step 4, p2 is in l2_3, which occurs after the initial state. Therefore, the constraint is satisfied because after the initial state, p2 is moved to l2_3.

Yes, this seems to work. Now check for possible optimizations. For example, can we shorten the plan?

Looking at the steps for p2:

Steps 1-4 move p2 to l2_3. Then steps 5-8 move p2 to l1_1. But maybe after step 4, we could immediately start moving p1. But no, because the constraint requires that after the initial state (which has p1 in l1_4), p2 must reach l2_3 or l1_2. So moving p2 to l2_3 early is necessary.

Another optimization: after step 5, t2 is at l2_1. Then in step 20, t2 is used again. So steps are okay.

Wait, after step 5 (drivetruck t2 to l2_1), then step 6 loads p2 into a2. Then a2 flies to l1_1. Then steps 9-12 involve t1 moving p2 to l1_5.

But in steps 13-18, t1 is used again to move p1. So after step 12, t1 is at l1_5 again. Then step 13 moves t1 to l1_4, loads p1, and so on.

But is there a way to combine the use of t1 for both p2 and p1? For example, after moving p2 to l1_5, t1 is back at l1_5. Then, moving p1 from l1_4 to l1_1 via t1.

Yes, that's what the current plan does. So steps 9-12: t1 moves from l1_5 to l1_1, loads p2, drives back to l1_5. Then steps 13-15: t1 goes to l1_4, loads p1, drives to l1_1.

Alternatively, maybe after step 12, t1 is at l1_5, and p2 is there. Then steps 13-16 involve moving p1. So that's okay.

Another possible optimization: when moving p1, after loading into a1 and flying to l2_1, could we have t2 already at l2_1 (from step 5) and immediately load p1 into t2 and drive to l2_4? Yes, that's what steps 19-22 do. So no issues there.

Now, is this the shortest possible plan? Let's see.

Alternative approach: After moving p2 to l2_3 (steps 1-4), then proceed to move p1. But perhaps there's a way to interleave steps.

Wait, after step 4, p2 is in l2_3. Then, we could start moving p1 while also moving p2. For example, while p2 is being transported to l1_5, we can handle p1's transport.

But the current plan is sequential. Maybe it's possible to parallelize, but since actions are sequential, the plan must list them in order.

Another optimization: Could we combine steps where the same truck is used for multiple tasks without extra driving?

For example, after step 12 (p2 is at l1_5), t1 is at l1_5. Then step 13: drive to l1_4. But l1_5 and l1_4 are in the same city. So that's necessary.

Alternatively, could we have t1 first handle p1 before p2? But p2 needs to be moved to l2_3 early to satisfy the constraint. So the constraint requires that p2 is moved to l2_3 or l1_2 after the initial state. So moving p2 first is necessary.

Therefore, the current plan seems optimal. Let's count the steps: 22 steps. But maybe there's a shorter way.

Alternative idea: After moving p2 to l2_3 (step 4), instead of moving p2 all the way to l1_5, perhaps use a different route. For example, after step 4, p2 is in l2_3. Then, can we move p2 to l2_1 and then to l1_1, but perhaps combining steps.

But the current steps for p2 are:

5. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
6. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
7. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
8. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
9. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
10. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
11. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
12. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

These are necessary steps. For p2 to get from l2_3 to l1_5, you need to load into a truck, drive to airport, load into airplane, fly, unload, then load into another truck and drive to destination.

No way around that. So steps 5-12 are necessary.

Similarly, for p1:

Steps 13-22:

13. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1
14. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
15. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
16. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
17. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
18. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
19. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
20. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
21. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
22. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

Again, these steps seem necessary. So 22 steps. But maybe there's a way to reduce steps by reusing trucks or airplanes more efficiently.

Wait, after step 5, t2 is at l2_1. Then in step 20, t2 is still at l2_1 (since steps 6-8 don't involve moving t2). So step 20 is possible. Then steps 20-22 are correct.

But perhaps after step 12, when t1 is back at l1_5, steps 13-16 involve t1 moving to l1_4 and back to l1_1. Could we avoid some of these steps?

For example, after step 12, t1 is at l1_5. To pick up p1 from l1_4, it needs to drive there. So step 13 is necessary. Then step 14: load p1. Step 15: drive to l1_1. Step 16: unload. Then steps 17-22. These are all necessary.

Alternative idea: Could we use a different truck for p1? But the only truck in c1 is t1. So no.

Another optimization: After step 16, p1 is at l1_1. Then steps 17-22 are loading into airplane, flying, unloading, loading into t2, driving to l2_4. No way to shorten that.

So the plan seems to be optimal with 22 steps. But I might have missed a shortcut.

Wait, perhaps after step 4 (p2 is in l2_3), can we move p1 first and then p2? Let's see.

But the constraint requires that after the initial state, p2 must be in l2_3 or l1_2. So moving p2 to l2_3 early is required.

Alternatively, perhaps the plan can be optimized by using airplanes for both packages more efficiently.

Another approach: Use airplane a2 to transport p1, but that might not help.

Alternatively, perhaps after moving p2 to l2_3, use airplane a2 to fly to c1's airport, but that would require a2 to be at l2_1. Yes.

But in the initial state, a2 is at l2_1. So steps for p2:

1. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_4 (c2).
2. Load p2 into t2.
3. Drive to l2_3, unload (constraint satisfied).
4. Drive t2 to l2_1.
5. Load p2 into a2.
6. Fly a2 to l1_1.
7. Unload p2.
8. Use t1 to take p2 to l1_5.

For p1:

9. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_4.
10. Load p1.
11. Drive to l1_1.
12. Unload.
13. Load into a1.
14. Fly a1 to l2_1.
15. Unload.
16. Use t2 (now at l2_1) to take p1 to l2_4.

But this is the same as the previous plan, just reordered. So steps would be similar.

But let's count:

Steps 1-8: same as before (8 steps for p2)
Steps 9-16: 8 steps for p1
Total: 16 steps? Wait, no. Let's recount:

For p2:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2
2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
3. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2
4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
5. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
6. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
7. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
8. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
9. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
10. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
11. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
12. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

For p1:

13. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1
14. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
15. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
16. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
17. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
18. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
19. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
20. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
21. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
22. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

So still 22 steps. I think this is the minimal number of steps required given the constraints. Therefore, the plan is optimal.
