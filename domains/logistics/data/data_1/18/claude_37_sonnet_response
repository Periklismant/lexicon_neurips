Let's analyze the problem:

1. Initial State:
   - Locations l1_1 to l1_5 are in city c1.
   - Locations l2_1 to l2_5 are in city c2.
   - Packages p1 and p2 are in location l1_3.
   - Trucks t1 and t2 are in locations l1_5 and l2_5 respectively.
   - Airplanes a1 and a2 are in locations l1_1 and l2_1 respectively.
   - Locations l1_1 and l2_1 are airports.

2. Goal:
   - Package p1 is in location l1_3.
   - Package p2 is in location l1_3.

3. Constraints:
   - At some point in the plan, either Package p2 must be in airplane a1 OR Package p2 must be in location l2_5.

Let's check if the initial state already satisfies the goal:
- Package p1 is in location l1_3. This is already satisfied.
- Package p2 is in location l1_3. This is already satisfied.

So, the goal is actually already satisfied in the initial state. But there's a constraint that at some point, package p2 must either be in airplane a1 or in location l2_5. So, we need to construct a plan that ensures this constraint is met and then brings p2 back to l1_3 to satisfy the goal.

Let's construct a plan:

1. First, let's move package p2 from l1_3 to either be in airplane a1 or be in location l2_5, to satisfy the constraint.
   - To get p2 in airplane a1, we need to:
     - Move truck t1 from l1_5 to l1_3.
     - Load p2 into t1.
     - Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1 (the airport).
     - Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1.
     - Load p2 into a1 at l1_1.
     
   - To get p2 in location l2_5, we need to:
     - Move truck t1 from l1_5 to l1_3.
     - Load p2 into t1.
     - Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1 (the airport).
     - Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1.
     - Load p2 into a1 at l1_1.
     - Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1 (the airport in city c2).
     - Unload p2 from a1 at l2_1.
     - Move truck t2 from l2_5 to l2_1.
     - Load p2 into t2 at l2_1.
     - Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_5.
     - Unload p2 from t2 at l2_5.

2. After satisfying the constraint, we need to bring p2 back to l1_3 to satisfy the goal.
   - If p2 is in a1 at l1_1, we need to:
     - Unload p2 from a1 at l1_1.
     - Move truck t1 from wherever it is to l1_1.
     - Load p2 into t1 at l1_1.
     - Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_3.
     - Unload p2 from t1 at l1_3.
     
   - If p2 is in location l2_5, we need to:
     - Move truck t2 from wherever it is to l2_5.
     - Load p2 into t2 at l2_5.
     - Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (the airport).
     - Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1.
     - Load p2 into a2 at l2_1.
     - Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
     - Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1.
     - Move truck t1 from wherever it is to l1_1.
     - Load p2 into t1 at l1_1.
     - Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_3.
     - Unload p2 from t1 at l1_3.

Let's choose the first approach for constraint satisfaction (getting p2 into a1), as it seems to be the shortest path to satisfy the constraint. After that, we'll bring p2 back to l1_3.

Actually, there seems to be a typo in the initial state description. It says:
"Package t1 is in location l1_5"
"Package t2 is in location l2_5"
"Package a1 is in location l1_1"
"Package a2 is in location l2_1"

But t1 and t2 are trucks, and a1 and a2 are airplanes, not packages. Let's assume the intended meanings are:
"Truck t1 is in location l1_5"
"Truck t2 is in location l2_5"
"Airplane a1 is in location l1_1"
"Airplane a2 is in location l2_1"

Let's continue with this understanding.

Actually, I just re-read the problem, and I see that the goals is:
"Package p1 is in location l1_3" and "Package p2 is in location l1_3"

And these are already satisfied in the initial state. But there's a constraint that at some point, package p2 must either be in airplane a1 or in location l2_5. So, we need to move p2 either to airplane a1 or to location l2_5, and then bring it back to l1_3 to satisfy the goal.

Given the constraint, let's choose to satisfy it by moving p2 to location l2_5, since it seems to be the more challenging path and would ensure that the constraint is met. Then, we'll bring p2 back to l1_3.

Here's the overall plan:

1. Move truck t1 from l1_5 to l1_3.
2. Load p2 into t1 at l1_3.
3. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1 (the airport).
4. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1.
5. Load p2 into a1 at l1_1.
6. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1 (the airport in city c2).
7. Unload p2 from a1 at l2_1.
8. Move truck t2 from l2_5 to l2_1.
9. Load p2 into t2 at l2_1.
10. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_5.
11. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_5. (This satisfies the constraint that at some point, p2 is in location l2_5.)
12. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1.
13. Load p2 into t2 at l2_5.
14. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1.
15. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1.
16. Load p2 into a1 at l2_1. (Assuming a1 is still at l2_1 from step 6.)
17. Fly a1 from l2_1 to l1_1.
18. Unload p2 from a1 at l1_1.
19. Load p2 into t1 at l1_1. (Assuming t1 is still at l1_1 from step 3.)
20. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_3.
21. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_3.

Actually, it took me a bit to reconcile with the actions given in the problem. I think we can simplify this a bit.

One option is to put p2 into a1, which would satisfy the constraint:

1. Move truck t1 from l1_5 to l1_3 (drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1).
2. Load p2 into t1 at l1_3 (loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3).
3. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1 (the airport) (drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1).
4. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1 (unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1).
5. Load p2 into a1 at l1_1 (loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1).  
   (This satisfies the constraint that at some point, p2 is in a1.)
6. Unload p2 from a1 at l1_1 (unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1).
7. Load p2 into t1 at l1_1 (loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1).
8. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_3 (drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1).
9. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_3 (unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3).

This plan satisfies the constraint (by putting p2 in a1) and achieves the goal (by bringing p2 back to l1_3).

But wait, I just realized that there's another typo in the action descriptions. It says:
"loadairplane p ap l": Unload package p from airplane ap in location l.

This should probably be:
"unloadairplane p ap l": Unload package p from airplane ap in location l.

Let's continue with this understanding.

Let's also think about if it's easier to just move p2 to l2_5 to satisfy the constraint.

1. Move truck t1 from l1_5 to l1_3 (drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1).
2. Load p2 into t1 at l1_3 (loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3).
3. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1 (the airport) (drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1).
4. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1 (unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1).
5. Load p2 into a1 at l1_1 (loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1).
6. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1 (flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1).
7. Unload p2 from a1 at l2_1 (unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1).
8. Move truck t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2).
9. Load p2 into t2 at l2_1 (loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1).
10. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_5 (drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2).
11. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_5 (unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5).  
    (This satisfies the constraint that at some point, p2 is in location l2_5.)
12. Load p2 into t2 at l2_5 (loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5).
13. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2).
14. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1 (unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1).
15. Load p2 into a1 at l2_1 (loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1).
16. Fly a1 from l2_1 to l1_1 (flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1).
17. Unload p2 from a1 at l1_1 (unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1).
18. Load p2 into t1 at l1_1 (loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1).
19. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_3 (drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1).
20. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_3 (unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3).

This plan is longer than the first one, so I'll stick with the first plan, where we satisfy the constraint by putting p2 in a1.

Oops, I just noticed another typo in the action descriptions. There are two "loadairplane" actions, and no "unloadairplane" action. But from the context, I can understand that one should be "unloadairplane". I've been using this understanding in my plans.

Let me state the correct first plan again, satisfying the constraint by putting p2 in a1:

1. Move truck t1 from l1_5 to l1_3 (drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1).
2. Load p2 into t1 at l1_3 (loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3).
3. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1 (the airport) (drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1).
4. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1 (unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1).
5. Load p2 into a1 at l1_1 (loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1).  
   (This satisfies the constraint that at some point, p2 is in a1.)
6. Unload p2 from a1 at l1_1 (unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1).
7. Load p2 into t1 at l1_1 (loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1).
8. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_3 (drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1).
9. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_3 (unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3).

This plan satisfies the constraint (by putting p2 in a1) and achieves the goal (by bringing p2 back to l1_3).

Actually, I just realized that we're making this problem much harder than it needs to be. The goal states that both p1 and p2 should be in location l1_3, and they are already there in the initial state. The only additional requirement is that at some point during the plan, p2 should either be in a1 or in location l2_5. This doesn't mean we have to end with p2 in l1_3; it just means that at some point in our plan, p2 should satisfy the constraint. So, actually, we can have a plan like:

1. Move truck t1 from l1_5 to l1_3 (drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1).
2. Load p2 into t1 at l1_3 (loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3).
3. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1 (the airport) (drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1).
4. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1 (unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1).
5. Load p2 into a1 at l1_1 (loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1).  
   (This satisfies the constraint that at some point, p2 is in a1.)
6. Unload p2 from a1 at l1_1 (unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1).
7. Load p2 into t1 at l1_1 (loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1).
8. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_3 (drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1).
9. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_3 (unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3).

But wait... no, this makes no sense. The final state (after the last action of the plan) needs to satisfy the goal. If the goal is that both p1 and p2 are in location l1_3, and they are already there in the initial state, then why do we need to move p2 at all?

Let me re-read the problem statement:

"The task is to bring about the following situation:
	"The following conditions are all true: "Package p1 is in location l1_3", "Package p2 is in location l1_3"""

"A valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints:
	"The following expression must hold in at least one state: 
		"At least one of the following conditions is true: "Package p2 is in a1", "Package p2 is in location l2_5"""

So, the goal is to have both p1 and p2 in location l1_3, and they are already there in the initial state. But there's a constraint that at some point in the plan, p2 must either be in a1 or in location l2_5. So, we need to move p2 from l1_3, satisfy the constraint, and then bring it back to l1_3.

Here's the plan again:

1. Move truck t1 from l1_5 to l1_3 (drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1).
2. Load p2 into t1 at l1_3 (loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3).
3. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1 (the airport) (drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1).
4. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1 (unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1).
5. Load p2 into a1 at l1_1 (loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1).  
   (This satisfies the constraint that at some point, p2 is in a1.)
6. Unload p2 from a1 at l1_1 (unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1).
7. Load p2 into t1 at l1_1 (loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1).
8. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_3 (drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1).
9. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_3 (unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3).

Hang on. What if I think through the instruction asking for an "optimal plan"? This means I should provide the shortest valid plan. If we have to satisfy the constraint that at some point, p2 is either in a1 or in location l2_5, and then the goal is to have both p1 and p2 in location l1_3, then the above plan seems optimal.

Actually, there's something strange about the initial state. It says p1 and p2, which are packages, are in location l1_3. Then it says "Package t1 is in location l1_5" and "Package t2 is in location l2_5". But t1 and t2 are trucks, not packages. Similarly, it says "Package a1 is in location l1_1" and "Package a2 is in location l2_1". But a1 and a2 are airplanes, not packages. Maybe there's some confusion here?

Let's assume trucks t1 and t2 are at locations l1_5 and l2_5 respectively, and airplanes a1 and a2 are at locations l1_1 and l2_1 respectively. Then t1 is a truck in city c1, t2 is a truck in city c2, a1 is an airplane at the airport of city c1, and a2 is an airplane at the airport of city c2.

Now, let's re-analyze the problem. Initially, packages p1 and p2 are at location l1_3 in city c1. Our goal is to have both p1 and p2 at location l1_3 in city c1, which is already satisfied in the initial state. However, there's a constraint that at some point in our plan, p2 must either be in airplane a1 or at location l2_5 in city c2.

So, we need to move p2 from l1_3, satisfy the constraint, and then bring it back to l1_3. The shortest plan would be to:

1. Move truck t1 from l1_5 to l1_3 (drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1).
2. Load p2 into t1 at l1_3 (loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3).
3. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1 (the airport) (drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1).
4. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1 (unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1).
5. Load p2 into a1 at l1_1 (loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1).  
   (This satisfies the constraint that at some point, p2 is in a1.)
6. Unload p2 from a1 at l1_1 (unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1).
7. Load p2 into t1 at l1_1 (loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1).
8. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_3 (drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1).
9. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_3 (unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3).

But this assumes that the constraint is satisfied if p2 is in a1, not necessarily at location l2_5. If the constraint specifically requires p2 to be at location l2_5, then we would need a longer plan:

1. Move truck t1 from l1_5 to l1_3 (drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1).
2. Load p2 into t1 at l1_3 (loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3).
3. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1 (the airport) (drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1).
4. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1 (unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1).
5. Load p2 into a1 at l1_1 (loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1).
6. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1 (flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1).
7. Unload p2 from a1 at l2_1 (unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1).
8. Move truck t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2).
9. Load p2 into t2 at l2_1 (loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1).
10. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_5 (drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2).
11. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_5 (unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5).  
    (This satisfies the constraint that at some point, p2 is in location l2_5.)
12. Load p2 into t2 at l2_5 (loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5).
13. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2).
14. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1 (unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1).
15. Load p2 into a1 at l2_1 (loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1).  
    (This assumes a1 is still at l2_1 from step 6).
16. Fly a1 from l2_1 to l1_1 (flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1).
17. Unload p2 from a1 at l1_1 (unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1).
18. Load p2 into t1 at l1_1 (loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1).  
    (This assumes t1 is still at l1_1 from step 3).
19. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_3 (drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1).
20. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_3 (unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3).

If the constraint says "At least one of the following conditions is true: 'Package p2 is in a1', 'Package p2 is in location l2_5'", then we can satisfy it by ensuring that at some point in our plan, p2 is in a1. This would make the first plan optimal, as it's shorter.

Actually, let's look at the constraint again:

"The following expression must hold in at least one state: 
    "At least one of the following conditions is true: "Package p2 is in a1", "Package p2 is in location l2_5"""

This means either p2 should be in a1 OR p2 should be in location l2_5 at some point in the plan. The first plan satisfies this by having p2 in a1 at one point, and it's shorter than the second plan, so it's the optimal plan.

The first plan is:

1. Move truck t1 from l1_5 to l1_3 (drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1).
2. Load p2 into t1 at l1_3 (loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3).
3. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1 (the airport) (drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1).
4. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1 (unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1).
5. Load p2 into a1 at l1_1 (loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1).  
   (This satisfies the constraint that at some point, p2 is in a1.)
6. Unload p2 from a1 at l1_1 (unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1).
7. Load p2 into t1 at l1_1 (loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1).
8. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_3 (drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1).
9. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_3 (unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3).

This is the optimal plan as it satisfies the goal (both p1 and p2 should be at location l1_3) and the constraint (p2 should at some point be in a1 or at location l2_5), in the shortest way possible.

Wait, I just realized I've been making another mistake in the interpretation. Let's double-check the action descriptions that were given:

"loadtruck p t l": Load package p in truck t. Both p and t are in location l.
"loadairplane p ap l": Load package p in airplane ap. Both p and ap are in location l.
"unloadtruck p t l": Unload package p from truck t in location l.
"loadairplane p ap l": Unload package p from airplane ap in location l.
"drivetruck t l_from l_to c": Drive truck t from location l_from to location l_to in city c.
"flyairplane ap l_from l_to": Fly airplane ap from location l_from to location l_to.

There are two "loadairplane" actions. Given the context, one of them is supposed to be "unloadairplane", most likely:
"unloadairplane p ap l": Unload package p from airplane ap in location l.

With this correction, the plan remains the same. I just want to make sure I'm interpreting the actions correctly.

In summary, the optimal plan is to:

1. Move truck t1 from l1_5 to l1_3.
2. Load p2 into t1 at l1_3.
3. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1.
4. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1.
5. Load p2 into a1 at l1_1. (This satisfies the constraint.)
6. Unload p2 from a1 at l1_1.
7. Load p2 into t1 at l1_1.
8. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_3.
9. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_3.

Oh wait, I get confused about the initial state again. Let's start from the beginning:

The original state of the world is the following:
"Location l1_1 is in city c1"
"Location l1_2 is in city c1"
"Location l1_3 is in city c1"
"Location l1_4 is in city c1"
"Location l1_5 is in city c1"
"Location l2_1 is in city c2"
"Location l2_2 is in city c2"
"Location l2_3 is in city c2"
"Location l2_4 is in city c2"
"Location l2_5 is in city c2"
"Package t1 is in location l1_5"
"Package t2 is in location l2_5"
"Package p1 is in location l1_3"
"Package p2 is in location l1_3"
"Package a1 is in location l1_1"
"Package a2 is in location l2_1"

It says "Package t1 is in location l1_5", but t1 is a truck, not a package. Similarly for t2, a1, a2. I think there's just a typo where they wrote "Package" instead of the correct types. So, the corrected initial state is:

"Location l1_1 is in city c1"
"Location l1_2 is in city c1"
"Location l1_3 is in city c1"
"Location l1_4 is in city c1"
"Location l1_5 is in city c1"
"Location l2_1 is in city c2"
"Location l2_2 is in city c2"
"Location l2_3 is in city c2"
"Location l2_4 is in city c2"
"Location l2_5 is in city c2"
"Truck t1 is in location l1_5"
"Truck t2 is in location l2_5"
"Package p1 is in location l1_3"
"Package p2 is in location l1_3"
"Airplane a1 is in location l1_1"
"Airplane a2 is in location l2_1"

With this understanding, and the knowledge that locations l1_1 and l2_1 are airports, the plan I've derived is correct.

Actually, I just realized that I made a mistake in the action descriptions. Let me double-check:

"loadtruck p t l": Load package p in truck t. Both p and t are in location l.
"loadairplane p ap l": Load package p in airplane ap. Both p and ap are in location l.
"unloadtruck p t l": Unload package p from truck t in location l.
"loadairplane p ap l": Unload package p from airplane ap in location l.

The last one should be "unloadairplane p ap l". Assuming this, the plan remains the same.

Given the optimal plan, with the correct action names, is:

1. Drive truck t1 from l1_5 to l1_3 (drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1).
2. Load package p2 into truck t1 at l1_3 (loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3).
3. Drive truck t1 from l1_3 to l1_1 (drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1).
4. Unload package p2 from truck t1 at l1_1 (unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1).
5. Load package p2 into airplane a1 at l1_1 (loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1).  
   (This satisfies the constraint that at some point, p2 is in a1.)
6. Unload package p2 from airplane a1 at l1_1 (unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1).
7. Load package p2 into truck t1 at l1_1 (loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1).
8. Drive truck t1 from l1_1 to l1_3 (drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1).
9. Unload package p2 from truck t1 at l1_3 (unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3).

I'm confident in this plan given my understanding of the problem.
