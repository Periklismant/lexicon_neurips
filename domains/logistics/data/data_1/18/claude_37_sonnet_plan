1. Drive truck t1 from l1_5 to l1_3 (drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1).
2. Load package p2 into truck t1 at l1_3 (loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3).
3. Drive truck t1 from l1_3 to l1_1 (drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1).
4. Unload package p2 from truck t1 at l1_1 (unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1).
5. Load package p2 into airplane a1 at l1_1 (loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1).  
   (This satisfies the constraint that at some point, p2 is in a1.)
