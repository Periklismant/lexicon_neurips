Let me analyze the problem:

We have two cities, c1 and c2, each with 5 locations. The locations l1_1 and l2_1 are airports.

We need to move package p1 to location l2_5 and package p2 to location l1_3.

Additionally, there are constraints:
1. Package p2 must be in location l1_3 at some point (this is already part of our goal).
2. If p2 is in location l1_3, it must have been in location l1_2 earlier.

First, let's understand where everything is initially:
- Package p1 is in location l2_2 (in city c2)
- Package p2 is in location l1_4 (in city c1)
- Truck t1 is in location l1_4 (in city c1)
- Truck t2 is in location l2_5 (in city c2)
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (in city c1, airport)
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1 (in city c2, airport)

For package p1, we need to move it from l2_2 to l2_5, both in city c2. We can use truck t2, but it's already at the destination. So we need to drive t2 to l2_2, load p1, drive to l2_5, and unload p1.

For package p2, we need to move it from l1_4 to l1_3, both in city c1. But due to the constraint, p2 must first visit l1_2. So the path would be l1_4 -> l1_2 -> l1_3. We can use truck t1, which is already at the starting location.

Let's formulate a plan:

For package p1:
1. Drive truck t2 from l2_5 to l2_2 in city c2.
2. Load package p1 in truck t2 at location l2_2.
3. Drive truck t2 from l2_2 to l2_5 in city c2.
4. Unload package p1 from truck t2 at location l2_5.

For package p2:
1. Load package p2 in truck t1 at location l1_4.
2. Drive truck t1 from l1_4 to l1_2 in city c1.
3. Unload package p2 from truck t1 at location l1_2.
4. Load package p2 in truck t1 at location l1_2.
5. Drive truck t1 from l1_2 to l1_3 in city c1.
6. Unload package p2 from truck t1 at location l1_3.

Actually, I realize I don't need to unload and then immediately reload p2 at l1_2, since it's already in the truck. I just need to stop by l1_2 to satisfy the constraint.

Revised plan:

For package p1:
1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

For package p2:
1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1
3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
4. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
5. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1
6. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

Wait a second, I see some errors in my initial understanding:

The initial state of the world:
- "Package t1 is in location l1_4"
- "Package t2 is in location l2_5"
- "Package p1 is in location l2_2"
- "Package p2 is in location l1_4"
- "Package a1 is in location l1_1"
- "Package a2 is in location l2_1"

This is inconsistent. If t1, t2, a1, and a2 are trucks and airplanes, not packages. Let me re-read the problem.

I think there's a confusion in the problem statement. It refers to "Package t1", "Package t2", "Package a1", and "Package a2", but t1, t2, a1, and a2 are trucks and airplanes, not packages.

Let me assume the intended initial state:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_4 (in city c1)
- Truck t2 is in location l2_5 (in city c2)
- Package p1 is in location l2_2 (in city c2)
- Package p2 is in location l1_4 (in city c1)
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (in city c1, airport)
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1 (in city c2, airport)

Based on this, let me revise the plan:

For package p1:
1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

For package p2:
1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1
3. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1
4. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

Wait, I see the constraint more clearly now: "If p2 is in location l1_3, it must have been in location l1_2 earlier." I was mistakenly thinking that p2 needed to be unloaded at l1_2, but it only needs to pass through l1_2. So my last plan for p2 is correct.

But let me check the original constraint once more:

"If expression 'Package p2 is in location l1_3' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'Package p2 is in location l1_2'."

This means that if p2 is in l1_3, then at some earlier state p2 must have been in l1_2. It doesn't just mean that the truck t1 carrying p2 should pass through l1_2. It means p2 itself should be at l1_2.

So, for p2, I think we do need to unload and reload at l1_2.

Revised plan for package p2:
1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1
3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
4. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
5. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1
6. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

Let me verify that this plan satisfies all constraints:
- Package p1 ends up in location l2_5.
- Package p2 ends up in location l1_3.
- Package p2 is in location l1_3 at some point.
- Before p2 is in location l1_3, it's in location l1_2.

Yes, the plan satisfies all constraints. Let's combine both parts:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
5. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
6. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1
7. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
8. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
9. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1
10. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

Let me review the steps one by one to ensure correctness:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2: Drive truck t2 from l2_5 to l2_2 in city c2.
   Preconditions: Truck t2 is in l2_5, and both l2_5 and l2_2 are locations of c2. This holds.
   Effects: Truck t2 is now in l2_2 and not in l2_5.

2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2: Load package p1 in truck t2 at location l2_2.
   Preconditions: Package p1 and truck t2 are both in location l2_2. This holds.
   Effects: Package p1 is now in truck t2 and not in location l2_2.

3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2: Drive truck t2 from l2_2 to l2_5 in city c2.
   Preconditions: Truck t2 is in l2_2, and both l2_2 and l2_5 are locations of c2. This holds.
   Effects: Truck t2 is now in l2_5 and not in l2_2.

4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5: Unload package p1 from truck t2 at location l2_5.
   Preconditions: Truck t2 is in l2_5, and package p1 is in truck t2. This holds.
   Effects: Package p1 is now in location l2_5 and not in truck t2.

5. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4: Load package p2 in truck t1 at location l1_4.
   Preconditions: Package p2 and truck t1 are both in location l1_4. This holds.
   Effects: Package p2 is now in truck t1 and not in location l1_4.

6. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1: Drive truck t1 from l1_4 to l1_2 in city c1.
   Preconditions: Truck t1 is in l1_4, and both l1_4 and l1_2 are locations of c1. This holds.
   Effects: Truck t1 is now in l1_2 and not in l1_4.

7. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2: Unload package p2 from truck t1 at location l1_2.
   Preconditions: Truck t1 is in l1_2, and package p2 is in truck t1. This holds.
   Effects: Package p2 is now in location l1_2 and not in truck t1.

8. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2: Load package p2 in truck t1 at location l1_2.
   Preconditions: Package p2 and truck t1 are both in location l1_2. This holds.
   Effects: Package p2 is now in truck t1 and not in location l1_2.

9. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1: Drive truck t1 from l1_2 to l1_3 in city c1.
   Preconditions: Truck t1 is in l1_2, and both l1_2 and l1_3 are locations of c1. This holds.
   Effects: Truck t1 is now in l1_3 and not in l1_2.

10. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3: Unload package p2 from truck t1 at location l1_3.
    Preconditions: Truck t1 is in l1_3, and package p2 is in truck t1. This holds.
    Effects: Package p2 is now in location l1_3 and not in truck t1.

The plan satisfies all the preconditions of the actions and achieves the desired goal state.

But let me check once more if the plan is optimal:

For package p1, we need to move it from l2_2 to l2_5, both in city c2. We use truck t2, which is already at the destination. So we drive t2 to l2_2, load p1, drive to l2_5, and unload p1. It seems optimal.

For package p2, we need to move it from l1_4 to l1_3, both in city c1. Due to the constraint, p2 must first visit l1_2. We use truck t1, which is already at the starting location. We load p2, drive to l1_2, unload, load again, drive to l1_3, and unload. It seems optimal.

So the plan is optimal, and it satisfies all constraints.

Final Plan:
1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
5. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
6. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1
7. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
8. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
9. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1
10. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

But actually, I think there's a shorter solution, by working with parallel plans:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
2. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
3. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1
4. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
5. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
6. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
7. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
8. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1
9. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
10. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

But this is still 10 steps. Let's see if there's another optimization:

I think the fundamental requirement is that we have 10 steps:
- 4 steps for package p1 (drive to pickup, load, drive to dropoff, unload)
- 6 steps for package p2 (load, drive to l1_2, unload, load, drive to l1_3, unload)

So I think 10 steps is the minimum.

Let me check once more if there's any other way to satisfy the constraint for p2:

"If expression 'Package p2 is in location l1_3' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'Package p2 is in location l1_2'."

This means that if p2 is in l1_3, then at some earlier state p2 must have been in l1_2. The constraint does not specify that p2 should immediately move from l1_2 to l1_3; it just says that p2 should have been in l1_2 at some point before it's in l1_3. 

But given the domain actions, there's no way for p2 to be in l1_2 and then get to l1_3 without being loaded and unloaded. So the steps of unloading at l1_2 and then loading again are necessary. That's why the plan needs 10 steps.

Final Plan (revised for clarity):
1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
5. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
6. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1
7. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
8. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
9. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1
10. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

This plan is optimal and satisfies all constraints.

Actually, I realized I misunderstood: the constraint doesn't tell us to pass through l1_2; it tells us that p2 must be at l1_2 at some point before it's at l1_3. It doesn't say that we need to immediately proceed from l1_2 to l1_3.

So here's a different interpretation:

We have to move p2 from l1_4 to l1_3, and at some point before it reaches l1_3, it must be at l1_2. 

But this doesn't change the actions; we still need to drive to l1_2, unload, load, and then drive to l1_3. So the plan remains the same.

Let me review the plan one more time:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
5. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
6. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1
7. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
8. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
9. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1
10. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

This plan is optimal and satisfies all constraints. p1 ends up in l2_5, and p2 ends up in l1_3, after having been in l1_2.

Wait, I realized there's a typo in the problem statement. It says:

```
	"unloadairplane p ap l": Unload package p from airplane ap in location l.
```

But the second occurrence of "loadairplane" should be "unloadairplane". The actions are correctly explained, just the name is incorrect in the listing.

So, the final plan:
```
drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
```
