Okay, let's see. I need to create a plan to move packages p1 and p2 to their respective destinations while satisfying the constraints. The initial state has p1 in l2_3 (which is in city c2) and p2 in l1_5 (city c1). The goal is p1 in l1_4 and p2 in l1_2. 

First, the constraints. There's a requirement that in at least one state, p1 is in l1_1. And if that's true, then before that, p2 must be either in l1_1 or l2_3. But initially, p2 is in l1_5, so to satisfy that, maybe I need to move p2 to l1_1 first, but wait, how?

Wait, the constraint says that if p1 is in l1_1 at any state, then there must be an earlier state where p2 is in l1_1 or l2_3. Since p2 starts in l1_5, which is in city c1. So if we need to have p1 in l1_1 (the airport of c1), then before that, p2 must be in l1_1 or l2_3. But initially, p2 is in l1_5. So perhaps we need to move p2 to l1_1 first, which would satisfy that condition, then move p1 to l1_1. Let's think.

So the plan must involve p1 being in l1_1 at some point. Let's outline the steps.

First, handle p1. It's in l2_3, which is in city c2. To get it to l1_4 in c1. Since airplanes can fly between airports, maybe we can use an airplane. Let's check the airports: l2_1 is in c2, and l1_1 in c1. So to move p1 from l2_3 to c1, perhaps we need to use a truck in c2 to move it to the airport l2_1, load it onto an airplane, fly to l1_1, then use a truck in c1 to move it to l1_4.

Wait, but the initial positions of the trucks and airplanes: t1 is in l1_4, t2 is in l2_1. Airplanes a1 is in l1_1, a2 is in l2_1. So a2 is already at l2_1 (the airport of c2). So maybe use a2 to transport p1.

So steps for p1:

1. Move p1 from l2_3 (c2) to l2_1 (airport) using truck t2. But initially, t2 is in l2_1, right? Wait, the original state says "Package t1 is in location l1_4", "Package t2 is in location l2_1". Wait, wait, the original state might have a typo. Wait, looking back: the original state says:

"Package t1 is in location l1_4"

"Package t2 is in location l2_1"

Wait, but t1 and t2 are trucks. Wait, maybe that's a mistake. Because the objects are:

"truck t1"

"truck t2"

So the initial state should have the trucks in locations. So the line "Package t1 is in location l1_4" is probably a mistake. Maybe it's a typo, and should be "Truck t1 is in location l1_4". Similarly for t2. Otherwise, if they are packages, that's conflicting with the problem statement. But the problem mentions that "trucks may carry packages", so t1 and t2 are trucks. So the original state's lines about t1 and t2 must be typos. Let me check again.

The original state says:

"Package t1 is in location l1_4"

"Package t2 is in location l2_1"

But that can't be right. Because t1 and t2 are trucks, not packages. The packages are p1 and p2. So this must be a typo. It's more likely that the intended initial state is:

"Truck t1 is in location l1_4"

"Truck t2 is in location l2_1"

Similarly, the lines for a1 and a2: "Package a1 is in location l1_1" and "Package a2 is in location l2_1" — but a1 and a2 are airplanes, so those lines should be "Airplane a1 is in location l1_1", etc. So I think the problem statement has a typo here, but we have to proceed with what's given.

But according to the problem statement, the original state is:

Original state:

"Package t1 is in location l1_4"

"Package t2 is in location l2_1"

"Package p1 is in location l2_3"

"Package p2 is in location l1_5"

"Package a1 is in location l1_1"

"Package a2 is in location l2_1"

Wait, but the objects include "truck t1", "truck t2", "airplane a1", "airplane a2". So the original state lists them as Packages, which must be a mistake. This is a problem. Because in the domain, trucks and airplanes are not packages. So perhaps this is a misstatement. But since we can't change the problem, we have to proceed under the assumption that the initial state is as given, even if it's inconsistent.

Alternatively, maybe it's a formatting error where "Package" was used instead of "Truck" or "Airplane". Let's assume that's the case. Otherwise, the problem is impossible. For example, if t1 is a package in l1_4, but the trucks are t1 and t2 (as per the objects), then they are in their respective locations. But the problem statement's original state says that t1 is a package, which conflicts. So to make sense of this, perhaps the user intended to write "Truck t1 is in location l1_4", "Truck t2 is in location l2_1", "Airplane a1 is in location l1_1", "Airplane a2 is in location l2_1". That would make sense.

Given that, we can proceed with that corrected initial state. So the actual initial positions are:

Trucks:

- t1 is at l1_4 (city c1)

- t2 is at l2_1 (city c2)

Airplanes:

- a1 is at l1_1 (city c1's airport)

- a2 is at l2_1 (city c2's airport)

Packages:

- p1 is at l2_3 (city c2)

- p2 is at l1_5 (city c1)

Now, the goal is p1 at l1_4 (city c1) and p2 at l1_2 (city c1).

Constraints:

1. At some state, p1 is in l1_1.

2. If p1 is in l1_1 at any state, then in an earlier state, p2 is in l1_1 or l2_3.

So, the plan must include p1 being in l1_1 at some point. Then, before that, p2 must be in l1_1 or l2_3. Since initially, p2 is in l1_5, which is in c1. So to meet this constraint, perhaps we need to move p2 to l1_1 first, then move p1 to l1_1, but that's an extra step.

Alternatively, maybe during the transportation of p1, we have to pass through l1_1 (the airport of c1). Let's see.

So for p1 to get from l2_3 (c2) to l1_4 (c1), the steps would be:

- Use truck t2 in c2 to pick up p1 from l2_3. But t2 is at l2_1 (the airport). So drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_3 (same city c2), load p1 into t2, then drive back to l2_1, then load p1 into airplane a2 (since a2 is at l2_1), fly a2 to l1_1 (c1's airport), unload p1 into l1_1. Then use truck t1 (which is at l1_4) to drive to l1_1, but wait, l1_4 is in c1. Wait, t1 is initially at l1_4. So to move t1 to l1_1, we need to drive it through the city's locations. So drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1 (if possible). But cities have locations connected. The cities c1 has locations l1_1, l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5. So can a truck move between any of these? The drivetruck action requires that l_from and l_to are in the same city. So, t1 can drive from l1_4 to l1_1 via intermediate locations if necessary, but maybe the cities have a connected graph. Assuming that the truck can drive directly between any two locations in the same city. So drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1. Then load p1 from l1_1 into t1, then drive to l1_4 and unload. Wait, but p1 is in l1_1 (unloaded from airplane), then loaded into t1, then driven to l1_4 and unloaded.

But this would require the steps:

For p1:

1. In c2: t2 is at l2_1. So first drive t2 to l2_3 (drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2).

2. Load p1 into t2 (loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3).

3. Drive t2 back to l2_1 (drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2).

4. Load p1 into airplane a2 (loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1).

5. Fly a2 to l1_1 (flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1).

6. Unload p1 from a2 (unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1). Now p1 is in l1_1.

But here, at this point, the constraint requires that in some state p1 is in l1_1, which is satisfied here. Now, before this, we need to ensure that p2 was in l1_1 or l2_3 in an earlier state. But p2 starts in l1_5. So perhaps we need to move p2 to l1_1 first.

Wait, the constraint says that if p1 is in l1_1 in any state, then there must be an earlier state where p2 is in l1_1 or l2_3. So in this case, after step 6, p1 is in l1_1, so before that step, p2 must have been in l1_1 or l2_3. But p2 starts in l1_5, so unless we move p2 to l1_1 before step 6, that condition isn't met. So perhaps we need to first move p2 to l1_1, which would satisfy that condition.

So let's plan for p2 first. The goal for p2 is l1_2. It's initially in l1_5 (c1). To get to l1_2, we can use truck t1 (which is in l1_4). So steps for p2:

- Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_5 (drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1).

- Load p2 into t1 (loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5).

- Drive t1 to l1_1 (since we need to get p2 to l1_1 for the constraint). But wait, why drive to l1_1? Because then p2 is in l1_1, which would satisfy the condition for the constraint when p1 arrives there later. So:

But the goal is to get p2 to l1_2, so maybe after getting it to l1_1, we can drive to l1_2. But that's extra steps. Let's see.

Alternatively, maybe move p2 to l1_1 first, then to l1_2. Let's outline:

1. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_5 (c1).

2. Load p2 into t1 at l1_5.

3. Drive t1 to l1_1 (maybe through intermediate locations? But maybe directly).

4. Unload p2 at l1_1. Now p2 is in l1_1. This satisfies the condition that in an earlier state than when p1 is in l1_1, p2 was in l1_1. Then, proceed to move p1 to l1_1 as per earlier steps.

But then, after that, we need to move p2 from l1_1 to l1_2. So:

5. Load p2 into t1 again at l1_1 (since t1 is there now).

6. Drive t1 to l1_2 and unload. That would achieve p2's goal.

But this adds steps. Let's check if this can be optimized.

Alternatively, perhaps instead of moving p2 to l1_1 first, we can have p2 pass through l2_3? But l2_3 is in c2. That seems unlikely. Because p2 is in c1. So perhaps the only way to satisfy the constraint is to move p2 to l1_1 before p1 is moved there.

So combining both packages' plans:

First, handle p2:

1. Drive t1 (located at l1_4) to l1_5 (c1) to pick up p2.

   Action: drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1

2. Load p2 into t1 at l1_5.

   Action: loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

3. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_1. Are l1_5 and l1_1 in the same city (c1)? Yes. So possible.

   Action: drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1

4. Unload p2 at l1_1.

   Action: unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

Now p2 is in l1_1. Then proceed to handle p1's transportation:

5. In c2, drive t2 (located at l2_1) to l2_3.

   Action: drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2

6. Load p1 into t2 at l2_3.

   Action: loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

7. Drive t2 back to l2_1.

   Action: drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

8. Load p1 into a2 (which is at l2_1).

   Action: loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

9. Fly a2 to l1_1.

   Action: flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

10. Unload p1 from a2 into l1_1.

   Action: unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

Now, p1 is in l1_1 (satisfying the constraint), and since before this (step 4), p2 was in l1_1, the constraint is met.

Now, proceed to move p1 to l1_4 (its goal):

11. Load p1 into t1 (which is at l1_1) — but t1 is already at l1_1 after step 3. Wait, step 3: t1 drove to l1_1, then step 4 unloaded p2 there. So t1 is at l1_1. So:

11. Load p1 into t1 at l1_1.

   Action: loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

12. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_4 (c1).

   Action: drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

13. Unload p1 at l1_4.

   Action: unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

Now, p1 is at l1_4 (goal). For p2, which is in l1_1 (from step 4), we need to get it to l1_2.

14. Load p2 into t1 at l1_1 (t1 is at l1_4 now? Wait, no. After step 12, t1 is driven to l1_4, so after step 13, t1 is at l1_4. So to move p2 from l1_1 to l1_2, perhaps use t1 again. Wait, after step 13, t1 is at l1_4. So to move p2 from l1_1 to l1_2, t1 needs to go back to l1_1. Let's see:

Wait, after step 13, t1 is at l1_4. So we need to get p2 from l1_1 to l1_2. But p2 is in l1_1. So maybe drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1 again.

14. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1 (c1).

   Action: drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1

15. Load p2 into t1 at l1_1.

   Action: loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

16. Drive t1 to l1_2.

   Action: drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1

17. Unload p2 at l1_2.

   Action: unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

Now, p2 is at l1_2 (goal). But this seems like a lot of steps. Let's check if this is optimal.

Alternative approach: After step 4 (p2 in l1_1), can we load p2 into t1 and drive to l1_2 before dealing with p1?

But that would require:

After step 4:

5. Load p2 into t1 at l1_1.

   Action: loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

6. Drive t1 to l1_2 and unload.

   Action: drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1

   Action: unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

Then p2 is done. Then proceed with p1's steps. But then, when p1 arrives at l1_1 (from a2), the constraint is that p1 is in l1_1, and in an earlier state (before that), p2 was in l1_1. But in this alternative, p2 was in l1_1 in step 4, which is before p1 arrives there. So that satisfies the constraint. Let's see:

So revised plan:

For p2:

1. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_5 (c1).

   drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1

2. Load p2 into t1.

   loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

3. Drive t1 to l1_1.

   drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1

4. Unload p2 at l1_1.

   unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

5. Load p2 into t1 again.

   loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

6. Drive to l1_2 and unload.

   drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1

   unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

Now p2 is done. Then for p1:

7. In c2, drive t2 to l2_3.

   drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2

8. Load p1 into t2.

   loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

9. Drive back to l2_1.

   drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

10. Load p1 into a2.

    loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

11. Fly a2 to l1_1.

    flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

12. Unload p1 into l1_1.

    unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

Now, the constraint is satisfied because p1 is in l1_1 here (step 12), and in an earlier state (step 4) p2 was in l1_1. So that's good.

Then, to get p1 to l1_4:

13. Load p1 into t1 (assuming t1 is at l1_2). Wait, after step 6, t1 is at l1_2. So to load p1 from l1_1 into t1, we need t1 to be at l1_1. But t1 is at l1_2. So this is a problem.

Ah, right. So after step 6, t1 is at l1_2. So we need to get t1 back to l1_1 to load p1. So:

13. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1.

    drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1

14. Load p1 into t1.

    loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

15. Drive to l1_4.

    drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

16. Unload p1.

    unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

Now this works. But this is more steps. Let's count: 16 steps. The previous approach had 17 steps. But maybe there's a way to optimize.

Alternatively, perhaps after moving p2 to l1_2, use the same truck t1 to handle p1.

Wait, after step 6 (p2 is unloaded at l1_2), t1 is at l1_2. Then, when p1 is unloaded at l1_1 (step 12), t1 needs to get back to l1_1. So drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1 (step 13), then load p1 and drive to l1_4. So steps 13-16.

But perhaps there's a better way. For example, after moving p2 to l1_2, leave t1 there. Then use another truck? But there's only t1 in c1 and t2 in c2. So in c1, the only truck is t1. So we have to use t1 for all movements in c1.

Thus, this seems unavoidable.

But let's check if the steps can be optimized.

Alternative approach for p1:

After p1 is unloaded at l1_1 (step 12), can we use another airplane or truck? No, because in c1, the only truck is t1, which is at l1_2. So t1 needs to drive back to l1_1 to pick up p1.

Alternatively, use airplane a1 (which is at l1_1) to fly somewhere else? But the goal is l1_4 for p1, which is a non-airport location. So must use truck to get from airport to l1_4.

So steps 13-16 are necessary.

Thus, total steps would be 16. But can we make this shorter?

Wait, maybe when t1 is driving p2 to l1_1 (steps 3 and 4), after unloading p2 at l1_1, instead of immediately loading it back to take to l1_2, maybe we first handle the p1 steps up to when p1 is in l1_1, then use t1 to move both packages.

Let me think:

For p2:

1. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_5: drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1

2. Load p2: loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

3. Drive to l1_1: drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1

4. Unload p2: unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (now p2 is in l1_1)

For p1:

5. Drive t2 to l2_3: drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2

6. Load p1: loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

7. Drive back to l2_1: drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

8. Load into a2: loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

9. Fly to l1_1: flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

10. Unload p1: unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (now p1 is in l1_1)

Now, constraint is satisfied: p1 is in l1_1 at step 10, and p2 was in l1_1 at step 4, which is earlier.

Now, load both p1 and p2 into t1:

But p1 is in l1_1, and p2 is in l1_1. t1 is at l1_1 (from step 3). So:

11. Load p1 into t1: loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

12. Load p2 into t1: loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (but after step 4, p2 is in l1_1, so possible)

Wait, can we load both packages into t1 at the same time? The domain allows a truck to carry multiple packages as long as they are loaded. But each load action is per package. So steps:

11. Load p1 into t1: loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

12. Load p2 into t1: loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

Then drive t1 to l1_4 (for p1) and then to l1_2 (for p2):

13. Drive t1 to l1_4: drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

14. Unload p1: unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

15. Drive t1 to l1_2: drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1

16. Unload p2: unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

This would be 16 steps, but perhaps combining the loading steps.

But is that possible? Let's see:

After step 10, p1 and p2 are both in l1_1.

t1 is at l1_1.

So steps:

11. Load p1 into t1.

12. Load p2 into t1.

Then drive to l1_4, unload p1, drive to l1_2, unload p2.

That's 6 steps for p1 and p2 after step 10.

This reduces the total steps compared to the previous plan. Let's count:

Steps 1-10: 10 steps.

Then steps 11-16: 6 steps. Total 16.

But wait, original steps in first approach had 16 steps. So same number.

But maybe this approach is better. Let's see.

Alternatively, after step 10, when both packages are in l1_1, can we load them into t1, drive to l1_4, unload p1, then drive to l1_2 and unload p2. That would require:

11. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

12. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

13. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

14. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

15. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1

16. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

Yes, this works. So steps 11-16 are 6 steps, total steps 16.

But this is the same as before. However, perhaps this is more efficient.

So the full plan would be:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1

2. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

3. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1

4. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

5. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2

6. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

7. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

8. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

9. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

10. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

11. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

12. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

13. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

14. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

15. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1

16. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

This plan has 16 actions. Let's verify:

- All preconditions are met.

- The constraints are satisfied: p1 is in l1_1 at step 10. Before that, at step 4, p2 is in l1_1.

- Goals: p1 is at l1_4 (step14), p2 at l1_2 (step16).

But wait, in step 15, t1 drives from l1_4 to l1_2. Are those locations in the same city (c1)? Yes. So that's allowed.

Yes, this seems to work. Now, check if it's optimal. Are there fewer steps possible?

Alternatively, after step 10, when p1 is in l1_1, and p2 is in l1_1, perhaps we can load both into t1 and then unload them in the right order.

But the plan is to take p1 to l1_4 and p2 to l1_2. So the truck must first go to l1_4, then to l1_2, which requires two drives. Alternatively, can we do it in one trip? No, because l1_4 and l1_2 are separate locations. Unless there's a direct route, but the drive action requires moving from one location to another in the same city, so each movement is between two locations. So from l1_1 to l1_4, then to l1_2: that's two drive actions.

So this plan is 16 steps. Is there a shorter plan?

Let me think. For example, after unloading p1 at l1_1 (step10), could we use the same truck to transport both packages in a way that reduces steps?

Another approach: After step 4, p2 is in l1_1. Then, drive t1 to l1_2 and unload p2. Then, when handling p1, use t1 to pick up p1 from l1_1 and take it to l1_4.

But steps:

For p2:

1. drive t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1

2. load p2 t1 l1_5

3. drive t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1

4. unload p2 t1 l1_1

5. load p2 t1 l1_1

6. drive t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1

7. unload p2 t1 l1_2

Then for p1:

8. drive t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2

9. load p1 t2 l2_3

10. drive t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

11. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

12. fly a2 l2_1 l1_1

13. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

14. drive t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 (t1 is at l1_2 after step7)

15. load p1 t1 l1_1

16. drive t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

17. unload p1 t1 l1_4

This is 17 steps, which is longer. So the previous plan of 16 steps is better.

Thus, the optimal plan seems to be 16 steps. But maybe there's a smarter way. Let's think again.

Wait, when p1 is loaded into t1 (step11), then p2 is still in l1_1. Can we load p2 into t1 in the same step? No, each load action is per package. So two separate load actions are needed.

Alternatively, can we drive t1 to l1_2 after dropping p1 at l1_4? That's what step15 and 16 do.

Another thought: Can we use airplane a1 (at l1_1) to help? For example, after p1 is in l1_1, fly a1 somewhere else. But since p1 needs to go to l1_4, which is not an airport, it's not helpful.

Alternatively, after step10, when p1 is in l1_1, can we load it into a1 and fly to another airport, but since the goal is a non-airport location, that's not useful.

So I think the 16-step plan is optimal.

Now, check for typos and correctness:

In step5, driving t2 to l2_3.

In step8, loading p1 into a2.

Yes, a2 is at l2_1.

Then fly to l1_1.

Unload p1 there.

Then load into t1 (which is at l1_1 after step3).

Wait, after step3, t1 is at l1_1. Step4 unloads p2 there. Then steps5-10 are for p1, during which t1 remains at l1_1.

So steps11 and 12 load both packages into t1.

Then drive to l1_4 (step13), unload p1 (step14), drive to l1_2 (step15), unload p2 (step16).

Yes, this works.

Now, verifying all preconditions:

- For drivetruck actions, are the locations in the same city? For example, step1: l1_4 and l1_5 are in c1.

- loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5: t1 is at l1_5 after step1.

Yes.

Similarly, all steps should meet preconditions.

Constraints are met: p1 is in l1_1 (step10), and p2 was in l1_1 (step4) earlier.

So this plan should be valid and optimal.
