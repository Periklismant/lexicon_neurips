Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. First, I need to understand the initial state, the goal, and the constraints. The initial state has packages p1 in l1_5 and p2 in l1_4. The goal is to have p1 in l2_3 and p2 in l1_4. Wait, p2 is already in l1_4 initially, so maybe we just need to make sure it stays there? But maybe the problem allows for it to be moved and then brought back. But the constraints might complicate things.

The constraints are two-fold. First, there must be at least one state where p1 is in l2_1. Second, whenever p1 is in l2_1 in some state, there must have been an earlier state where p2 is in l2_3. So, we need to arrange the plan such that p1 passes through l2_1 (which is an airport in city c2) and that before p1 reaches l2_1, p2 is in l2_3. But l2_3 is in city c2, and currently p2 is in l1_4 (city c1). So how can p2 get to l2_3? Let's see.

First, let's think about moving p1 to l2_3. Since l2_3 is in city c2, which is a different city from where p1 starts (c1). So we probably need to use an airplane. Let's see: p1 is in l1_5 (c1). To get it to another city, we need to first move it to an airport in c1 (l1_1), then load it onto an airplane (a1 is at l1_1), fly to c2's airport (l2_1), then unload. Then from l2_1, maybe use a truck in c2 to drive it to l2_3. But wait, the trucks available are t1 and t2. Wait, looking back at the original state: "Package t1 is in location l1_4" and "Package t2 is in location l2_2". Wait, maybe that's a typo? Because trucks are vehicles, not packages. Let me recheck the original state.

Wait, the original state says: "Package t1 is in location l1_4" — that must be a mistake. Because t1 is a truck. So probably, the correct initial state is that Truck t1 is in location l1_4. Similarly for t2 in l2_2. Similarly, "Package a1 is in location l1_1" — but a1 is an airplane, so maybe that's supposed to be Airplane a1 is in l1_1. Similarly for a2 in l2_1. So I think there's a mistake in the original state description. The user might have mixed up "Package" with "Truck" or "Airplane". Let me recheck the original state statements:

Original state:
- "Package t1 is in location l1_4" — this is probably a mistake. t1 is a truck, so it should be "Truck t1 is in location l1_4".
- Similarly, "Package t2 is in location l2_2" → Truck t2 is in l2_2.
- "Package a1 is in location l1_1" → Airplane a1 is in l1_1.
- "Package a2 is in location l2_1" → Airplane a2 is in l2_1.

Assuming that, then the initial positions are:

Truck t1 is in l1_4 (c1)
Truck t2 is in l2_2 (c2)
Airplane a1 is in l1_1 (c1's airport)
Airplane a2 is in l2_1 (c2's airport)
Packages:
p1 in l1_5 (c1)
p2 in l1_4 (c1)

Goal: p1 in l2_3 (c2), p2 remains in l1_4 (c1) — but since the initial state already has p2 in l1_4, perhaps we need to ensure that p2 is not moved. But maybe during the plan, p2 is moved and then brought back. But the constraints complicate this.

Constraints:
1. At least one state has p1 in l2_1.
2. If p1 is ever in l2_1, then in an earlier state, p2 is in l2_3.

Wait, that's a problem. Because p2 starts in l1_4 (c1), and l2_3 is in c2. To get p2 to l2_3, we need to transport it from c1 to c2. But how? Since trucks can't move between cities, only airplanes. So to move p2 from c1 to c2, we'd need to use an airplane. But that seems complicated because the initial position of p2 is in l1_4 (c1). Let's outline the steps.

First, for p1 to reach l2_3:

1. Move p1 from l1_5 (c1) to l1_1 (c1's airport) via truck. But the trucks in c1 are t1 (in l1_4). So we need to drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_5. Wait, can trucks move between locations in their city? Yes. So t1 is in l1_4 (c1), so we can drive it to l1_5 (c1) using drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1. Then load p1 into t1 at l1_5. Then drive t1 to l1_1 (the airport) in c1. Unload p1 at l1_1. Then load p1 onto airplane a1 (which is at l1_1). Fly a1 to l2_1 (c2's airport). Unload p1 there. Then use truck t2 (which is in l2_2) to drive to l2_1, load p1, drive to l2_3, unload.

But wait, t2 is in l2_2 (c2). So to get to l2_1 (airport in c2), we need to drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1. Then load p1 into t2, drive to l2_3, unload.

But during this process, when p1 is in l2_1 (airport), we satisfy the first constraint. However, the second constraint says that whenever p1 is in l2_1, there must have been an earlier state where p2 is in l2_3. But p2 is initially in l1_4 (c1), so how can p2 get to l2_3 (c2)?

That's the tricky part. Because the constraint requires that before p1 arrives in l2_1, p2 must have been in l2_3 at some earlier state. But p2 starts in c1. To get p2 to l2_3, which is in c2, we need to transport it via airplane. Let's see:

But to do that, we need to get p2 from l1_4 (c1) to an airport in c1 (l1_1). Load onto airplane a1, fly to l2_1. Then unload, then use truck t2 (in l2_2) to drive to l2_1, load p2, drive to l2_3, unload. Then perhaps transport it back? But that complicates things. Wait, but the goal requires p2 to be in l1_4 at the end. So if we move p2 to l2_3 and then back, but that seems time-consuming.

Alternatively, maybe during the transportation of p1, we can arrange for p2 to be moved to l2_3 first, then p1 goes through l2_1, satisfying the constraints. But how?

Let's outline the steps:

1. Move p2 from l1_4 to l1_1 (airport in c1) using truck t1.
   - Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_4 (wait, no. p2 is already in l1_4. So load p2 into t1 at l1_4. Then drive t1 to l1_1. Then unload p2 at l1_1. Load p2 onto airplane a1. Fly a1 to l2_1. Unload p2 at l2_1. Then use truck t2 to move p2 from l2_1 to l2_3. Unload p2 in l2_3. Now, p2 is in l2_3. Then, to satisfy the constraint, when p1 arrives at l2_1, the previous state where p2 is in l2_3 exists. But after that, we need to move p2 back to l1_4. Because the goal is p2 in l1_4. Wait, but the goal is that p2 is in l1_4. So initially, p2 is there, so if we move it and then bring it back, that's okay. But how?

But moving p2 to l2_3 would require:

- Load p2 into t1 at l1_4.
- Drive t1 to l1_1.
- Unload p2 at l1_1.
- Load p2 onto a1.
- Fly a1 to l2_1.
- Unload p2 at l2_1.
- Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1.
- Load p2 into t2.
- Drive t2 to l2_3.
- Unload p2 at l2_3.

Now, p2 is in l2_3. Then, when p1 is loaded into a1 and flown to l2_1, the constraint is satisfied because when p1 is in l2_1, there was an earlier state (when p2 was in l2_3) before that. But then, after that, we need to move p1 from l2_1 to l2_3. But also, we need to move p2 back to l1_4. However, the goal requires p2 to be in l1_4. So after moving p2 to l2_3, we need to move it back. But how? That would require transporting p2 back from c2 to c1, which again requires using an airplane.

So steps would be:

For p2:

1. Load p2 into t1 at l1_4.
2. Drive t1 to l1_1.
3. Unload p2 at l1_1.
4. Load p2 into a1.
5. Fly a1 to l2_1.
6. Unload p2 at l2_1.
7. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1.
8. Load p2 into t2.
9. Drive t2 to l2_3.
10. Unload p2 at l2_3. (Now, p2 is in l2_3, satisfying the condition for the constraint.)

Then, for p1:

11. Load p1 into t1 (assuming t1 is back in l1_5? Wait, t1 was driven to l1_1 earlier. So after step 2, t1 is in l1_1. So to get p1 from l1_5, we need another truck. Wait, the trucks in c1 are t1 and t2? Wait, the initial trucks are t1 in c1 (l1_4) and t2 in c2 (l2_2). So in c1, only t1 is available. So after moving t1 to l1_1 (step 2), to move p1 from l1_5, we need to drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_5. Let me adjust:

Wait, after step 2, t1 is in l1_1. Then after step 3 (unload p2), t1 is still in l1_1. So to get p1 from l1_5, we need to drive t1 to l1_5:

After step 3:

4. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_5. (drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1)
5. Load p1 into t1 (loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5)
6. Drive t1 back to l1_1 (drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1)
7. Unload p1 at l1_1 (unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1)
8. Load p1 into a1 (loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1)
9. Fly a1 to l2_1 (flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1)
10. Unload p1 from a1 (unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1) → Now, p1 is in l2_1. At this point, the constraint is satisfied because in step 10, p2 was in l2_3 (step 10 is after step 10 of p2's steps? Wait, need to sequence correctly.

Wait, let's reorganize the steps:

First, handle moving p2 to l2_3:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (t1 is at l1_4)
2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
4. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
6. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
7. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 (t2 is initially at l2_2)
8. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
9. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
10. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 → Now, p2 is in l2_3.

Now, after this, when p1 is moved to l2_1, the constraint will be met because in step 10, p2 was in l2_3.

Then, proceed to move p1:

But how do we move p1? p1 is initially in l1_5. To get it to l2_3, need to:

11. Move t1 (which is in l1_1 after step 2) to l1_5.

But after step 2, t1 is in l1_1. So step 11 would be:

11. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
12. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
13. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
14. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
15. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 → But a1 is now in l2_1 after step 5. Wait, in step 5, a1 flew to l2_1. So a1 is no longer in l1_1. So we can't load p1 into a1 at l1_1 after step 5. Oh, this is a problem. Because after step 5, a1 is in l2_1. So how do we get p1 into an airplane in c1? Maybe use a different airplane. Wait, the airplanes are a1 and a2. a2 is in l2_1 initially. So perhaps we need to fly a1 back to l1_1 after moving p2.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let's think again.

Alternative approach: After moving p2 to l2_3 (steps 1-10), then we need to bring a1 back to l1_1 to carry p1. So:

After step 5 (fly a1 to l2_1), a1 is there. To use it again to carry p1, we need to fly it back to l1_1.

But then, after step 5 (fly a1 to l2_1), we can't load p2 into a1 anymore. Wait, no, in step 4, p2 is loaded into a1 at l1_1. Then a1 flies to l2_1 (step5). Then p2 is unloaded (step6). Then a1 is still in l2_1. So to use a1 again, we need to fly it back to l1_1.

So after step 10 (p2 is in l2_3), we can:

11. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1 → now a1 is back in c1's airport.

Then proceed with moving p1:

12. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1 → t1 was left in l1_1 after step 2.

13. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5

14. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1

15. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

16. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

17. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

18. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 → now p1 is in l2_1 (satisfies constraint)

Now, to get p1 to l2_3:

19. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2 → wait, t2 is in l2_3 after step9? Let me check:

In step7, t2 is driven from l2_2 to l2_1.

Step8: load p2 into t2 at l2_1.

Step9: drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_3.

Step10: unload p2. So after step10, t2 is in l2_3.

So to move p1 from l2_1 to l2_3, we need to drive t2 back to l2_1.

But after step10, t2 is in l2_3. So step19 would be:

19. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

20. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

21. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2

22. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 → Now p1 is in l2_3.

But during this process, when p1 is in l2_1 (step18), the constraint is satisfied because in step10, p2 was in l2_3. So the constraint holds: when p1 is in l2_1 (state after step18), there was an earlier state (step10) where p2 is in l2_3.

But after step10, we need to move p2 back to l1_4 because the goal requires p2 to be there. How?

Currently, p2 is in l2_3 (step10). To return it to l1_4:

23. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 → t2 is in l2_3 after step21? Wait, no. Let's track t2's movements.

Wait, t2's path:

Initial location: l2_2.

Step7: drive t2 to l2_1.

Step8: load p2 into t2 at l2_1.

Step9: drive to l2_3.

Step10: unload p2. So after step10, t2 is in l2_3.

Then step19: drive t2 back to l2_1 (from l2_3 to l2_1).

Step20: load p1 into t2 at l2_1.

Step21: drive to l2_3.

Step22: unload p1. So after step22, t2 is in l2_3.

So after step22, t2 is in l2_3. To move p2 back, we need to:

23. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 → but p2 is in l2_3 from step10. So load it into t2.

24. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

25. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 → now p2 is in l2_1.

Then, to get p2 back to c1, we need to load it into an airplane and fly to c1.

But airplane a1 is in l2_1 after step17. So:

26. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

27. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1

28. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 → p2 is in l1_1.

Then use t1 to drive to l1_4.

But where is t1 now? After step14, t1 was driven to l1_1 (step14: drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1). After step14, t1 is in l1_1.

So:

29. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

30. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

31. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 → now p2 is back in l1_4, which is the goal.

But this seems like a very long plan, and we need to check if all steps are necessary. Also, the constraints are satisfied once during the plan, but perhaps there's a shorter way.

Wait, maybe there's a smarter way. Let's think again. The constraints require that p1 is in l2_1 at least once, and whenever it is, there was an earlier state where p2 is in l2_3. But maybe we can have p2 be moved to l2_3 first, then p1 passes through l2_1, and then p2 is moved back. However, moving p2 back may not be needed if the goal doesn't require it. Wait, the goal says p2 must be in l1_4. So since p2 starts there, if we move it and then bring it back, that's okay. But the initial state has p2 in l1_4. If during the plan, p2 is moved to l2_3 and then back to l1_4, then the final state meets the goal.

But how can we do that with minimal steps?

Alternative plan:

1. Move p2 from l1_4 to l2_3, then back to l1_4, and during that time, have p1 pass through l2_1 after p2 was in l2_3.

But how?

Alternatively, perhaps we can have p2's movement to l2_3 and back happen before moving p1. Let's see:

First, move p2 to l2_3:

Steps for p2:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
4. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
6. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
7. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
8. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
9. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
10. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 → p2 in l2_3

Then move p2 back:

11. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
12. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
13. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
14. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (a1 is in l2_1 after step5)
15. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
16. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
17. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (t1 is in l1_1 after step2)
18. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
19. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 → p2 back in l1_4

Now, after step10, p2 is in l2_3. Then when moving p1 through l2_1, we need to ensure that p1 is there after step10. So moving p1 after step10.

For p1:

20. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1 → t1 is back in l1_4 after step18? Wait, no. Let's track t1:

After step2, t1 is in l1_1.

After step3, still in l1_1.

After step18, t1 is driven from l1_1 to l1_4 (step18: drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1). So after step19, t1 is in l1_4.

So step20 would be possible:

20. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1
21. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
22. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
23. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
24. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (a1 is back in l1_1 after step15)
25. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
26. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 → now p1 is in l2_1 (satisfies constraint)
27. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2 (t2 is in l2_1 after step13)
28. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
29. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 → Wait, no. After step13, t2 is in l2_1. So step27: drive to l2_3? Or step27: drive from l2_1 to l2_3.

Yes:

27. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
28. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 → p1 is loaded here?
Wait, no. After unloading p2 in step13, t2 is in l2_1. So to move p1 from l2_1 to l2_3:

26. After unloading p1 in l2_1 (step26), p1 is in l2_1.

27. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2 (t2 is in l2_1)
28. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 → but t2 is in l2_3 now. So p1 is in l2_1, and t2 is in l2_3. That's a problem. So need to have t2 in l2_1 to load p1.

Wait, after step13, t2 is in l2_1. After step27 (drive to l2_3), t2 is in l2_3. So after step26, p1 is in l2_1. To load into t2, t2 needs to be in l2_1. So perhaps:

27. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (t2 is in l2_1)
28. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
29. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 → p1 is in l2_3.

So steps:

26. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 → p1 in l2_1.
27. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
28. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
29. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 → goal achieved.

But during this, when p1 is in l2_1 (step26), there was an earlier state (step10) where p2 was in l2_3. And after step29, p1 is in l2_3 and p2 is back in l1_4 (step19). So the goals are met.

But this plan is very long. Let's count the steps:

For p2: steps 1-19 (19 steps)
For p1: steps 20-29 (10 steps)
Total: 29 steps. But this seems too long. There must be a shorter way.

Alternatively, perhaps we can interleave the steps. For example, after moving p2 to l2_3 and then back to l1_4, but before moving p2 back, move p1 through l2_1. Let's see:

But the constraint requires that when p1 is in l2_1, there was an earlier state where p2 is in l2_3. So if we move p1 to l2_1 after p2 has been to l2_3, even if p2 is then moved back, the constraint is satisfied. So perhaps:

1. Move p2 to l2_3.
2. Move p1 to l2_1, triggering the constraint (since p2 was in l2_3 earlier).
3. Move p2 back to l1_4.
4. Move p1 to l2_3.

But how to do this efficiently.

Alternative plan:

First part: Move p2 to l2_3.

Steps:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
4. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
6. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
7. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
8. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
9. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
10. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 → p2 in l2_3.

Now, p2 is in l2_3. Now, move p1 to l2_1, which triggers the constraint. But p1 is in l1_5. So:

11. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1 (t1 is in l1_1 after step2)
12. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
13. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
14. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
15. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (a1 is still in l2_1 after step5. Oh, no. a1 flew to l2_1 in step5. So a1 is in l2_1. So to load p1 into a1, we need to fly a1 back to l1_1.

So after step10, a1 is in l2_1. So we need to:

11. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1 → a1 is back in l1_1.
12. Now proceed to move p1:

12. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1 (t1 is in l1_1 after step3)
13. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
14. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
15. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
16. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
17. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 → p1 in l2_1 (constraint met because p2 was in l2_3 at step10)
18. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

Now, to move p1 to l2_3:

19. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2 → t2 is in l2_3 after step10. So drive it back to l2_1.
20. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
21. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
22. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 → p1 in l2_3.

Now, move p2 back to l1_4:

23. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (t2 is in l2_3 after step21)
24. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
25. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
26. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (a1 is in l2_1 after step17)
27. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
28. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
29. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (t1 is in l1_1 after step14)
30. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
31. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 → p2 back in l1_4.

This plan has 31 steps, which is very long. But maybe there's a shorter way. Let's think again.

What if we use airplane a2 for transporting p2 back? Because a2 is initially in l2_1 (city c2's airport). So after step10, p2 is in l2_3. To move it back, perhaps use a2.

But a2 is in l2_1 initially. So after step6, a2 is still in l2_1. So when we need to move p2 back:

After step10 (p2 in l2_3), we can drive t2 to l2_3, load p2, drive to l2_1, then load into a2 and fly to l1_1.

But a2's airport is l2_1. So:

Steps after step10:

11. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (t2 is in l2_3 after step9)
12. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
13. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
14. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
15. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 → but l1_1 is in c1. Can airplanes fly between any airports? Yes. So a2 can fly to l1_1.
16. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
17. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (t1 is in l1_1 after step3)
18. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
19. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 → p2 back.

But this uses a2, which wasn't used before. This would save steps compared to using a1.

So this part is steps 11-19 (9 steps) to move p2 back.

Meanwhile, for p1:

After step10 (p2 in l2_3), we can start moving p1:

20. fly a1 back to l1_1 (step11: flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1) → but in the previous steps, a1 is in l2_1 after step5.

Wait, in step5, a1 flew to l2_1. Then in step11, if we use a2 for p2's return, then a1 is still in l2_1. So:

To move p1:

20. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1 (t1 is in l1_1 after step3)
21. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
22. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
23. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
24. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (a1 is still in l2_1. So we need to fly a1 back to l1_1 first.)

So:

19. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1 (step19)
24. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (step24)
25. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
26. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 → p1 in l2_1 (constraint met)
27. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2 (t2 is in l2_1 after step13)
28. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (wait, t2 is in l2_3 after driving? Let's track t2:

After step12, t2 is driven from l2_3 to l2_1 (step12: drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2 → but wait, step12 is part of p2's return steps. Let's correct:

In the alternative plan using a2:

After step10 (p2 in l2_3), steps to return p2:

11. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (t2 is in l2_3)
12. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
13. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 → p2 in l2_1
14. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
15. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
16. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 → p2 in l1_1
17. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (t1 is in l1_1)
18. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
19. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 → p2 back in l1_4.

Then, for p1:

20. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1 (a1 is in l2_1 from step5)
21. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1 (t1 is in l1_4 after step19)
22. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
23. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
24. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
25. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
26. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
27. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 → p1 in l2_1 (constraint met)
28. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2 (t2 is in l2_1 after step13)
29. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
30. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2 (wait, t2 is in l2_1. So step28: drive to l2_3. Then step29: load p1 at l2_3? No. Because p1 is in l2_1 after step27. So:

After step27, p1 is in l2_1. t2 is in l2_1 (after step13). So:

28. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
29. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
30. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 → p1 in l2_3.

This gives us a total of 30 steps. Still quite long. But perhaps there's a smarter way.

Wait, what if we use airplane a2 to transport p1? Because a2 is in l2_1 initially, but after step15, a2 is in l1_1. So after step15, a2 is in l1_1, and can be used to transport p1 from l1_1 to l2_1.

But let's see:

After step19, p2 is back in l1_4. For p1:

20. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 → but t1 is in l1_4 after step19. So drive t1 to l1_5:

20. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1
21. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
22. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
23. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
24. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (a2 is in l1_1 after step15)
25. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
26. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 → p1 in l2_1 (constraint met)
27. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
28. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
29. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 → p1 in l2_3.

This reduces some steps. But steps 20-29 are 10 steps for p1. Combined with steps 1-19 for p2, total 29 steps. Still long.

But maybe there's a way to avoid moving p2 back and forth. Wait, the goal requires p2 to be in l1_4, which is its initial location. So if during the plan, p2 is never moved from l1_4, then the goal is already satisfied. But the constraint says that if p1 is ever in l2_1, then p2 must have been in l2_3 earlier. However, p2 is in l1_4 initially. So if we can find a way to have p2 be in l2_3 during the plan, then move p1 through l2_1, and then leave p2 in l1_4. But how? Because to have p2 in l2_3 at any point, we have to move it there and then move it back, which requires steps. But maybe the initial state already has p2 in l1_4, so if we never move it, the goal is satisfied, but the constraint isn't. Because the constraint requires that p1 is in l2_1 at least once, which triggers the requirement that p2 was in l2_3 before.

So we have to move p2 to l2_3 at least once before p1 is in l2_1.

But since p2 starts in l1_4, we can't avoid moving it to l2_3. So the minimal steps would involve moving p2 to l2_3, then p1 to l2_1, then p1 to l2_3, and p2 back to l1_4. But this requires a lot of steps.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to have p2 moved to l2_3 and then left there, but the goal requires p2 to be in l1_4, so that's not possible. Hence, moving p2 to l2_3 and back is necessary.

The minimal plan must include:

- Moving p2 to l2_3.
- Moving p1 through l2_1.
- Moving p2 back to l1_4.
- Moving p1 to l2_3.

But how to do this optimally.

Let me try to find the shortest possible plan.

Let me outline the steps:

For p2:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
4. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
6. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
7. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
8. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
9. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
10. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 → p2 in l2_3.

For p1:

11. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1 (t1 is in l1_1 after step2)
12. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
13. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
14. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
15. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 → but a1 is in l2_1 after step5. So this is impossible. So need to fly a1 back.

Thus:

15. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1 (now a1 is back in l1_1)
16. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
17. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
18. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 → p1 in l2_1 (constraint met)
19. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2 (t2 is in l2_3 after step10)
20. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
21. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
22. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 → p1 in goal.

For p2 to return:

23. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
24. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
25. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
26. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (a1 is in l2_1 after step17)
27. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
28. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
29. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (t1 is in l1_1 after step14)
30. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
31. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 → p2 back.

Total steps: 31. This is not optimal. But maybe there's a way to optimize.

Wait, after step10, p2 is in l2_3. Then, after step22, p1 is in l2_3. Then steps23-31 to move p2 back.

But perhaps we can move p2 back using a different airplane. For example, after step10, p2 is in l2_3. Then use truck t2 to move it back to l2_1, then load into a2 (which is in l2_1 initially), fly to l1_1, then use t1 to move to l1_4.

So:

Steps for p2 return:

23. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2 (t2 is in l2_3 after step10)
24. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
25. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 → p2 in l2_1
26. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
27. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
28. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
29. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
30. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
31. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 → p2 back.

This saves a few steps compared to using a1 for returning p2.

So the plan becomes:

For p2:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
4. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
6. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
7. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
8. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
9. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
10. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 → p2 in l2_3.

For p1:

11. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
12. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
13. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
14. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
15. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
16. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
17. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
18. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 → p1 in l2_1 (constraint met)
19. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2 → t2 is in l2_3 after step10.
20. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
21. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
22. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 → p1 in goal.

For p2 return:

23. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2 → t2 is in l2_3 after step22.
24. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 → but p2 is still in l2_3. Wait, no. After step10, p2 is in l2_3. But after step22, p2 is still in l2_3. So to move p2 back:

23. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (t2 is in l2_3 after step22)
24. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
25. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
26. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
27. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
28. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
29. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (t1 is in l1_1 after step15)
30. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
31. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 → p2 back.

This is still 31 steps. Not optimal.

Wait, maybe the order of moving p1 and p2 can be interleaved to save steps.

For example:

After step10 (p2 in l2_3), start moving p1 while moving p2 back.

But the key is to ensure that when p1 is in l2_1 (step18), there was a previous state where p2 was in l2_3 (step10).

So steps 1-10 for p2.

Then steps 11-18 for p1.

Then steps 19-23 for p2's return.

But how to minimize steps.

Alternatively, perhaps after step10, instead of moving p2 back, we can use the same truck t2 to move both p1 and p2. But since they are different packages, perhaps we can load them into the same truck.

But after step10, t2 is in l2_3. p2 is in l2_3. p1 needs to get to l2_3. So:

After step18 (p1 in l2_1), drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1, load p1, drive to l2_3, unload.

Then, load p2 into t2, drive back to l2_1, load into a2, fly to l1_1, etc.

But this might save steps.

Let's try:

After step10:

p2 in l2_3 (t2 in l2_3).

Steps for p1:

11. fly a1 back to l1_1.

12. move p1 to l1_1.

13. fly to l2_1.

14. unload p1 in l2_1.

15. drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1.

16. load p1 into t2.

17. drive to l2_3, unload.

Then for p2:

18. load p2 into t2.

19. drive to l2_1.

20. unload, load into a2, fly to l1_1, etc.

This might reduce steps.

But this is getting too convoluted. Let me try to find the minimal steps.

Alternative approach: Since p2 must be in l2_3 before p1 is in l2_1, and p2 must end up in l1_4, perhaps the optimal plan is:

1. Move p2 to l2_3 using a1 and t2.

2. Move p1 to l2_3 using a1 and t2, ensuring p1 passes through l2_1.

3. Move p2 back using a2 and t1.

But let's outline:

Step 1: Move p2 from l1_4 to l2_3.

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1

3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

4. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

6. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

7. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2

8. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

9. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2

10. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 → p2 in l2_3.

Step 2: Move p1 from l1_5 to l2_3, passing through l2_1.

11. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1 (t1 is in l1_1 after step3)

12. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5

13. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1

14. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

15. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 → but a1 is in l2_1. So need to fly a1 back.

15. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1

16. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

17. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

18. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 → p1 in l2_1 (constraint met)

19. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2 (t2 is in l2_3 after step10)

20. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

21. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2

22. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 → p1 in goal.

Step 3: Move p2 back to l1_4.

23. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3

24. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

25. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

26. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

27. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

28. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

29. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (t1 is in l1_1 after step14)

30. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

31. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 → p2 back.

This plan is still 31 steps, which is not optimal.

But perhaps there's a way to use the airplanes more efficiently. For example, after step5, a1 is in l2_1. To move p1, instead of flying a1 back, use a2 to carry p1.

But a2 starts in l2_1. So to use a2 to carry p1, we need to fly a2 to l1_1 first.

So:

After step10 (p2 in l2_3):

11. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

12. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1

13. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5

14. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1

15. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

16. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

17. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1

18. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 → p1 in l2_1 (constraint met)

19. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2

20. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

21. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 → p1 in goal.

Then move p2 back using a1:

22. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3

23. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

24. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

25. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (a1 is still in l2_1 after step5)

26. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1

27. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

28. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

29. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

30. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 → p2 back.

This reduces the steps to 30. Still not great, but better.

But perhaps there's a way to save more steps. For example, when moving p1, after flying a2 to l1_1 (step11), we can load p1 directly into a2 without using t1:

Wait, p1 is in l1_5. To get it to l1_1, we need to use t1.

So steps are necessary.

Another idea: After step10, t2 is in l2_3. When moving p1 to l2_1, then to l2_3, use t2 to carry p1 from l2_1 to l2_3. But t2 is in l2_3. So drive t2 to l2_1, load p1, then drive back.

Thus, after step18 (p1 in l2_1), steps:

19. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

20. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

21. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2

22. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 → p1 in goal.

This uses steps 19-22.

But for p2's return:

23. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3

24. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

25. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

26. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

27. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1

28. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

29. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

30. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

31. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

This is still 31 steps. I'm not seeing a way to shorten it further. Perhaps this is the minimal plan given the constraints. However, the user requests an optimal plan, which is the shortest possible. Given the complexity of the constraints, this might be the case.

But let's check if there's a way to have p2's movement to l2_3 and back combined with p1's movement in a way that overlaps steps.

For example, when returning p2 using a2, maybe we can use the same airplane for p1.

Alternatively, use a2 to transport p1 to l2_1, thereby avoiding the need to move a1 back.

Wait, a2 is in l2_1 initially. So to use a2 to carry p1, we need to fly a2 to l1_1, load p1, then fly back.

So steps:

After step10 (p2 in l2_3):

11. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

12. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1

13. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5

14. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1

15. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

16. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

17. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1

18. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 → p1 in l2_1 (constraint met)

Then move p1 to l2_3 using t2:

19. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

20. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

21. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2

22. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 → p1 in goal.

Then move p2 back using a1:

23. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3

24. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

25. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

26. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

27. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1

28. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

29. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

30. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

31. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 → p2 back.

This is still 31 steps.

I'm starting to think that given the constraints and the initial positions, this is the minimal plan. However, perhaps there's a smarter way that I'm missing. For instance, can we use the same truck for both packages in different cities? No, trucks are city-bound. So t1 can only move in c1, t2 in c2.

Another angle: When moving p1, after loading into a1 and flying to l2_1, use the same airplane a1 to fly p2 back. But this would require multiple flights.

Alternatively, after p2 is in l2_3, use airplane a2 (which is in l2_1) to fly p2 back. But a2 needs to be in l2_1 to be loaded.

But I think the plan outlined earlier is the most optimal possible given the constraints. It meets all requirements and uses the minimal number of steps I can think of.
