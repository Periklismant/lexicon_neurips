Let me analyze this problem step by step:

First, let me understand the initial state:
- Location l1_1 to l1_5 are in city c1
- Location l2_1 to l2_5 are in city c2
- l1_1 and l2_1 are airports
- Truck t1 is in location l1_4
- Truck t2 is in location l2_2
- Package p1 is in location l1_5
- Package p2 is in location l1_4
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (airport in city c1)
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1 (airport in city c2)

The goal is:
- Package p1 should be in location l2_3
- Package p2 should remain in location l1_4

With constraints:
1. At some point p1 must be in location l2_1 (the airport in city c2)
2. Before p1 is in l2_1, p2 must be in location l2_3

Let's plan this out:

First, we need to get p2 to l2_3, then get p1 to l2_1, and finally get p1 to l2_3 while ensuring p2 ends up back at l1_4.

For p2:
1. p2 starts in l1_4
2. We need a truck to move it around in c1
3. Load p2 into truck t1 (already at l1_4)
4. Drive t1 to the airport l1_1
5. Unload p2 at l1_1
6. Load p2 into airplane a1 (already at l1_1)
7. Fly a1 to l2_1 (airport in c2)
8. Unload p2 at l2_1
9. Load p2 into truck t2
10. Drive t2 to l2_3
11. Unload p2 at l2_3
12. [Now we've fulfilled the constraint that p2 must be in l2_3 before p1 is in l2_1]

For p1:
1. p1 starts in l1_5
2. We need to move truck t1 from l1_4 to l1_5
3. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_5
4. Load p1 into truck t1
5. Drive t1 to the airport l1_1
6. Unload p1 at l1_1
7. Load p1 into airplane a1 (which is now at l2_1, so we need to fly it back first)
8. Fly a1 from l2_1 to l1_1
9. Load p1 into a1
10. Fly a1 to l2_1
11. Unload p1 at l2_1 (this satisfies the constraint that p1 must be in l2_1 at some point)
12. Load p1 into truck t2
13. Drive t2 to l2_3
14. Unload p1 at l2_3 (this satisfies the first goal)

Now, we need to get p2 back to l1_4:
1. Load p2 into truck t2
2. Drive t2 to l2_1
3. Unload p2 at l2_1
4. Load p2 into airplane a1
5. Fly a1 to l1_1
6. Unload p2 at l1_1
7. Load p2 into truck t1
8. Drive t1 to l1_4
9. Unload p2 at l1_4 (this satisfies the second goal)

Wait, I realized I made a mistake. Actually, I think the initial state has a mistake. It says "Package t1 is in location l1_4" and "Package t2 is in location l2_2", but t1 and t2 are trucks, not packages. Let me assume t1 and t2 are in l1_4 and l2_2 respectively, and analyze the rest.

Also, it says "Package a1 is in location l1_1" and "Package a2 is in location l2_1", but a1 and a2 are airplanes, not packages. Let me assume a1 and a2 are in l1_1 and l2_1 respectively.

So the corrected initial state is:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_4
- Truck t2 is in location l2_2
- Package p1 is in location l1_5
- Package p2 is in location l1_4
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

Now, let's develop a plan:

1. We need to get p2 to l2_3 first (before p1 is in l2_1), and then get it back to l1_4.
2. We need to get p1 to l2_1 (to satisfy the constraint) and then to l2_3 (to satisfy the goal).

Let's start:

For p2 to get to l2_3:
1. p2 starts in l1_4 where t1 is also located
2. Load p2 into t1
3. Drive t1 to l1_1 (the airport in c1)
4. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1
5. Load p2 into a1
6. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1
7. Unload p2 from a1 at l2_1
8. Load p2 into t2 (but t2 is at l2_2, so we need to drive it to l2_1 first)
9. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1
10. Load p2 into t2
11. Drive t2 to l2_3
12. Unload p2 at l2_3
[Now p2 is in l2_3, satisfying the constraint for p1 to be in l2_1]

For p1 to get to l2_3 (via l2_1):
1. p1 starts in l1_5
2. We need t1 to pick it up, but t1 is now at l1_1
3. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_5
4. Load p1 into t1
5. Drive t1 to l1_1
6. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1
7. Load p1 into a1 (which is now at l2_1, so we need to fly it back)
8. Fly a1 from l2_1 to l1_1
9. Load p1 into a1
10. Fly a1 to l2_1
11. Unload p1 at l2_1 (satisfying the constraint that p1 must be in l2_1 at some point)
12. Load p1 into t2 (which is at l2_3, so we need to drive it to l2_1)
13. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1
14. Load p1 into t2
15. Drive t2 to l2_3
16. Unload p1 at l2_3 (satisfying the first goal)

Now, to get p2 back to l1_4:
1. Load p2 into t2
2. Drive t2 to l2_1
3. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1
4. Load p2 into a1
5. Fly a1 to l1_1
6. Unload p2 from a1 at l1_1
7. Load p2 into t1
8. Drive t1 to l1_4
9. Unload p2 at l1_4 (satisfying the second goal)

Let's make sure this plan is valid:

Initial state:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_4
- Truck t2 is in location l2_2
- Package p1 is in location l1_5
- Package p2 is in location l1_4
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

Action sequence:
1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
4. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
6. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
7. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
8. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
9. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
10. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (p2 is now in l2_3, satisfying constraint precondition)
11. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
12. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
13. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
14. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
15. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
16. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
17. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
18. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 (p1 is now in l2_1, satisfying constraint)
19. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 

Wait a second, there's a problem here. t2 is at l2_3, but p1 is at l2_1. So we can't directly load p1 into t2. Let me correct this:

19. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
20. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
21. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
22. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (p1 is now in l2_3, satisfying first goal)

But now I've moved t2 from l2_3 to l2_1, so p2 is no longer with t2. This means p2 is still at l2_3, and we need to get it back to l1_4.

Let's continue:
23. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
24. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
25. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
26. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
27. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
28. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
29. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
30. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
31. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
32. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (p2 is now in l1_4, satisfying second goal)

Wait, I made a mistake again. Let me trace the plan more carefully:

Initial state:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_4
- Truck t2 is in location l2_2
- Package p1 is in location l1_5
- Package p2 is in location l1_4
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

Step 1: loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
- p2 is now in t1
- t1 is still in l1_4

Step 2: drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
- t1 (with p2) is now in l1_1

Step 3: unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
- p2 is now in l1_1
- t1 is still in l1_1

Step 4: loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
- p2 is now in a1
- a1 is still in l1_1

Step 5: flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
- a1 (with p2) is now in l2_1

Step 6: unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
- p2 is now in l2_1
- a1 is still in l2_1

Step 7: drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
- t2 is now in l2_1

Step 8: loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
- p2 is now in t2
- t2 is still in l2_1

Step 9: drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
- t2 (with p2) is now in l2_3

Step 10: unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
- p2 is now in l2_3
- t2 is still in l2_3
- This satisfies the constraint that p2 must be in l2_3 before p1 is in l2_1

Step 11: drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
- t1 is now in l1_5

Step 12: loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
- p1 is now in t1
- t1 is still in l1_5

Step 13: drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
- t1 (with p1) is now in l1_1

Step 14: unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
- p1 is now in l1_1
- t1 is still in l1_1

Step 15: flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
- a1 is now in l1_1

Step 16: loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
- p1 is now in a1
- a1 is still in l1_1

Step 17: flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
- a1 (with p1) is now in l2_1

Step 18: unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
- p1 is now in l2_1
- a1 is still in l2_1
- This satisfies the constraint that p1 must be in l2_1 at some point

Step 19: drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
- t2 is now in l2_1
- p2 is still in l2_3

Step 20: loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
- p1 is now in t2
- t2 is still in l2_1

Step 21: drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
- t2 (with p1) is now in l2_3

Step 22: unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
- p1 is now in l2_3
- t2 is still in l2_3
- This satisfies the first goal that p1 must be in l2_3

Now, we need to get p2 back to l1_4.

Step 23: loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
- p2 is now in t2
- t2 is still in l2_3

Step 24: drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
- t2 (with p2) is now in l2_1

Step 25: unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
- p2 is now in l2_1
- t2 is still in l2_1

Step 26: loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
- p2 is now in a1
- a1 is still in l2_1

Step 27: flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
- a1 (with p2) is now in l1_1

Step 28: unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
- p2 is now in l1_1
- a1 is still in l1_1

Step 29: loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
- p2 is now in t1
- t1 is still in l1_1

Step 30: drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
- t1 (with p2) is now in l1_4

Step 31: unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
- p2 is now in l1_4
- t1 is still in l1_4
- This satisfies the second goal that p2 must be in l1_4

Let me check if this plan works:

1. We get p2 to l2_3 (steps 1-10)
2. We get p1 to l2_1 (steps 11-18)
3. We get p1 to l2_3 (steps 19-22)
4. We get p2 back to l1_4 (steps 23-31)

The constraints are satisfied:
- p2 is in l2_3 (step 10) before p1 is in l2_1 (step 18)
- p1 is in l2_1 at some point (step 18)

The goals are satisfied:
- p1 is in l2_3 (step 22)
- p2 is in l1_4 (step 31)

I believe this plan is valid and optimal. Here's the final plan:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
4. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
6. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
7. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
8. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
9. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
10. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
11. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
12. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
13. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
14. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
15. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
16. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
17. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
18. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
19. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
20. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
21. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
22. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
23. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
24. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
25. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
26. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
27. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
28. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
29. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
30. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
31. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

Actually, can we make this more optimal? Let's see if there's a shorter plan:

Initial constraints:
- p2 must be in l2_3 before p1 is in l2_1
- p1 must be in l2_1 at some point

Initially, p2 is in l1_4 and p1 is in l1_5, and they need to be delivered to l1_4 and l2_3, respectively.

Let's try a different approach:

1. p2 is already in l1_4, and we want it back there at the end. So instead of moving it through the entire plan, let's just get it to l2_3 and back to l1_4 before the end.
2. p1 needs to go from l1_5 to l2_3, but it must go via l2_1. This means p1 needs to go through the airport.

So, for p1:
1. Use t1 to get p1 from l1_5 to l1_1
2. Use a1 to get p1 from l1_1 to l2_1
3. Use t2 to get p1 from l2_1 to l2_3

For p2:
1. Before p1 reaches l2_1, p2 must be in l2_3
2. After that, p2 must go back to l1_4
3. Let's place p2 in l2_3 by using t1, a1, and t2
4. Then, let's bring p2 back to l1_4 using the reverse route

Ok, I think the plan I have is pretty optimal. Let's double-check it for correctness:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (p2 is in t1 at l1_4)
2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 (t1 with p2 is at l1_1)
3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (p2 is at l1_1, t1 is at l1_1)
4. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (p2 is in a1 at l1_1)
5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (a1 with p2 is at l2_1)
6. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (p2 is at l2_1, a1 is at l2_1)
7. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 (t2 is at l2_1)
8. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (p2 is in t2 at l2_1)
9. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2 (t2 with p2 is at l2_3)
10. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (p2 is at l2_3, t2 is at l2_3) - Constraint 2 is met: p2 is in l2_3
11. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1 (t1 is at l1_5)
12. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 (p1 is in t1 at l1_5)
13. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1 (t1 with p1 is at l1_1)
14. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (p1 is at l1_1, t1 is at l1_1)
15. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1 (a1 is at l1_1)
16. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (p1 is in a1 at l1_1)
17. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (a1 with p1 is at l2_1)
18. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 (p1 is at l2_1, a1 is at l2_1) - Constraint 1 is met: p1 is in l2_1
19. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2 (t2 is at l2_1)
20. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (p1 is in t2 at l2_1)
21. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2 (t2 with p1 is at l2_3)
22. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (p1 is at l2_3, t2 is at l2_3) - Goal 1 is met: p1 is in l2_3
23. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (p2 is in t2 at l2_3)
24. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2 (t2 with p2 is at l2_1)
25. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (p2 is at l2_1, t2 is at l2_1)
26. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (p2 is in a1 at l2_1)
27. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1 (a1 with p2 is at l1_1)
28. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (p2 is at l1_1, a1 is at l1_1)
29. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (p2 is in t1 at l1_1)
30. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1 (t1 with p2 is at l1_4)
31. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (p2 is at l1_4, t1 is at l1_4) - Goal 2 is met: p2 is in l1_4

This plan is valid and satisfies all constraints and goals.

Actually, looking at this plan, I wonder if I can optimize it by having p2 stay at l1_4 the whole time? Let's see:

The goal state requires:
- p1 in l2_3
- p2 in l1_4 (which is where p2 starts)

The constraints require:
- p1 must be in l2_1 at some point
- Before p1 is in l2_1, p2 must be in l2_3

So I need to:
1. Get p2 from l1_4 to l2_3 (to satisfy the constraint)
2. Get p1 to l2_1 (to satisfy the constraint) and then to l2_3 (to satisfy the goal)
3. Get p2 back to l1_4 (to satisfy the goal)

There's no way to satisfy these constraints without moving p2 from l1_4 to l2_3 and then back. So our plan is indeed minimal.

Actually, let me again check that I haven't made any mistakes (which I'm prone to doing):

The goal is: p1 in l2_3 and p2 in l1_4
Initial state: p1 in l1_5 and p2 in l1_4

Constraints:
1. p1 must be in l2_1 at some point
2. Before p1 is in l2_1, p2 must be in l2_3

Overall strategy:
1. Move p2 from l1_4 to l2_3 (satisfying constraint 2)
2. Move p1 from l1_5 to l2_1 (satisfying constraint 1) and then to l2_3 (satisfying goal 1)
3. Move p2 from l2_3 back to l1_4 (satisfying goal 2)

Detailed steps:
1. Get p2 from l1_4 to l2_3
   - Use t1 to get p2 from l1_4 to l1_1 (airport in c1)
   - Use a1 to get p2 from l1_1 to l2_1 (airport in c2)
   - Use t2 to get p2 from l2_1 to l2_3
2. Get p1 from l1_5 to l2_3 (via l2_1)
   - Use t1 to get p1 from l1_5 to l1_1
   - Use a1 to get p1 from l1_1 to l2_1
   - Use t2 to get p1 from l2_1 to l2_3
3. Get p2 from l2_3 back to l1_4
   - Use t2 to get p2 from l2_3 to l2_1
   - Use a1 to get p2 from l2_1 to l1_1
   - Use t1 to get p2 from l1_1 to l1_4

This plan looks good. Let me now check that our original step-by-step plan aligns with this strategy:

Steps 1-10: Move p2 from l1_4 to l2_3
Steps 11-22: Move p1 from l1_5 to l2_3 (via l2_1)
Steps 23-31: Move p2 from l2_3 back to l1_4

Yes, this looks correct. Our plan satisfies all constraints and goals, and I believe it's optimal.

Let me restate the optimal plan:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
