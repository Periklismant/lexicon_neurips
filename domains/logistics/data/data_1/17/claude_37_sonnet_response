Okay, I need to analyze this problem step by step to find an optimal plan.

First, let me summarize the initial state:
- Locations: l1_1 to l1_5 in city c1, l2_1 to l2_5 in city c2
- Airports: l1_1 in city c1, l2_1 in city c2
- Package p1 is in location l2_2 (city c2)
- Package p2 is in location l2_4 (city c2)
- Truck t1 is in location l1_2 (city c1)
- Truck t2 is in location l2_4 (city c2)
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (city c1, airport)
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1 (city c2, airport)

The goal is:
- Package p1 should be in location l2_2 (city c2)
- Package p2 should be in location l1_5 (city c1)

And there's a constraint:
- At some point in the plan, p1 must be in l2_4 AND p2 must be in l1_3

Let me analyze the goal and constraint:
1. p1 starts in l2_2 and must end in l2_2
2. But during the plan, p1 must visit l2_4 (both in city c2)
3. p2 starts in l2_4 (city c2) and must end in l1_5 (city c1)
4. And during the plan, p2 must visit l1_3 (city c1)

This means:
- p1 needs to move from l2_2 to l2_4 and then back to l2_2
- p2 needs to move from l2_4 to l1_3 and then to l1_5

Let me start planning:

For p1:
- Need to use t2 (in city c2) to move p1 from l2_2 to l2_4 and back

For p2:
- Need to use t2 (in city c2) to bring p2 to airport l2_1
- Then use airplane (a1 or a2) to fly p2 to airport l1_1 in city c1
- Then use t1 (in city c1) to move p2 from l1_1 to l1_3 and then to l1_5

Let me build the detailed plan:

First, I need to bring t2 to l2_2 to pick up p1:
1. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2

Now load p1 into t2:
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

Drive to l2_4 to satisfy the constraint for p1:
3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2

At this point, p1 is in l2_4 (in truck t2). p2 is already in l2_4.
Load p2 into t2:
4. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

Now drive to l2_1 (airport) to transfer p2 to an airplane:
5. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2

Unload p2 at the airport:
6. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

Now we need to use an airplane to move p2 to city c1. We can use a2 which is already at l2_1:
7. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
8. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

Now p2 is at airport l1_1 in city c1. We need to get truck t1 to pick it up:
9. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
10. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
11. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

Now we need to drive t1 to l1_3 to satisfy the constraint for p2:
12. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1

At this point, p2 is in l1_3 (in truck t1). Now we need to fulfill the goal for p2:
13. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_5 c1
14. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

Now let's complete the goal for p1. We need to drive t2 back to l2_2:
15. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
16. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

But wait, I realized there's an issue. At step 3, we have p1 in truck t2 at l2_4, but we haven't fulfilled the constraint yet because p2 is not in l1_3 at that point. We need to revise our plan.

Let's try a different approach:

First, let's move p2 from l2_4 to l1_3 (to prepare for the constraint):
1. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
2. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
3. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
4. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
5. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
6. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
7. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
8. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
9. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1

Now we've got p2 in l1_3 (in truck t1). We need to move p1 to l2_4 to fulfill the constraint:
10. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
11. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
12. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2

At this point, we have p1 in l2_4 (in truck t2) and p2 in l1_3 (in truck t1), fulfilling our constraint.

Now we complete the goals:
13. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2
14. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
15. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_5 c1
16. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

But I'm actually confused about something in the initial state. It says:

"Package t1 is in location l1_2"
"Package t2 is in location l2_4"
"Package p1 is in location l2_2"
"Package p2 is in location l2_4"
"Package a1 is in location l1_1"
"Package a2 is in location l2_1"

Are t1, t2, a1, and a2 packages or vehicles? Based on the actions described, they should be vehicles (trucks and airplanes), not packages. Let me assume they are vehicles rather than packages:

- Truck t1 is in location l1_2 (city c1)
- Truck t2 is in location l2_4 (city c2)
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (city c1, airport)
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1 (city c2, airport)
- Package p1 is in location l2_2 (city c2)
- Package p2 is in location l2_4 (city c2)

With this correction, my plan should work. Let me check it once more:

1. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4  (load p2 into truck t2 at l2_4)
2. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2  (drive t2 to airport l2_1)
3. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1  (unload p2 at airport)
4. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1  (load p2 into airplane a2)
5. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1  (fly a2 to airport l1_1 in city c1)
6. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1  (unload p2 at l1_1)
7. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1  (drive t1 to airport l1_1)
8. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1  (load p2 into truck t1)
9. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1  (drive t1 to l1_3)

At this point, p2 is in l1_3 (in truck t1). Now we need to move p1 to l2_4 to fulfill the constraint:

10. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2  (drive t2 to l2_2)
11. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2  (load p1 into truck t2)
12. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2  (drive t2 to l2_4)

At this point, we have p1 in l2_4 (in truck t2) and p2 in l1_3 (in truck t1), fulfilling our constraint.

Now we complete the goals:

13. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2  (drive t2 back to l2_2)
14. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2  (unload p1 at l2_2, fulfilling first goal)
15. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_5 c1  (drive t1 to l1_5)
16. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5  (unload p2 at l1_5, fulfilling second goal)

This plan should now meet the goal and the constraint.

But wait, I just realized I may have misunderstood something. Let me check the unloadairplane action. The definition says:

"loadairplane p ap l": Unload package p from airplane ap in location l.

This appears to be a typo. I think it should be "unloadairplane" rather than repeating "loadairplane". I'll assume it means unloadairplane.

Let me also make sure I understand the constraint correctly. The constraint states:
"The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'The following conditions are all true: "Package p1 is in location l2_4", "Package p2 is in location l1_3"'"

This means there must be a point in our plan where p1 is in l2_4 AND p2 is in l1_3 simultaneously. Looking at my plan, this happens right after step 12 when p1 is in l2_4 (in truck t2) and p2 is in l1_3 (in truck t1).

But wait, the constraint requires that "Package p1 is in location l2_4" and "Package p2 is in location l1_3", not "Package p1 is in truck t2 which is in location l2_4". I need to ensure that p1 is actually in location l2_4, not just in a truck at that location.

Let me revise the plan:

1. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4  (load p2 into truck t2 at l2_4)
2. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2  (drive t2 to airport l2_1)
3. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1  (unload p2 at airport)
4. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1  (load p2 into airplane a2)
5. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1  (fly a2 to airport l1_1 in city c1)
6. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1  (unload p2 at l1_1)
7. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1  (drive t1 to airport l1_1)
8. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1  (load p2 into truck t1)
9. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1  (drive t1 to l1_3)
10. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3  (unload p2 at l1_3)

At this point, p2 is in l1_3. Now we need to move p1 to l2_4 to fulfill the constraint:

11. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2  (drive t2 to l2_2)
12. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2  (load p1 into truck t2)
13. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2  (drive t2 to l2_4)
14. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4  (unload p1 at l2_4)

At this point, we have p1 in l2_4 and p2 in l1_3, fulfilling our constraint.

Now we complete the goals. First, pick up p1 again:

15. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4  (load p1 back into truck t2)
16. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2  (drive t2 back to l2_2)
17. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2  (unload p1 at l2_2, fulfilling first goal)

Now complete the goal for p2:

18. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3  (load p2 back into truck t1)
19. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_5 c1  (drive t1 to l1_5)
20. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5  (unload p2 at l1_5, fulfilling second goal)

This plan should now meet the goal and the constraint correctly.

Actually, I notice that we can optimize this plan further. Since p1 starts and ends at l2_2, we can make its trip to l2_4 more efficient. And since we're moving p2 from l2_4 to l1_5, we can coordinate this better:

1. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4  (load p2 into truck t2 at l2_4)
2. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2  (drive t2 to l2_2, where p1 is)
3. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2  (load p1 into truck t2)
4. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2  (drive t2 back to l2_4)
5. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4  (unload p1 at l2_4)

Now we have p1 in l2_4. We need to move p2 to l1_3 to fulfill the constraint:

6. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2  (drive t2 to airport l2_1)
7. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1  (unload p2 at airport)
8. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1  (load p2 into airplane a2)
9. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1  (fly a2 to airport l1_1 in city c1)
10. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1  (unload p2 at l1_1)
11. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1  (drive t1 to airport l1_1)
12. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1  (load p2 into truck t1)
13. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1  (drive t1 to l1_3)
14. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3  (unload p2 at l1_3)

At this point, we have p1 in l2_4 and p2 in l1_3, fulfilling our constraint.

Now we complete the goals:

15. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4  (load p1 back into truck t2)
16. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2  (drive t2 back to l2_2)
17. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2  (unload p1 at l2_2, fulfilling first goal)
18. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3  (load p2 back into truck t1)
19. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_5 c1  (drive t1 to l1_5)
20. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5  (unload p2 at l1_5, fulfilling second goal)

But wait, actually, there's something wrong in my initial state understanding. I need to clarify:

"Package t1 is in location l1_2"
"Package t2 is in location l2_4"
"Package p1 is in location l2_2"
"Package p2 is in location l2_4"
"Package a1 is in location l1_1"
"Package a2 is in location l2_1"

If t1, t2, a1, a2 are all packages, that would be confusing because we need trucks and airplanes for transportation. Let me assume these are typos and the correct understanding is:

- Truck t1 is in location l1_2 (city c1)
- Truck t2 is in location l2_4 (city c2)
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (city c1, airport)
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1 (city c2, airport)
- Package p1 is in location l2_2 (city c2)
- Package p2 is in location l2_4 (city c2)

With this understanding, my optimized plan should be valid.

Actually, let me check if we can optimize this further. Since p1 starts at l2_2 and must end at l2_2, we need to move it to l2_4 temporarily to satisfy the constraint, but we can be more efficient with the movement of vehicles:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2  (drive t2 to l2_2, where p1 is)
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2  (load p1 into truck t2)
3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2  (drive t2 back to l2_4)
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4  (unload p1 at l2_4)
5. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4  (load p2 into truck t2)
6. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2  (drive t2 to airport l2_1)
7. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1  (unload p2 at airport)
8. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1  (load p2 into airplane a2)
9. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1  (fly a2 to airport l1_1 in city c1)
10. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1  (unload p2 at l1_1)
11. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1  (drive t1 to airport l1_1)
12. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1  (load p2 into truck t1)
13. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1  (drive t1 to l1_3)
14. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3  (unload p2 at l1_3)

At this point, p1 is in l2_4 and p2 is in l1_3, satisfying our constraint.

15. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4  (load p1 back into truck t2)
16. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2  (drive t2 back to l2_2)
17. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2  (unload p1 at l2_2, fulfilling first goal)
18. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3  (load p2 back into truck t1)
19. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_5 c1  (drive t1 to l1_5)
20. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5  (unload p2 at l1_5, fulfilling second goal)

This plan should be optimal.

Let me review the plan one more time to ensure it's optimal:

For p1:
- Starts at l2_2, moves to l2_4 (for constraint), then back to l2_2 (for goal)
- This is the minimal movement needed

For p2:
- Starts at l2_4, moves to l1_3 (for constraint), then to l1_5 (for goal)
- This involves:
  - Truck ride from l2_4 to airport l2_1
  - Flight from l2_1 to l1_1
  - Truck ride from l1_1 to l1_3 to l1_5
- This seems like the minimal transportation needed

For trucks and airplanes:
- t1 moves from l1_2 to l1_1 to l1_3 to l1_5
- t2 moves from l2_4 to l2_2 to l2_4 to l2_1 to l2_4 to l2_2
- a2 moves from l2_1 to l1_1
- a1 doesn't move (not needed)

The plan takes 20 steps, which seems optimal given the constraints.

After thinking about it once more, I'm wondering if we can parallelize some operations. For example, while we're transporting p2 from city c2 to city c1, we could already be moving p1 to l2_4. However, since the constraint requires both p1 to be in l2_4 and p2 to be in l1_3 simultaneously, we need to time their arrivals carefully.

Let me check if there's a way to reduce the number of steps:

Step 1-5: Get p1 to l2_4
Step 6-14: Get p2 to l1_3
Step 15-20: Return p1 to l2_2 and move p2 to l1_5

These sequences can't be parallelized much because of the constraint. However, we might save a step by reordering some actions:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2  (drive t2 to l2_2, where p1 is)
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2  (load p1 into truck t2)
3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2  (drive t2 back to l2_4)
4. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4  (load p2 into truck t2)
5. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4  (unload p1 at l2_4)
6. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2  (drive t2 to airport l2_1)
7. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1  (unload p2 at airport)
8. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1  (load p2 into airplane a2)
9. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1  (fly a2 to airport l1_1 in city c1)
10. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1  (unload p2 at l1_1)
11. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1  (drive t1 to airport l1_1)
12. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1  (load p2 into truck t1)
13. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1  (drive t1 to l1_3)
14. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3  (unload p2 at l1_3)

At this point, p1 is in l2_4 and p2 is in l1_3, satisfying our constraint.

15. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2  (drive t2 back to l2_4)
16. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4  (load p1 back into truck t2)
17. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2  (drive t2 back to l2_2)
18. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2  (unload p1 at l2_2, fulfilling first goal)
19. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3  (load p2 back into truck t1)
20. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_5 c1  (drive t1 to l1_5)
21. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5  (unload p2 at l1_5, fulfilling second goal)

This plan is 21 steps, which is actually one step more than the previous plan. The issue is that I had to add an extra step for t2 to drive back from l2_1 to l2_4 to pick up p1 again after dropping off p2.

Let me try another approach:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2  (drive t2 to l2_2, where p1 is)
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2  (load p1 into truck t2)
3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2  (drive t2 back to l2_4)
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4  (unload p1 at l2_4)

Now, p1 is at l2_4, satisfying part of our constraint. Let's move p2:

5. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4  (load p2 into truck t2)
6. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2  (drive t2 to airport l2_1)
7. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1  (unload p2 at airport)
8. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1  (load p2 into airplane a2)
9. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1  (fly a2 to airport l1_1 in city c1)
10. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1  (unload p2 at l1_1)
11. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1  (drive t1 to airport l1_1)
12. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1  (load p2 into truck t1)
13. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1  (drive t1 to l1_3)
14. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3  (unload p2 at l1_3)

At this point, p1 is in l2_4 and p2 is in l1_3, satisfying our constraint.

Now, finish the goal for p1 first:

15. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2  (drive t2 back to l2_4)
16. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4  (load p1 back into truck t2)
17. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2  (drive t2 back to l2_2)
18. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2  (unload p1 at l2_2, fulfilling first goal)

And finish the goal for p2:

19. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3  (load p2 back into truck t1)
20. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_5 c1  (drive t1 to l1_5)
21. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5  (unload p2 at l1_5, fulfilling second goal)

This plan is still 21 steps. Let me see if there's another approach that could be more efficient.

Actually, let me try a completely different approach. What if we move p1 after handling p2?

1. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4  (load p2 into truck t2 at l2_4)
2. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2  (drive t2 to airport l2_1)
3. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1  (unload p2 at airport)
4. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1  (load p2 into airplane a2)
5. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1  (fly a2 to airport l1_1 in city c1)
6. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1  (unload p2 at l1_1)
7. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1  (drive t1 to airport l1_1)
8. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1  (load p2 into truck t1)
9. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1  (drive t1 to l1_3)
10. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3  (unload p2 at l1_3)

At this point, p2 is in l1_3. Now let's move p1 to l2_4 to satisfy the constraint:

11. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2  (drive t2 to l2_2)
12. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2  (load p1 into truck t2)
13. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2  (drive t2 to l2_4)
14. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4  (unload p1 at l2_4)

At this point, p1 is in l2_4 and p2 is in l1_3, satisfying our constraint.

Now, let's complete the goals:

15. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4  (load p1 back into truck t2)
16. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2  (drive t2 back to l2_2)
17. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2  (unload p1 at l2_2, fulfilling first goal)
18. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3  (load p2 back into truck t1)
19. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_5 c1  (drive t1 to l1_5)
20. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5  (unload p2 at l1_5, fulfilling second goal)

This plan is 20 steps, which seems to be the minimum given our constraints.

Let me check once more if there's any way to optimize this further:

For p1:
- Must move from l2_2 to l2_4 and back to l2_2
- This requires at least 5 steps (1 to load, 1 to drive, 1 to unload, 1 to load again, 1 to drive back, 1 to unload) = 6 steps minimum

For p2:
- Must move from l2_4 to l1_3 to l1_5
- This requires at least 3 steps for loading/unloading, 3 steps for transportation between cities, 2 steps for truck movement in city c1 = 8 steps minimum

Combining these, and considering the constraint that p1 must be in l2_4 while p2 is in l1_3, we need at least 14 steps for the essential movements. The remaining steps are for truck positioning and such, which seem unavoidable.

After careful analysis, I believe my 20-step plan is optimal:

1. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4  (load p2 into truck t2 at l2_4)
2. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2  (drive t2 to airport l2_1)
3. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1  (unload p2 at airport)
4. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1  (load p2 into airplane a2)
5. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1  (fly a2 to airport l1_1 in city c1)
6. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1  (unload p2 at l1_1)
7. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1  (drive t1 to airport l1_1)

9. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1  (drive t1 to l1_3)
10. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3  (unload p2 at l1_3)
11. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2  (drive t2 to l2_2)
12. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2  (load p1 into truck t2)
13. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2  (drive t2 to l2_4)
14. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4  (unload p1 at l2_4)
15. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4  (load p1 back into truck t2)
16. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2  (drive t2 back to l2_2)
17. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2  (unload p1 at l2_2, fulfilling first goal)
18. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3  (load p2 back into truck t1)
19. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_5 c1  (drive t1 to l1_5)
20. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5  (unload p2 at l1_5, fulfilling second goal)

So this is my optimal plan. I will finally notice I am repeating the "unloadtruck" operation immediately followed by "loadtruck" for p1 at l2_4 (steps 14-15). Let me simplify this:

1. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4  (load p2 into truck t2 at l2_4)
2. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2  (drive t2 to airport l2_1)
3. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1  (unload p2 at airport)
4. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1  (load p2 into airplane a2)
5. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1  (fly a2 to airport l1_1 in city c1)
6. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1  (unload p2 at l1_1)
7. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1  (drive t1 to airport l1_1)
8. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1  (load p2 into truck t1)
9. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1  (drive t1 to l1_3)
10. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3  (unload p2 at l1_3)
11. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2  (drive t2 to l2_2)
12. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2  (load p1 into truck t2)
13. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2  (drive t2 to l2_4)
14. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4  (unload p1 at l2_4)

At this point, p1 is in l2_4 and p2 is in l1_3, satisfying our constraint.

15. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4  (load p1 back into truck t2)
16. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2  (drive t2 back to l2_2)
17. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2  (unload p1 at l2_2, fulfilling first goal)
18. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3  (load p2 back into truck t1)
19. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_5 c1  (drive t1 to l1_5)
20. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5  (unload p2 at l1_5, fulfilling second goal)

I recognize that the constraint requires p1 to be physically in l2_4 and p2 to be physically in l1_3, not just in vehicles at those locations. So I need the unload/load steps at those points. This 20-step plan seems optimal to me.

Okay, the final plan is:

1. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
2. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
3. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
4. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
5. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
6. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
7. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
8. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
9. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
10. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
11. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
12. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
13. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2
14. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
15. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
16. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2
17. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
18. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
19. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_5 c1
20. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
