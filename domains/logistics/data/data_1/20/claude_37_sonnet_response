Let me analyze the problem.

We have:
- Cities c1 and c2.
- Locations l1_1, l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5, l2_1, l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5.
- Locations l1_1 to l1_5 are in city c1.
- Locations l2_1 to l2_5 are in city c2.
- l1_1 and l2_1 are airports.
- Packages p1 and p2.
- Trucks t1 and t2.
- Airplanes a1 and a2.

Initial state:
- Package t1 is in location l1_3
- Package t2 is in location l2_5
- Package p1 is in location l2_2
- Package p2 is in location l2_2
- Package a1 is in location l1_1
- Package a2 is in location l2_1

Wait, there's something strange in the initial state. The packages are described as "Package t1", "Package t2", etc. But t1 and t2 are trucks, not packages. And a1 and a2 are airplanes, not packages. This seems like an error in the problem description. Let me reinterpret the initial state based on the objects provided:

- Truck t1 is in location l1_3
- Truck t2 is in location l2_5
- Package p1 is in location l2_2
- Package p2 is in location l2_2
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

Goal:
- Package p1 is in location l2_4
- Package p2 is in location l2_1

Constraints:
- In at least one state, Package p2 is in location l2_4.

Let's plan for this:

1. We need to move p1 from l2_2 to l2_4.
2. We need to move p2 from l2_2 to l2_1. But before making the final move, we need to ensure p2 visits l2_4.

Since p1 and p2 are both in city c2, we can use truck t2 to transport them. But t2 is currently at l2_5. So, we first need to drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2.

Let's form the plan:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
3. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
4. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2 // This satisfies the constraint of having p2 in l2_4 at least once
5. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 // p1 is now at its goal location
6. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
7. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 // p2 is now at its goal location

Let's verify:

1. Initial state: t2 at l2_5, p1 at l2_2, p2 at l2_2.
2. After drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2: t2 at l2_2, p1 at l2_2, p2 at l2_2.
3. After loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2: t2 at l2_2, p1 in t2, p2 at l2_2.
4. After loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2: t2 at l2_2, p1 in t2, p2 in t2.
5. After drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2: t2 at l2_4, p1 in t2, p2 in t2. Constraint satisfied: p2 is in l2_4 (inside t2).
6. After unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4: t2 at l2_4, p1 at l2_4, p2 in t2. Goal 1 satisfied: p1 is at l2_4.
7. After drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2: t2 at l2_1, p1 at l2_4, p2 in t2.
8. After unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1: t2 at l2_1, p1 at l2_4, p2 at l2_1. Goal 2 satisfied: p2 is at l2_1.

Hmm, I'm a bit unsure about the interpretation of the constraint. It says: "Package p2 is in location l2_4". But does "is in location" really mean the package is physically at the location, or could it also mean it's inside a truck or airplane that's at that location?

Let me recheck the domain action effects to be sure.

For "loadtruck", if the package is loaded into a truck, the effect is that the package is no longer situated in the location, but instead is "in" the truck. The domain doesn't seem to have a concept of a package being "in" a location via a vehicle. 

So, the constraint should be interpreted as "Package p2 is physically at location l2_4". This means we need to ensure p2 is actually unloaded at l2_4 at some point in the plan.

Let me revise the plan:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
3. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
4. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2
5. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 // p1 is now at its goal location
6. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 // Satisfies the constraint
7. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
8. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
9. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 // p2 is now at its goal location

Now, let's verify:

1. Initial state: t2 at l2_5, p1 at l2_2, p2 at l2_2.
2. After drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2: t2 at l2_2, p1 at l2_2, p2 at l2_2.
3. After loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2: t2 at l2_2, p1 in t2, p2 at l2_2.
4. After loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2: t2 at l2_2, p1 in t2, p2 in t2.
5. After drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2: t2 at l2_4, p1 in t2, p2 in t2.
6. After unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4: t2 at l2_4, p1 at l2_4, p2 in t2. Goal 1 satisfied: p1 is at l2_4.
7. After unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4: t2 at l2_4, p1 at l2_4, p2 at l2_4. Constraint satisfied: p2 is at l2_4.
8. After loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4: t2 at l2_4, p1 at l2_4, p2 in t2.
9. After drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2: t2 at l2_1, p1 at l2_4, p2 in t2.
10. After unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1: t2 at l2_1, p1 at l2_4, p2 at l2_1. Goal 2 satisfied: p2 is at l2_1.

Both goals and the constraint are satisfied by this plan. It's a valid plan with 9 steps.

But let me reconsider one more time the constraint. It says "The following expression must hold in at least one state". 

Wait, one more thing to check. Is it possible to get p2 to l2_4 if it's in an airplane? Let's consider using an airplane.

Airplanes can only move between airports, and the airports are l1_1 and l2_1. But p2 starts at l2_2 and needs to be at l2_1. Even if we use an airplane to move p2 from one city to another, it still needs a truck to transport it within the city.

So, in this particular problem, it doesn't make sense to use airplanes to move p2 since the source and destination are in the same city. It's more direct to just use a truck.

I believe the plan provided is optimal and satisfies all requirements.

Ah, I missed something in the problem. The constraint says that p2 should be physically at l2_4, i.e., not inside a truck. This was confused by my earlier misunderstanding about the description of the initial state. 

Alright, here's the revised plan. Note that I'm reusing the correct interpretation of the initial state:

Initial state:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_3
- Truck t2 is in location l2_5
- Package p1 is in location l2_2
- Package p2 is in location l2_2
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
3. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
4. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2
5. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 // p1 is now at its goal location
6. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 // Satisfies the constraint
7. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
8. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
9. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 // p2 is now at its goal location

Let's trace through the execution of this plan one more time to ensure it's valid:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
   - Precondition: t2 is at l2_5 and both l2_5 and l2_2 are in city c2. This is true.
   - Effect: t2 moves from l2_5 to l2_2.

2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
   - Precondition: p1 and t2 are both at l2_2. This is true.
   - Effect: p1 is loaded into t2.

3. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
   - Precondition: p2 and t2 are both at l2_2. This is true.
   - Effect: p2 is loaded into t2.

4. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2
   - Precondition: t2 is at l2_2 and both l2_2 and l2_4 are in city c2. This is true.
   - Effect: t2 moves from l2_2 to l2_4.

5. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
   - Precondition: t2 is at l2_4 and p1 is in t2. This is true.
   - Effect: p1 is unloaded at l2_4.

6. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
   - Precondition: t2 is at l2_4 and p2 is in t2. This is true.
   - Effect: p2 is unloaded at l2_4. This satisfies the constraint.

7. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
   - Precondition: p2 and t2 are both at l2_4. This is true.
   - Effect: p2 is loaded into t2.

8. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
   - Precondition: t2 is at l2_4 and both l2_4 and l2_1 are in city c2. This is true.
   - Effect: t2 moves from l2_4 to l2_1.

9. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
   - Precondition: t2 is at l2_1 and p2 is in t2. This is true.
   - Effect: p2 is unloaded at l2_1.

By the end of this plan, p1 is at l2_4 and p2 is at l2_1, which satisfies the main goal. Additionally, at one point (after step 6), p2 was at l2_4, which satisfies the constraint.

This plan is valid and optimal for the given problem.

Let's double-check one more time that all the facts in the plan description are correct.

In the original problem description, there was a mistake where it seemed like packages t1, t2, a1, and a2 existed, but these are supposed to be trucks and airplanes. The problem also seems to define loadairplane twice, once for loading and once for unloading. I'll interpret the second occurrence as unloadairplane.

Let's form the plan:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
3. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
4. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2
5. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 // p1 is now at its goal location
6. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 // Satisfies the constraint
7. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
8. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
9. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 // p2 is now at its goal location

The provided actions and their preconditions and effects are consistent with this plan. The plan is valid and optimal.

Time to convert to the format requested:

```
drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
```

Let me check one more time. I'm not 100% sure of the interpretation of "Package t1 is in location l1_3" from the original state. Is t1 a package or a truck? If it's a truck, the initial state would be:

- Truck t1 is in location l1_3
- Truck t2 is in location l2_5
- Package p1 is in location l2_2
- Package p2 is in location l2_2
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

Which is consistent with the objects provided. If t1 and t2 are packages, then we'd have a different set of objects than what was provided.

I'll go with the interpretation that t1 and t2 are trucks, and a1 and a2 are airplanes.

One last thing to check: is the constraint the one that requires an optimal plan? Yes, the problem statement asks for an optimal plan, i.e., a valid plan whose length is equal or less than the length of any other valid plan.

The plan I've provided is optimal. It moves packages p1 and p2 from their initial locations to their goal locations while ensuring p2 visits l2_4. It's not possible to skip any of the steps without compromising the goal or the constraint.

Actually, let me double-check the constraint. The constraint says: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'Package p2 is in location l2_4'". This means that at some point during the execution of the plan, p2 must be in l2_4. This is ensured by steps 6 and the fact that after step 6, p2 is unloaded in l2_4.

So, the plan is valid and optimal.

```
drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
```

Hmm, wait… what about a potentially more efficient solution that I overlooked?

We want to have p2 end at l2_1, but somewhere along the route, it needs to reach l2_4. What if we had used the airplane a2 which is initially at l2_1?

The truck isn't ideal because we still need to drive it from l2_5 to l2_2 and then load the packages. 

Wait, scratch that. The airplane is at the airport, l2_1, and isn't where the packages are. Even if we used the airplane, we'd still need to truck to get the packages to the airport.

Actually, there's an initial state inconsistency (or I'm misinterpreting).

If the initial state is:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_3
- Truck t2 is in location l2_5
- Package p1 is in location l2_2
- Package p2 is in location l2_2
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

And the goal is to get p1 to l2_4 and p2 to l2_1, then the most efficient way would involve using truck t2 to transport both packages, since they are both in city c2. We wouldn't need the airplane or truck t1 which are in city c1.

After more consideration, I'm confident that the plan provided is optimal.

```
drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
```

As I was tracing through this once more, I realized a potential source of confusion in the initial state.
If we interpret:
- Package t1 is in location l1_3
- Package t2 is in location l2_5
- Package p1 is in location l2_2
- Package p2 is in location l2_2
- Package a1 is in location l1_1
- Package a2 is in location l2_1

As: the locations of t1, t2, a1, and a2, then this may be a typo where "Package" was used when "Truck" or "Airplane" was meant. This would make more sense as we already know t1 and t2 are trucks and a1 and a2 are airplanes.

But if it means that there are actually packages named t1, t2, a1, and a2, and trucks named t1 and t2, and airplanes named a1 and a2, then it's confusing. But the list of objects doesn't include packages named t1, t2, a1, and a2, so I'll go with the first interpretation.

With that in mind, the plan is:

```
drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
```

Alright, I'm confident in this plan.
