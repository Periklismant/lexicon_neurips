Alright, so I'm given a logistics planning problem. Let's break it down:

1. We have cities, locations, trucks, airplanes, and packages.
2. Trucks move between locations within a city, and airplanes move between airports.
3. Packages can be carried by trucks and airplanes.
4. We want to move packages to specific locations.

The actions are:
- loadtruck p t l: Load package p in truck t. Both p and t must be at location l.
- loadairplane p ap l: Load package p in airplane ap. Both p and ap must be at location l.
- unloadtruck p t l: Unload package p from truck t at location l.
- unloadairplane p ap l: Unload package p from airplane ap at location l.
- drivetruck t l_from l_to c: Drive truck t from location l_from to location l_to in city c.
- flyairplane ap l_from l_to: Fly airplane ap from location l_from to location l_to.

Now, let's check the initial state of the world:

1. There are two cities, c1 and c2, with 8 locations each.
2. Two trucks, t1 and t2, located at l1_5 and l2_4, respectively.
3. Two airplanes, a1 and a2, located at airports l1_1 and l2_1, respectively.
4. Two packages, p1 and p2, located at l2_8 and l1_2, respectively.

Wait, there seems to be an inconsistency in the initial state. It says "Package t1 is in location l1_5", "Package t2 is in location l2_4", "Package a1 is in location l1_1", "Package a2 is in location l2_1", but t1, t2, a1, and a2 are supposed to be trucks and airplanes, not packages. Let me interpret this as:

- Truck t1 is in location l1_5
- Truck t2 is in location l2_4
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1
- Package p1 is in location l2_8
- Package p2 is in location l1_2

The goal is to bring package p1 to location l1_8 and package p2 to location l2_2.

There are also two constraints:
1. Package p1 must be in location l2_1 at some point.
2. If package p1 is in location l2_1, then at some point after that, it must be in either location l1_5 or location l1_3.

Let's plan out the solution:

For package p1, which is at l2_8:
1. We need to get it to l1_8, but it must also be at l2_1 at some point.
2. After it's at l2_1, it must be at either l1_5 or l1_3 at some point.

For package p2, which is at l1_2:
1. We need to get it to l2_2.

Let's start by planning the movements for package p1:

1. Truck t2 is in location l2_4. We need to drive it to l2_8 to pick up package p1.
2. Load package p1 onto truck t2.
3. Drive truck t2 to airport l2_1 to drop off package p1 (this satisfies the first constraint).
4. Unload package p1 from truck t2 at l2_1.
5. Load package p1 onto airplane a2, which is at l2_1.
6. Fly airplane a2 to airport l1_1.
7. Unload package p1 from airplane a2 at l1_1.
8. Truck t1 is in location l1_5. We need to drive it to l1_1 to pick up package p1.
9. Load package p1 onto truck t1.
10. Drive truck t1 to l1_5 or l1_3 (this satisfies the second constraint).
11. Drive truck t1 to l1_8.
12. Unload package p1 from truck t1 at l1_8.

Now for package p2:

1. Truck t1 is in location l1_5, and we moved it to l1_8 in the plan for package p1. We need to drive it to l1_2 to pick up package p2.
2. Load package p2 onto truck t1.
3. Drive truck t1 to airport l1_1.
4. Unload package p2 from truck t1 at l1_1.
5. Load package p2 onto airplane a1, which is at l1_1.
6. Fly airplane a1 to airport l2_1.
7. Unload package p2 from airplane a1 at l2_1.
8. Truck t2 is in location l2_1 (as per our plan for package p1). We need to load package p2 onto truck t2.
9. Drive truck t2 to l2_2.
10. Unload package p2 from truck t2 at l2_2.

Wait, I realize that the above plans, if combined, start becoming quite complex and not optimal. Let's approach this in a more integrated manner.

First, let's clarify the constraints once more:
1. Package p1 must be in location l2_1 at some point.
2. If package p1 is in location l2_1, then at some point after that, it must be in either location l1_5 or location l1_3.

So, package p1 must pass through l2_1, and then through either l1_5 or l1_3, before it reaches its destination at l1_8.

Here's a more integrated plan:

1. Truck t2 (in l2_4) drives to l2_8 to pick up package p1.
2. Load package p1 onto truck t2.
3. Drive truck t2 to airport l2_1.
4. Unload package p1 from truck t2 at l2_1 (satisfying the first constraint).
5. Load package p1 onto airplane a2.
6. Fly airplane a2 to airport l1_1.
7. Unload package p1 from airplane a2 at l1_1.
8. Truck t1 (in l1_5) drives to l1_1 to pick up package p1.
9. Load package p1 onto truck t1.
10. Drive truck t1 to l1_5 (satisfying the second constraint).
11. Drive truck t1 to l1_8.
12. Unload package p1 from truck t1 at l1_8.

For package p2:
1. Truck t1 was in location l1_8, we need to drive it to l1_2 to pick up package p2.
2. Load package p2 onto truck t1.
3. Drive truck t1 to airport l1_1.
4. Unload package p2 from truck t1 at l1_1.
5. Load package p2 onto airplane a1.
6. Fly airplane a1 to airport l2_1.
7. Unload package p2 from airplane a1 at l2_1.
8. Truck t2 (which was in l2_1) drives to l2_2 (or, if it's already moved elsewhere, we'll need to bring it back to l2_1 and then drive it to l2_2).
9. Load package p2 onto truck t2.
10. Unload package p2 from truck t2 at l2_2.

But there's a potential issue with this. After using truck t2 to bring package p1 to the airport l2_1, the truck might have been driven elsewhere for other operations. This could make our plan for package p2 less efficient. Let's see if we can optimize the plan a bit more.

Also, I notice that we can bring package p2 to l2_2 first, since we'll be using truck t2 which is already in city c2, and that city contains both l2_8 (where p1 is) and l2_2 (where p2 needs to go). This might make the overall plan more efficient.

Let's re-plan:

1. Truck t2 (in l2_4) drives to l2_8 to pick up package p1.
2. Load package p1 onto truck t2.
3. Drive truck t2 to airport l2_1.
4. Unload package p1 from truck t2 at l2_1 (satisfying the first constraint).
5. Drive truck t2 to l2_2 (to drop off package p2 later on).

Now, let's handle package p2, which is at l1_2:
6. Truck t1 (in l1_5) drives to l1_2 to pick up package p2.
7. Load package p2 onto truck t1.
8. Drive truck t1 to airport l1_1.
9. Unload package p2 from truck t1 at l1_1.
10. Load package p2 onto airplane a1.
11. Fly airplane a1 to airport l2_1.
12. Unload package p2 from airplane a1 at l2_1.
13. Load package p2 onto truck t2 (which is at l2_2 or l2_1, depending on our exact plan).
14. Drive truck t2 to l2_2 (if not already there).
15. Unload package p2 from truck t2 at l2_2.

Back to package p1, which is at l2_1:
16. Load package p1 onto airplane a2.
17. Fly airplane a2 to airport l1_1.
18. Unload package p1 from airplane a2 at l1_1.
19. Load package p1 onto truck t1 (assuming truck t1 is still at l1_1).
20. Drive truck t1 to l1_5 (satisfying the second constraint).
21. Drive truck t1 to l1_8.
22. Unload package p1 from truck t1 at l1_8.

There's a slight complication here because of the sequencing. After step 13, there are two possibilities: either truck t2 is at l2_1 (and we need to drive it to l2_2) or truck t2 is already at l2_2 (after step 5). If truck t2 is at l2_2 after step 5, we'd need to drive it back to l2_1 to load package p2 in step 13.

Let's refine this plan to ensure it's optimal:

1. Truck t2 (in l2_4) drives to l2_8 to pick up package p1.
2. Load package p1 onto truck t2.
3. Drive truck t2 to airport l2_1.
4. Unload package p1 from truck t2 at l2_1 (satisfying the first constraint).

For package p2:
5. Truck t1 (in l1_5) drives to l1_2 to pick up package p2.
6. Load package p2 onto truck t1.
7. Drive truck t1 to airport l1_1.
8. Unload package p2 from truck t1 at l1_1.
9. Load package p2 onto airplane a1.
10. Fly airplane a1 to airport l2_1.
11. Unload package p2 from airplane a1 at l2_1.
12. Load package p2 onto truck t2 (which is at l2_1 after step 4).
13. Drive truck t2 to l2_2.
14. Unload package p2 from truck t2 at l2_2.

Back to package p1:
15. Load package p1 onto airplane a2 (which is at l2_1).
16. Fly airplane a2 to airport l1_1.
17. Unload package p1 from airplane a2 at l1_1.
18. Load package p1 onto truck t1 (which is at l1_1 after step 8).
19. Drive truck t1 to l1_5 (satisfying the second constraint).
20. Drive truck t1 to l1_8.
21. Unload package p1 from truck t1 at l1_8.

This looks more streamlined. Let's format the actions according to the problem:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_8 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_8
3. drivetruck t2 l2_8 l2_1 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
5. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_2 c1
6. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
7. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
8. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
9. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
10. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
11. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
12. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
13. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
14. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
15. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
16. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
17. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
18. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
19. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
20. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_8 c1
21. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_8

Hmm, I realized there might be something wrong with the initial state. The description says "Package t1 is in location l1_5", "Package t2 is in location l2_4", etc. If the entity at l1_5 is actually a package, this changes the problem.

Let me review the initial state once more:

"Package t1 is in location l1_5"
"Package t2 is in location l2_4"
"Package p1 is in location l2_8"
"Package p2 is in location l1_2"
"Package a1 is in location l1_1"
"Package a2 is in location l2_1"

Given the list of objects, t1 and t2 are defined as trucks, and a1 and a2 are defined as airplanes. So there seems to be a mistake in the initial state. Let's assume the correct interpretation is:

- Truck t1 is in location l1_5
- Truck t2 is in location l2_4
- Package p1 is in location l2_8
- Package p2 is in location l1_2
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

With this interpretation, the plan provided earlier seems correct. Let's double-check the plan to make sure it's optimal:

1. For package p1, which is at l2_8, we use truck t2 (which is at l2_4) to pick it up and bring it to the airport l2_1. Then it's flown to l1_1, driven to l1_5 to satisfy the constraint, and then to its final destination l1_8.
2. For package p2, which is at l1_2, we use truck t1 (which is at l1_5) to pick it up and bring it to the airport l1_1. Then it's flown to l2_1, and driven to its final destination l2_2.

This plan seems efficient. I think the previous plan with 21 steps is the optimal solution.

Let me trace through the actions to make sure there are no logical inconsistencies:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_8 c2: Truck t2 starts at l2_4 and drives to l2_8 in city c2.
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_8: Package p1 (which is at l2_8) is loaded onto truck t2 (which is now at l2_8).
3. drivetruck t2 l2_8 l2_1 c2: Truck t2, with p1 onboard, drives to l2_1 in city c2.
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1: Package p1 is unloaded from truck t2 at l2_1. (This satisfies the first constraint.)
5. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_2 c1: Truck t1 starts at l1_5 and drives to l1_2 in city c1.
6. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2: Package p2 (which is at l1_2) is loaded onto truck t1 (which is now at l1_2).
7. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1: Truck t1, with p2 onboard, drives to l1_1 in city c1.
8. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1: Package p2 is unloaded from truck t1 at l1_1.
9. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1: Package p2 is loaded onto airplane a1 (which is at l1_1).
10. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1: Airplane a1, with p2 onboard, flies to l2_1.
11. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1: Package p2 is unloaded from airplane a1 at l2_1.
12. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1: Package p2 is loaded onto truck t2 (which is at l2_1).
13. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2: Truck t2, with p2 onboard, drives to l2_2 in city c2.
14. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2: Package p2 is unloaded from truck t2 at l2_2. (Package p2 goal is achieved.)
15. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1: Package p1 (which is at l2_1) is loaded onto airplane a2 (which is at l2_1).
16. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1: Airplane a2, with p1 onboard, flies to l1_1.
17. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1: Package p1 is unloaded from airplane a2 at l1_1.
18. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1: Package p1 is loaded onto truck t1 (which is at l1_1).
19. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1: Truck t1, with p1 onboard, drives to l1_5 in city c1. (This satisfies the second constraint, which says that after p1 is at l2_1, it must be at l1_5 or l1_3.)
20. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_8 c1: Truck t1, with p1 onboard, drives to l1_8 in city c1.
21. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_8: Package p1 is unloaded from truck t1 at l1_8. (Package p1 goal is achieved.)

Wait, there's a mistake in the action unloadairplane in step 17. It should be "unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1", not "loadairplane p1 ap l1_1". Let me fix that.

Corrected plan:
1. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_8 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_8
3. drivetruck t2 l2_8 l2_1 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
5. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_2 c1
6. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
7. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
8. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
9. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
10. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
11. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
12. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
13. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
14. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
15. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
16. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
17. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
18. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
19. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
20. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_8 c1
21. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_8

This corrected plan looks good to me. It ensures the packages end up in their desired locations and satisfies the given constraints. Since the logic is consistent, I believe this is the optimal plan.

I should double-check the constraints again:
1. Package p1 must be in location l2_1 at some point. This is achieved in step 4.
2. If package p1 is in location l2_1, then at some point after that, it must be in either location l1_5 or location l1_3. This is achieved in step 19, where p1 is in l1_5 after having been at l2_1.

The goal is to have package p1 at location l1_8 and package p2 at location l2_2, which is achieved in steps 21 and 14, respectively. All the logic seems consistent, so I'm satisfied with this plan.

Actually, I just realized there might be an error in how I interpreted the constraints. Let me check again:

"The following expression must hold in at least one state: "Package p1 is in location l2_1"" - This is clear, and my plan includes p1 at l2_1 at step 4.

"If expression "Package p1 is in location l2_1" holds in some state s, then expression "At least one of the following conditions is true: "Package p1 is in location l1_5", "Package p1 is in location l1_3"" must hold at s or at some state after s" - This means that after p1 is at l2_1, it must be at either l1_5 or l1_3 at some point, and my plan has p1 at l1_5 in step 19, after it has been at l2_1. So this constraint is met.

Yes, I've double-checked my interpretation of the constraints, and I believe the plan I've given is accurate and optimal.

Let me also check one more edge case: if we're looking for the optimal plan in terms of the number of steps, would it be faster to have pacakge p1 pass through location l1_3 rather than l1_5? Let's see:

Consider an alternative sequence after step 18:
19'. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
20'. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_8 c1
21'. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_8

In this alternative, we'd drive directly from l1_1 to l1_3, and then from l1_3 to l1_8. But we need to check the relative distances: is l1_1 -> l1_3 -> l1_8 shorter than l1_1 -> l1_5 -> l1_8?

Based on the problem description, it seems that all locations within a city are adjacent, and any location can be reached from any other location directly. There's no indicated difference in travel cost. So the answer comes down to the number of steps, and both alternatives have the same number of steps (2 extra drive steps).

Given that both routes are equally efficient in terms of steps, I'll stick with the one going through l1_5, but going through l1_3 would be just as optimal. The final plan I provided earlier is therefore an optimal solution.

Wait, looking at my plan again, there's a mistake in the loadairplane and unloadairplane actions. They should be "loadairplane p ap l" and "unloadairplane p ap l" respectively. I've been writing some of these incorrectly in the plan. Let me fix those:

Corrected plan:
1. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_8 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_8
3. drivetruck t2 l2_8 l2_1 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
5. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_2 c1
6. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
7. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
8. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
9. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
10. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
11. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
12. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
13. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
14. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
15. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
16. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
17. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
18. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
19. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
20. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_8 c1
21. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_8

Actually, I notice another issue: the original problem description gave the following for the "loadairplane" and "unloadairplane" actions:

"loadairplane p ap l": Load package p in airplane ap. Both p and ap are in location l.
"loadairplane p ap l": Unload package p from airplane ap in location l.

There's a mistake in the problem statement. It's giving the same name for different actions. The second one should be "unloadairplane p ap l". Let's make sure my actions are correct according to what was likely intended:

9. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
11. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
15. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
17. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

These seem correct now. The rest of the plan remains the same. I've double-checked all the actions to ensure they follow the rules of the domain. With these corrections, I'm confident that the plan is optimal.

Now, let me check once more for logical consistency:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_8 c2: Truck t2 starts at l2_4 and drives to l2_8 in city c2.
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_8: Package p1 (which is at l2_8) is loaded onto truck t2 (which is now at l2_8).
3. drivetruck t2 l2_8 l2_1 c2: Truck t2, with p1 onboard, drives to l2_1 in city c2.
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1: Package p1 is unloaded from truck t2 at l2_1. (This satisfies the first constraint.)
5. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_2 c1: Truck t1 starts at l1_5 and drives to l1_2 in city c1.
6. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2: Package p2 (which is at l1_2) is loaded onto truck t1 (which is now at l1_2).
7. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1: Truck t1, with p2 onboard, drives to l1_1 in city c1.
8. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1: Package p2 is unloaded from truck t1 at l1_1.
9. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1: Package p2 is loaded onto airplane a1 (which is at l1_1).
10. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1: Airplane a1, with p2 onboard, flies to l2_1.
11. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1: Package p2 is unloaded from airplane a1 at l2_1.
12. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1: Package p2 is loaded onto truck t2 (which is at l2_1).
13. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2: Truck t2, with p2 onboard, drives to l2_2 in city c2.
14. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2: Package p2 is unloaded from truck t2 at l2_2. (Package p2 goal is achieved.)
15. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1: Package p1 (which is at l2_1) is loaded onto airplane a2 (which is at l2_1).
16. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1: Airplane a2, with p1 onboard, flies to l1_1.
17. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1: Package p1 is unloaded from airplane a2 at l1_1.
18. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1: Package p1 is loaded onto truck t1 (which is at l1_1).
19. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1: Truck t1, with p1 onboard, drives to l1_5 in city c1. (This satisfies the second constraint, which says that after p1 is at l2_1, it must be at l1_5 or l1_3.)
20. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_8 c1: Truck t1, with p1 onboard, drives to l1_8 in city c1.
21. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_8: Package p1 is unloaded from truck t1 at l1_8. (Package p1 goal is achieved.)

Everything looks logically consistent. Given the initial state, the goal, and the constraints, this plan is optimal. I'm satisfied with the result.
