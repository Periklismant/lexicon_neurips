The provided plan efficiently transports both packages while satisfying all constraints. For **p1**, it uses truck t2 and airplane a2 to move from c2 to c1, ensuring it passes through l2_1 (satisfying the first constraint) and then routes through l1_5 (satisfying the second constraint). For **p2**, it uses truck t1 and airplane a1 to move from c1 to c2, delivering to l2_2. The sequence minimizes steps by interleaving actions where possible and ensuring all preconditions are met.
