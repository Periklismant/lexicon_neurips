1. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_8 c2: Truck t2 starts at l2_4 and drives to l2_8 in city c2.
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_8: Package p1 (which is at l2_8) is loaded onto truck t2 (which is now at l2_8).
3. drivetruck t2 l2_8 l2_1 c2: Truck t2, with p1 onboard, drives to l2_1 in city c2.
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1: Package p1 is unloaded from truck t2 at l2_1. (This satisfies the first constraint.)
5. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_2 c1: Truck t1 starts at l1_5 and drives to l1_2 in city c1.
6. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2: Package p2 (which is at l1_2) is loaded onto truck t1 (which is now at l1_2).
7. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1: Truck t1, with p2 onboard, drives to l1_1 in city c1.
8. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1: Package p2 is unloaded from truck t1 at l1_1.
9. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1: Package p2 is loaded onto airplane a1 (which is at l1_1).
10. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1: Airplane a1, with p2 onboard, flies to l2_1.
11. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1: Package p2 is unloaded from airplane a1 at l2_1.
12. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1: Package p2 is loaded onto truck t2 (which is at l2_1).
13. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2: Truck t2, with p2 onboard, drives to l2_2 in city c2.
14. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2: Package p2 is unloaded from truck t2 at l2_2. (Package p2 goal is achieved.)
15. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1: Package p1 (which is at l2_1) is loaded onto airplane a2 (which is at l2_1).
16. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1: Airplane a2, with p1 onboard, flies to l1_1.
17. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1: Package p1 is unloaded from airplane a2 at l1_1.
18. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1: Package p1 is loaded onto truck t1 (which is at l1_1).
19. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1: Truck t1, with p1 onboard, drives to l1_5 in city c1. (This satisfies the second constraint, which says that after p1 is at l2_1, it must be at l1_5 or l1_3.)
20. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_8 c1: Truck t1, with p1 onboard, drives to l1_8 in city c1.
21. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_8: Package p1 is unloaded from truck t1 at l1_8. (Package p1 goal is achieved.)
