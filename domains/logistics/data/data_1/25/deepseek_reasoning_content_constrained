Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. Hmm, the goal is to get p1 to l1_5 and p2 to l2_3. The constraints are a bit tricky. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the initial state: p1 and p2 are both in l2_5. The trucks t1 is in l1_5 (wait, no, the original state says "Package t1 is in location l1_5"â€”wait, that's a typo. Wait, the original state lists "Package t1 is in location l1_5", but t1 is a truck. Oh, right, the user might have made a mistake here. Because trucks are objects, so their locations should be part of the state. So probably, "Truck t1 is in location l1_5", and similarly for t2. Let me check the original state again. The user wrote:

Original state includes:
"Package t1 is in location l1_5"
"Package t2 is in location l2_3"
"Package p1 is in location l2_5"
"Package p2 is in location l2_5"
"Package a1 is in location l1_1"
"Package a2 is in location l2_1"

Wait, that can't be right. Because t1 and t2 are trucks, not packages. Similarly, a1 and a2 are airplanes. So this must be a mistake in the problem statement. The user probably meant:

"Truck t1 is in location l1_5"
"Truck t2 is in location l2_3"
"Airplane a1 is in location l1_1"
"Airplane a2 is in location l2_1"

Otherwise, the problem doesn't make sense. For example, you can't load a package into a truck that's a package. So I need to assume that the original state has typos and that t1, t2, a1, a2 are trucks and airplanes located in those locations. Otherwise, the problem is impossible. Let's proceed with that assumption.

So initial locations:

- Trucks: t1 at l1_5 (city c1), t2 at l2_3 (city c2).
- Airplanes: a1 at l1_1 (c1's airport), a2 at l2_1 (c2's airport).
- Packages: p1 and p2 at l2_5 (city c2), which is in c2.

The goal is to get p1 to l1_5 (c1) and p2 to l2_3 (c2). So p2 needs to move within c2 from l2_5 to l2_3. But l2_5 is in c2. Let's see the cities' locations:

For c1: locations l1_1 (airport), l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5.

For c2: l2_1 (airport), l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5.

So p1 is starting in l2_5 (c2) and needs to go to l1_5 (c1). That likely requires moving it from c2 to c1 via airplane. Since airplanes can only move between airports, so we need to get p1 from l2_5 to l2_1 (airport) via truck, then fly to l1_1 (c1's airport), then drive to l1_5 via truck.

But p2 is already in l2_5, needs to go to l2_3. Since l2_5 is in c2, and t2 is in l2_3 (assuming the corrected state), so perhaps use t2 to move p2. Wait, no: if p2 is in l2_5, and t2 is in l2_3, then first, the truck needs to drive to l2_5, load p2, then drive back to l2_3 and unload it.

But wait, in the initial state, if t2 is in l2_3 (as per the corrected state), then to get p2 from l2_5 to l2_3, we need to drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_5 (but that's in the same city c2). Then load p2 into t2, drive back to l2_3, unload. That's possible.

So for p2: drivetruck t2 from l2_3 to l2_5 (c2), load p2 into t2, drive back to l2_3, unload. But wait, the initial location of p2 is l2_5. So:

1. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_5 (c2).
2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5.
3. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_3.
4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3.

That would handle p2. But let's check if that's possible. The truck t2 is in l2_3 initially. So step 1 is allowed. After driving to l2_5, the truck is there. Then load p2 (which is at l2_5) into t2. Then drive back to l2_3 and unload. That works.

For p1: need to get from l2_5 (c2) to l1_5 (c1). So possible steps:

- Use a truck in c2 to move p1 to the airport l2_1 (since airplanes can only fly between airports). But the truck in c2 is t2, which is initially in l2_3. Wait, but if t2 is being used for p2, maybe we need to use another truck? Wait, in the problem statement, the trucks are t1 and t2. t1 is in c1 (l1_5), and t2 is in c2 (l2_3). So to move p1 from l2_5 (c2) to l2_1 (c2's airport), we need a truck in c2. t2 is in c2. But if t2 is already being used for p2, maybe we can sequence the actions.

But perhaps the steps can be interleaved. Let's think. For p1:

1. Use t2 to drive to l2_5, load p1 into t2, drive to l2_1 (airport), unload p1. Then fly it to l1_1 (c1's airport) using a1 or a2. Wait, a2 is at l2_1 (c2's airport). So load p1 into a2, fly to l1_1. Then use t1 (which is in l1_5, c1) to drive to l1_1, load p1, drive back to l1_5, unload.

Wait, but t1 is in l1_5. So to get t1 to l1_1 (airport), we need to drive it through c1's locations. From l1_5 to l1_4, l1_3, etc., but depending on the connectivity. Wait, the cities have locations l1_1 to l1_5. How are they connected? The problem states that trucks can move between locations in their city. But the exact connections aren't given. However, the drivetruck action allows moving between any two locations in the same city, as per the preconditions: "l_from and l_to are locations of c". So the truck can go directly from any location to any other in the same city. So, for example, t1 can drive from l1_5 to l1_1 directly.

So for p1's plan:

- In c2: t2 drives to l2_5 (if not already there for p2), load p1, drive to l2_1 (airport), unload. Then load into airplane a2 (which is at l2_1), fly to l1_1. Then in c1, t1 drives from l1_5 to l1_1 (airport), load p1, drive back to l1_5, unload.

But how to manage the constraints?

The constraints are:

1. At least once, p1 must be in l2_5. Well, initially, p1 is in l2_5. So that's already satisfied. Wait, the original state says p1 is in l2_5. So the first constraint is automatically met because the initial state already has p1 in l2_5. So the constraint is that in at least one state (which is the initial state), p1 is in l2_5. Therefore, that's already satisfied, so no need to worry about that.

But wait, the problem's constraints state: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'Package p1 is in location l2_5'". Since the initial state has p1 in l2_5, that's satisfied. However, the second constraint is a conditional: if p1 is in l2_5 in some state s, then in s or a subsequent state, at least one of "p1 is in l2_4" or "p2 is in l2_2" must hold.

Wait, the constraint says: If in some state s, p1 is in l2_5, then either in s or in a later state, p1 is in l2_4 or p2 is in l2_2. Since the initial state is s0 where p1 is in l2_5, then the requirement is that either in s0 or after, p1 is in l2_4 or p2 is in l2_2. But in s0, p1 is in l2_5 and p2 is in l2_5, so neither p1 in l2_4 nor p2 in l2_2 holds. Therefore, after s0, we need to have at some point p1 in l2_4 or p2 in l2_2.

But in our plan, after s0, we might move p1 from l2_5 to l2_1 (via truck), so p1 would leave l2_5. So the constraint is satisfied because in the initial state, the condition is already met (p1 in l2_5), and after that, as long as either p1 moves to l2_4 or p2 moves to l2_2. But how?

Wait, the constraint is that if in any state s, p1 is in l2_5, then in s or a subsequent state, either p1 is in l2_4 or p2 is in l2_2. So even though the initial state has p1 in l2_5, we must ensure that at some point after that, either p1 is in l2_4 or p2 is in l2_2. Since the initial state is the first state, and the condition must hold for any state where p1 is in l2_5. But since the initial state is the only state where p1 is in l2_5 (assuming we move it out in the first steps), then we need to ensure that after the initial state, either p1 goes to l2_4 or p2 goes to l2_2.

Wait, but once p1 is moved from l2_5, it's no longer there. So the only state where p1 is in l2_5 is s0. Therefore, the constraint requires that in s0 or after, either p1 is in l2_4 or p2 is in l2_2. Since in s0, neither is true, we need to make sure that in some subsequent state, one of those holds.

So how can we satisfy this? Let's see. For example, when moving p1 from l2_5 to l2_1 via truck, maybe we have to drive through l2_4. But trucks can go directly between any locations in the same city. So if we drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 directly, then p1 would be in the truck during transit, but the intermediate locations aren't part of the state. The only locations that matter are where the truck is after each action. So if the truck moves from l2_5 to l2_1 directly, then p1 is in the truck, and the truck's location changes from l2_5 to l2_1. So in that case, p1 is never in l2_4. So that doesn't help.

Alternatively, if we have to make p2 go to l2_2. For example, after moving p2 from l2_5 to l2_3 via t2, perhaps we can have a step where p2 is moved to l2_2. But the goal requires p2 to be in l2_3. So that's conflicting. Wait, the goal is for p2 to be in l2_3. So if we have to move p2 to l2_2 at some point, then we have to move it back. But that's adding unnecessary steps. However, the constraints require that if p1 is in l2_5 (which is only in s0), then after s0, either p1 is in l2_4 or p2 is in l2_2. So how can we satisfy this?

Option 1: Move p2 to l2_2 temporarily. For example, after loading p2 into t2 at l2_5, drive t2 to l2_2, unload p2 there (satisfying the constraint), then load it again and drive to l2_3. But that adds steps. However, the plan must be optimal (shortest possible). So this would make the plan longer. But maybe there's another way.

Option 2: When moving p1 from l2_5 to l2_1, make a stop at l2_4. But again, the truck can move directly, so unless we have to, but the problem states that the drivetruck action can go directly from any location to another in the same city. So moving from l2_5 to l2_4, unload p1 (but why?), which would put p1 in l2_4, satisfying the constraint, then drive to l2_1. But that's two more steps (drive to l2_4, unload, then drive to l2_1, load again). But that would make the plan longer. Since we need an optimal plan, this may not be acceptable.

Alternatively, maybe when handling p2, we can move it to l2_2 first, then to l2_3. For example, drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_2, load p2 (but p2 is in l2_5, so that doesn't help). Wait, no. p2 is in l2_5 initially. So to get it to l2_2, we need to drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_5, load p2, then drive to l2_2, unload (which would satisfy the constraint), then drive to l2_3 and unload again. But that's adding steps. The goal is to have p2 in l2_3. So this approach would result in:

For p2:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2
2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
3. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (this satisfies the constraint)
5. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
6. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
7. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
8. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3

But steps 5,6,7,8 are redundant. This would make the plan longer. So this is not optimal. The optimal plan for p2 is to drive from l2_3 to l2_5, load, drive back to l2_3, unload. That's 4 steps. But if we have to go through l2_2, it's 8 steps, which is worse.

Hmm. So how else can we satisfy the constraint? Let's think again. The constraint says that if in any state s, p1 is in l2_5, then in s or a later state, p1 is in l2_4 or p2 is in l2_2. Since the initial state s0 has p1 in l2_5, we need to ensure that in s0 or after, one of those holds. In s0, neither is true. So we need to make sure that in some state after s0, either p1 is in l2_4 or p2 is in l2_2.

But how? If we move p1 out of l2_5, like loading it into a truck and driving to l2_1, then p1 is no longer in l2_5. So the only state where p1 is in l2_5 is s0. Therefore, the constraint is that after s0, either p1 is in l2_4 or p2 is in l2_2. So during the plan execution, after the initial state, at some point, one of those must be true.

So maybe when moving p1 from l2_5 to l2_1, the truck could pass through l2_4? But as per the problem's actions, when you drive a truck from l_from to l_to, it's a direct move. So the truck is in l_from before the action and in l_to after. There's no intermediate location. So if we drive from l2_5 to l2_1, p1 is in the truck during the move, but the only location changes are from l2_5 to l2_1. So p1 is never in l2_4.

Therefore, to satisfy the constraint, we need to have p2 in l2_2 at some point. How? Maybe when moving p2 from l2_5 to l2_3, we can make a detour via l2_2. But that would add steps, making the plan longer. But the problem requires the plan to be optimal (shortest possible). So this would not be optimal.

Wait, maybe there's another way. Let's see:

The initial state has p1 in l2_5. The constraint is that whenever p1 is in l2_5 (which is only in the initial state), then in that state or a later state, p1 is in l2_4 or p2 is in l2_2. Since in the initial state, neither is true, we must have in some later state either p1 in l2_4 or p2 in l2_2.

So how can we achieve that without adding extra steps?

For p1's journey: to get from l2_5 (c2) to l1_5 (c1), we need to:

1. Load p1 into a truck in c2 (t2), drive to airport l2_1, unload p1.
2. Load p1 into airplane a2, fly to l1_1 (c1's airport).
3. Load p1 into truck t1 (which is in l1_5, so need to drive t1 to l1_1 first), then drive back to l1_5 and unload.

So steps for p1:

- For step 1: Use t2 to move p1 from l2_5 to l2_1.

But t2 is in l2_3 initially. So first, drive t2 to l2_5:

Action: drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2

Then load p1 into t2:

Action: loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

Then drive t2 to l2_1:

Action: drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2

Unload p1 at l2_1:

Action: unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

Now p1 is at l2_1. Then load it into airplane a2 (which is at l2_1):

Action: loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

Fly a2 to l1_1:

Action: flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

Now p1 is in a2 at l1_1. Unload:

Action: unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

Now, to get p1 to l1_5, we need t1, which is in l1_5. So drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_1:

Action: drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1

Load p1 into t1:

Action: loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

Drive back to l1_5:

Action: drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1

Unload:

Action: unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5

That's the path for p1.

For p2:

We need to get it from l2_5 to l2_3. t2 is initially at l2_3, but after being used for p1's transport, it's at l2_1. Wait, no: after using t2 to move p1, t2 is at l2_1. So after handling p1, t2 is at l2_1, but p2 is still at l2_5. So to move p2, we need to use t2 again. But after moving p1, t2 is at l2_1. So to move p2, we need to:

1. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_5 (c2)
2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
3. Drive to l2_3
4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3

But this would add steps after handling p1.

But wait, the order of actions matters. Maybe we can interleave the steps for p1 and p2 to optimize.

Wait, let's outline all steps:

For p1:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
3. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
5. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
6. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
7. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
8. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
9. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
10. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
11. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5

For p2:

12. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
13. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
14. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_3 c2
15. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3

But this plan has 15 steps. But maybe some steps can be reordered.

But also, the constraints require that after the initial state (s0), there's a state where p1 is in l2_4 or p2 is in l2_2. In the current plan, after s0, the first actions involve moving t2 to l2_5 (step 1), then loading p1 (step2), driving to l2_1 (step3). So after step3, p1 is unloaded at l2_1. So during these steps, p2 is still in l2_5. So none of the steps so far put p2 in l2_2 or p1 in l2_4. Therefore, the constraint is not met.

So we need to adjust the plan to ensure that after the initial state, either p1 is in l2_4 or p2 is in l2_2. Let's see.

Option: After moving p1 to l2_1, but before moving p2, perhaps move p2 to l2_2. But how? Because t2 is at l2_1 after step3. So to move p2 from l2_5 to l2_2, we need t2 to be at l2_5. But after step3, t2 is at l2_1.

Wait, perhaps during the process of moving p1, we can have a step where p2 is moved to l2_2. But how? Let's think differently.

Alternative approach: First, move p2 to l2_2 to satisfy the constraint, then move it to l2_3. But that adds steps. For example:

For p2:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2
2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (wait, no: p2 is in l2_5. So that won't work.)

Alternatively, after moving t2 to l2_5 for p1, before loading p1, load p2 into t2 and drive to l2_2. But this complicates things.

Wait, here's an idea:

After step1 (t2 is at l2_5), before step2 (loading p1), we can load p2 into t2, drive to l2_2, unload p2 there (satisfying the constraint), then drive back to l2_5 to pick up p1. But that would add steps.

But the steps would be:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2
2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
3. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (now p2 is in l2_2, satisfying the constraint)
5. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
6. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (now p1 is loaded)
7. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
8. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
... then continue as before for p1.

Then, after that, we need to move p2 from l2_2 to l2_3:

9. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2 (but after step8, t2 is at l2_1)
10. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
11. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
12. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3

But this adds a lot of steps (total steps would be 12 for p1 and p2 combined). But the original plan without the constraint handling was 15 steps. With this approach, it's more steps. But the problem requires an optimal plan, which is as short as possible. So this approach may not be optimal.

Alternative idea: Find a way to satisfy the constraint by moving p2 to l2_2 as part of the necessary steps. For example, when moving p2 from l2_5 to l2_3, take a detour via l2_2. But again, that adds steps.

Wait, the constraint requires that if p1 is in l2_5 (which is only in s0), then after s0, either p1 is in l2_4 or p2 is in l2_2. So we need to have at least one state after s0 where p2 is in l2_2 or p1 is in l2_4.

But in the original plan (without handling the constraint), p2 is moved from l2_5 to l2_3, but that requires driving through l2_5 to l2_3, so p2 is in l2_3. So no step in that plan has p2 in l2_2 or p1 in l2_4. Therefore, the original plan would violate the constraint.

Thus, we must modify the plan to include a state where p2 is in l2_2 or p1 in l2_4.

The optimal way would be to have p2 pass through l2_2 during its movement. But how?

Wait, perhaps we can adjust the order. For example:

First, handle p2 by moving it to l2_2, then to l2_3. But that requires:

For p2:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2
2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
3. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (now constraint is satisfied)
5. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
6. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3

But steps 5 and 6: after step4, p2 is in l2_2. To get it to l2_3, we need to load it again. So:

5. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
6. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
7. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3

So for p2, that's 7 steps. But in the original plan without the constraint, p2's steps were 4. So this adds 3 steps, making the plan longer. Not optimal.

Alternative: Maybe during the movement of p1, we can have p1 pass through l2_4. For example, after loading p1 into t2, drive to l2_4, unload (satisfying constraint), then drive to l2_1. But again, this adds steps:

For p1:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
3. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (constraint satisfied)
5. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
6. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
7. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
... then continue as before.

But steps 3-7 are added, making the plan longer. Not optimal.

Hmm. So how can we satisfy the constraint without adding steps? Let's think differently.

Wait, maybe when moving p1 from l2_5 to l2_1, we can split the drive into two steps: l2_5 to l2_4, then l2_4 to l2_1. But that's two drive actions instead of one. So:

For p1:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2 (t2 is now at l2_5)
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
3. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2 (p1 is in t2 at l2_4)
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (now p1 is in l2_4, satisfying the constraint)
5. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
6. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
7. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
...

But this adds steps 3-6 compared to the original plan. So again, not optimal.

Wait, maybe the key is to realize that the constraint requires that if p1 is in l2_5 in any state, then in that state or later, one of the conditions holds. Since the initial state is the only state where p1 is in l2_5, we need to have after s0, at least one of the conditions holds. But in the original plan (without any detours), after moving p1 out of l2_5, the next state has p1 in t2 at l2_5 (during step2), but after that, it's moved to l2_1. So during step2, p1 is loaded into t2, which is at l2_5. So p1 is no longer in l2_5 but in t2. So the only state where p1 is in l2_5 is s0. Therefore, the constraint is that after s0, one of the conditions must hold. So in the plan, after s0, at some point, either p1 is in l2_4 or p2 is in l2_2.

But in the original plan, neither happens. So the plan would be invalid.

Therefore, we need to adjust the plan to include one of those.

Let's think of a way to have p2 in l2_2 during the plan. For example, when moving p2 from l2_5 to l2_3, maybe we can first move it to l2_2, then to l2_3. But how?

But initially, p2 is in l2_5. So to move it to l2_3 via l2_2:

1. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_5.
2. Load p2 into t2.
3. Drive t2 to l2_2.
4. Unload p2 (now in l2_2, satisfying the constraint).
5. Load p2 again.
6. Drive to l2_3.
7. Unload.

But that's two extra steps (steps 3-7). Not optimal.

Alternatively, maybe use another truck? But there's only t1 and t2. t1 is in c1, so can't help in c2.

Hmm. Maybe we can use the airplane a2 to move p2 to l2_2? But airplanes can only fly between airports. l2_2 is not an airport. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps use the airplane to move p2 to another city and back, but that seems even more steps.

Wait, but the constraint doesn't require p2 to stay in l2_2, just that at some point it is there. So maybe after delivering p1, we can move p2 to l2_2 and then to l2_3. But that adds steps.

Alternatively, can we find a way to have p2 in l2_2 during the process of moving p1?

Wait, here's an idea: After step1 (t2 is at l2_5), load both p1 and p2 into t2. But wait, can a truck carry multiple packages? The problem doesn't say anything about capacity, so I assume trucks can carry multiple packages. So after loading p1 and p2 into t2, drive to l2_2, unload p2, then drive to l2_1 and unload p1. That way, p2 is in l2_2, satisfying the constraint.

But let's outline this:

For p1 and p2:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
3. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
4. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
5. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (constraint satisfied)
6. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
7. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
...

Then proceed with flying p1 to c1.

For p2, after step5, it's in l2_2. Then we need to get it to l2_3:

8. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2 (but after step6, t2 is at l2_1)
9. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
10. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
11. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3

But this adds steps 8-11. So the total steps for p1 and p2 would be more, but perhaps this is the only way to satisfy the constraint.

But is this optimal? Let's count the steps:

For p1:

1. drive t2 to l2_5
2. load p1
3. load p2
4. drive to l2_2
5. unload p2
6. drive to l2_1
7. unload p1
8. load into airplane, fly, unload, drive t1 to airport, load, drive back, unload.

For p1, steps 1-7, then steps for airplane and t1.

For p2:

Steps 1-5 to get to l2_2, then steps 8-11 to get to l2_3.

Total steps for p2: steps 1-5, then 8-11 (which is 8 steps). For p1: steps 1-7, then steps 8 (loadairplane), 9 (fly), 10 (unload), 11 (drive t1 to l1_1), 12 (load), 13 (drive to l1_5), 14 (unload). So total steps would be 14 for p1 and 8 for p2, but some steps overlap. For example, step1 is shared. So total steps would be around 20, which is longer than the original plan. So not optimal.

Hmm. There must be a better way. Let's think again. The constraint is that after s0 (which has p1 in l2_5), there must be a state where either p1 is in l2_4 or p2 is in l2_2. How can we achieve this with minimal steps?

Wait, after loading p1 into t2 and driving to l2_1, perhaps during that drive, the truck passes through l2_4? But as per the problem's actions, you can drive directly between any locations. So if we drive from l2_5 to l2_4, then to l2_1, that would require two drive actions, and p1 would be in l2_4 after the first drive. So:

For p1:

1. drive t2 to l2_5
2. load p1
3. drive t2 to l2_4
4. unload p1 (now in l2_4, satisfying the constraint)
5. load p1 again
6. drive to l2_1
7. unload
...

This adds steps 3-6, which is four steps instead of one. Not optimal.

Alternatively, maybe when moving p2, we can make a stop at l2_2. But p2 starts in l2_5. So:

For p2:

1. drive t2 to l2_5
2. load p2
3. drive to l2_2
4. unload (satisfies constraint)
5. load again
6. drive to l2_3
7. unload

This adds steps 3-7 compared to the original 4 steps. So three extra steps.

But how to combine this with p1's steps.

Wait, perhaps interleave the steps. For example:

First, move t2 to l2_5, load both p1 and p2, drive to l2_2, unload p2 (satisfy constraint), then drive to l2_1 to unload p1. Then, for p2, drive back to l2_2, load, drive to l2_3, unload. But this would require:

Steps:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
3. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
4. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
5. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
6. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
7. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
8. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
9. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
10. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
11. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
12. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
13. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
14. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
15. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
16. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
17. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
18. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3

This plan has 18 steps. But the original plan without constraint handling was 15 steps. So this is longer. Is there a way to make it shorter?

Alternatively, after step5 (unloading p2 at l2_2), maybe use another truck to move p2 to l2_3. But there's no other truck in c2. Only t2 is there.

Hmm. This is getting complicated. Let's think again.

Wait, the constraint requires that if p1 is in l2_5 (which is only in s0), then after s0, either p1 is in l2_4 or p2 is in l2_2. So the simplest way to satisfy this is to have p2 moved to l2_2 at some point after s0, even if just temporarily.

But how to do that with minimal steps.

Maybe we can have t2 move p2 to l2_2 first, then to l2_3, but that would require:

For p2:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2
2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (but p2 is in l2_5, so can't load there. So this is not possible.)

Alternatively, after moving p1 to l2_1, use t2 to move p2 from l2_5 to l2_2, then to l2_3. But t2 is at l2_1 after moving p1. So:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
3. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
5. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
6. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3

This adds steps 1-6 after moving p1. But this requires steps 1-6 for p2, which is 6 steps. Original plan for p2 was 4 steps. So this is longer.

But the constraint must be satisfied. So there's no way around it.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the airplane a2 to carry p2 to l2_2? But airplanes can only land at airports, and l2_2 is not an airport. So that's not possible.

Hmm. This seems like a dead end. Is there a way I'm missing?

Wait, maybe the constraint can be satisfied by moving p1 to l2_4. For example:

After loading p1 into t2 at l2_5, drive to l2_4, unload (satisfy constraint), then load again and drive to l2_1.

But this adds steps:

For p1:

1. drive t2 to l2_5
2. load p1
3. drive to l2_4
4. unload p1
5. load p1
6. drive to l2_1
7. unload
...

This adds steps 3-6 (4 steps) instead of just driving directly from l2_5 to l2_1. So that's four extra steps. Not optimal.

But this satisfies the constraint by having p1 in l2_4.

So overall steps would be:

For p1:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
3. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
5. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
6. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
7. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
8. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
9. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
10. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
11. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
12. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
13. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
14. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5

For p2:

15. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2 (after step7, t2 is at l2_1)
16. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
17. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_3 c2
18. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3

Total steps: 18.

This plan satisfies the constraint because in step4, p1 is in l2_4. Thus, after s0, there's a state where p1 is in l2_4, satisfying the constraint. However, this adds four extra steps compared to the original plan. But perhaps there's a shorter way.

Wait, what if instead of moving p1 to l2_4, we move p2 to l2_2 while handling p1's movement?

For example, after loading both p1 and p2 into t2 at l2_5, drive to l2_2, unload p2, then drive to l2_1 to unload p1. Then drive back to l2_2 to load p2 and take it to l2_3.

But that would be:

Steps:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
3. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
4. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
5. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (constraint satisfied)
6. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
7. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
8. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
9. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
10. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
11. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
12. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
13. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
14. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
15. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
16. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
17. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
18. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3

Again, 18 steps. But perhaps this is the minimal possible.

But is there a way to reduce steps? For instance, after step5 (p2 in l2_2), can we load p2 into t2 again and drive directly to l2_3 from l2_2? But after step5, t2 is at l2_2, and p2 is unloaded there. So step6 would be driving to l2_1 with p1. Then after that, t2 is at l2_1, and we have to drive back to l2_2 to get p2. This adds steps.

Alternatively, after step5 (p2 in l2_2), can we load p2 into t2 and drive to l2_3 in the same steps? But after step5, t2 is at l2_2, and p2 is there. So:

After step5:

6. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
7. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
8. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3

But this is part of p2's steps. But then steps for p1 would continue from step6 (drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2) with p1 in t2. But if p2 is loaded in step6, then t2 is carrying both p1 and p2. When you unload p1 at l2_1 (step7), p2 is still in t2. Then you can drive t2 back to l2_3 to unload p2. But how?

Let me outline this:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
3. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
4. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
5. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (p2 is in l2_2, constraint satisfied)
6. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
7. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
8. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
9. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (now p2 is in l2_1)
10. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
11. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
12. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
13. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
14. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
15. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
16. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
17. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
18. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (but p2 is in l2_1, not in l2_3. This doesn't work.)

Ah, this approach is flawed. After step9, p2 is unloaded at l2_1. So to get it to l2_3, we need to load it into a truck at l2_1 and drive to l2_3. But t2 is at l2_1 after step7. So steps would be:

17. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
18. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
19. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3

This adds even more steps. So this approach is not efficient.

At this point, it seems like the minimal plan that satisfies the constraints requires 18 steps. But I'm not sure if there's a more optimal way. Let's try to find another approach.

Wait, maybe we can use the airplane a2 to move p1, but in a way that satisfies the constraint. For example, after loading p1 into a2 at l2_1, fly to l2_4's airport? Wait, l2_4 is not an airport. Airplanes can only fly to airports. The airports are l1_1 and l2_1. So no, that's not possible.

Another idea: Maybe the constraint can be satisfied by having p1 in l2_4 during its journey. For example, when moving p1 from l2_5 to l2_1, we have to drive through l2_4. But as per the problem's actions, trucks can move directly between any locations. So if we drive from l2_5 to l2_4, then to l2_1, this would require two actions, and p1 would be in l2_4 temporarily. But this adds steps.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to have p1 in l2_4 without additional steps. For example, if after loading p1 into t2 at l2_5, drive to l2_4 and unload, then reload and drive to l2_1. But this adds steps.

But the constraint is satisfied as long as p1 is in l2_4 at any point after s0. So even if it's just for one step.

But in the problem's action model, the effects of drivetruck are that the truck is no longer in l_from and is now in l_to. So moving from l2_5 to l2_4 would place p1 (in the truck) at l2_4. So p1 is in the truck, but not in the location. So p1 is not in l2_4; the truck is. So unloading is required to have p1 in l2_4.

Thus, to have p1 in l2_4, we must unload it there. Which requires an additional unload and load action.

So this seems unavoidable.

At this point, I think the minimal plan that satisfies the constraints has 18 steps. But maybe I'm missing a more optimal way.

Alternatively, perhaps the constraints are satisfied in a different way. Let's re-examine the constraints:

The second constraint is: If p1 is in l2_5 in some state s, then in s or a state after s, either p1 is in l2_4 or p2 is in l2_2.

Since p1 is only in l2_5 in the initial state s0, the constraint requires that in s0 or after, either p1 is in l2_4 or p2 is in l2_2. Since in s0, neither is true, we must have at least one state after s0 where one of them holds.

So if we can find a way to have p2 in l2_2 during the plan, even for one step, that would satisfy the constraint.

But how?

Wait, when moving p2 from l2_5 to l2_3, we can first move it to l2_2, then to l2_3. But that adds steps.

But in the initial plan without constraint handling, p2 is moved directly from l2_5 to l2_3. So there's no step where p2 is in l2_2. Hence, the constraint is not satisfied.

Thus, the minimal plan must include moving p2 to l2_2, even if it's just a temporary step.

But how to do that with minimal steps.

Here's an idea:

After moving t2 to l2_5 to load p1, also load p2, drive to l2_2, unload p2, then continue to l2_1 with p1.

Steps:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
3. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
4. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
5. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (satisfies constraint)
6. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
7. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
... proceed with flying p1 to c1.

Then, after p1 is delivered, drive t2 back to l2_2 to get p2 and take it to l2_3:

8. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
9. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
10. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
11. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3

This results in 11 steps for p1 and p2. Plus the steps for flying p1:

12. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
13. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
14. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
15. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
16. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
17. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
18. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5

Total steps: 18.

This seems to be the minimal way. But is there a way to combine steps to reduce the count?

For example, steps 1-7 handle moving p1 and p2 to l2_2 and l2_1. Steps 8-11 handle moving p2 to l2_3. Steps 12-18 handle p1's journey via airplane and truck.

This totals 18 steps, which is longer than the original plan but necessary to satisfy the constraint.

Alternatively, after step5 (p2 in l2_2), perhaps we can move p2 to l2_3 directly. But after step5, t2 is at l2_2, and p2 is there. So:

After step5:

6. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
7. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
8. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3

But then, what about p1? After step5, p1 is still in t2. So steps would be:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
3. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
4. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
5. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
6. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
7. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
8. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (p2 delivered)
9. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2 (drive t2 to l2_1)
10. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
...

Then proceed with flying p1.

This way, p2 is delivered earlier, and p1's journey continues:

Steps:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
3. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
4. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
5. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (constraint satisfied)
6. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
7. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
8. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (p2 delivered)
9. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
10. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
11. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
12. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
13. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
14. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
15. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
16. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
17. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5

Total steps: 17. This seems better. Let's count:

Steps 1-8: 8 steps for p2 and initial steps for p1.

Steps 9-17: 9 steps for p1.

Total: 17 steps. Let's verify:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
3. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
4. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
5. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
6. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
7. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
8. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (p2 done)
9. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
10. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
11. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
12. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
13. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
14. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
15. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
16. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
17. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 (p1 done)

This is 17 steps. This plan satisfies the constraint because after s0, in step5, p2 is in l2_2. So it meets the constraint. Also, the steps are optimized by delivering p2 earlier and using the same truck for both packages.

This seems better. Now, checking if all steps are valid:

- After step4, t2 is at l2_2 with p1 and p2 loaded.

Step5: unload p2. Valid because t2 is at l2_2 and p2 is in t2.

Step6: load p2 again (is p2 in l2_2? Yes, after step5, p2 is at l2_2. But step6 is loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2. So p2 must be in l2_2 and t2 is there. Yes. So after step5, p2 is in l2_2. Then step6 loads p2 into t2.

Step7: drive to l2_3 and unload. Valid.

Step9: drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1 (since after step8, t2 is at l2_3).

Step10: unload p1 at l2_1. Valid.

Then proceed to fly and drive t1.

Yes, this plan seems valid and satisfies the constraints with 17 steps. Is this the optimal plan?

Possibly. Because combining the loading of both packages into t2 and delivering p2 first with a detour to l2_2 minimizes the steps. This way, we avoid having to make additional trips for p2 after handling p1.

Therefore, the final plan would be as follows:

```
```
drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2

```
