Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this planning problem. So the goal is to get package p1 to l1_4 and p2 to l2_4, right? And there's a constraint that at some point, either p2 is in l2_5 or p1 is in l2_6. Hmm, let's start by understanding the initial state.

First, looking at the initial state:

- Locations in city c1: l1_1 (airport), l1_2 to l1_8.
- Locations in city c2: l2_1 (airport), l2_2 to l2_8.
- Trucks t1 is in l1_4, t2 in l2_6.
- Packages: p1 is in l2_4, p2 in l2_7.
- Airplanes a1 in l1_1, a2 in l2_1.

So p1 is in city c2, location l2_4. The goal is to move p1 to c1's l1_4. Since cities are connected by airplanes (since airplanes can fly between airports), maybe we need to use an airplane to transport p1 from c2 to c1. Similarly, p2 needs to go from l2_7 to l2_4. That's within city c2, so maybe using truck t2, which is in l2_6. But let's think step by step.

For p1: starts in l2_4. To get to c1's l1_4, which is in another city. So steps could be: move p1 to an airport in c2 (l2_1), load onto airplane a2, fly to c1's airport l1_1, unload, then use a truck in c1 to take it to l1_4. But wait, the initial state says that truck t1 is in l1_4. So t1 is already in l1_4. So maybe after unloading p1 at l1_1, we need to drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1 to pick up p1? Wait, no. Wait, initially, where is truck t1? The original state says "Package t1 is in location l1_4". Wait, wait, that's a mistake. Wait, t1 is a truck, right? The objects listed include "truck t1", so the original state probably says "Truck t1 is in location l1_4". Similarly for t2. Let me check again.

Wait, looking back: The original state includes "Package t1 is in location l1_4". Wait, that's probably a typo. Because t1 is a truck, not a package. That must be a mistake. Because the problem defines the world as having trucks, airplanes, packages. So the correct initial state should state where the trucks are. So maybe there's an error in the original state description. For example, maybe "Truck t1 is in location l1_4" and "Truck t2 is in location l2_6". But the original state says "Package t1 is in l1_4", which seems wrong. This might be a typo. Let me recheck the original state:

Original state:

"Package t1 is in location l1_4"

"Package t2 is in location l2_6"

Wait, that's confusing. t1 and t2 are trucks, not packages. So maybe this is a typo, and it should be "Truck t1 is in location l1_4", same for t2. Otherwise, if t1 is a package, that's conflicting because the objects list includes "package p1", "package p2", "truck t1", etc. So I think the correct initial state is that the trucks are in those locations. The user probably made a typo here. So I'll proceed under the assumption that "Truck t1 is in l1_4" and "Truck t2 is in l2_6", and that "Package t1" etc., are typos. Otherwise, the problem doesn't make sense. Because otherwise, the trucks' locations are not specified, which is necessary for planning.

Assuming that the initial positions of the trucks are:

Truck t1 is in l1_4 (city c1).

Truck t2 is in l2_6 (city c2).

Packages p1 is in l2_4 (city c2), p2 in l2_7 (city c2).

Airplanes a1 in l1_1 (c1's airport), a2 in l2_1 (c2's airport).

So, to move p1 from l2_4 (c2) to l1_4 (c1):

First, we need to get p1 to an airport in c2, which is l2_1. So maybe use truck t2. But where is t2? Initially in l2_6. So t2 can drive to l2_4, load p1, drive to l2_1 (the airport), unload p1, then load it onto airplane a2, fly a2 to l1_1 (c1's airport), unload p1, then use truck t1 (in l1_4) to drive to l1_1, load p1, drive back to l1_4, and unload.

Wait, but truck t1 is in l1_4 initially. So to get p1 from l1_1 (airport) to l1_4, t1 needs to drive from l1_4 to l1_1 (airport), load p1, then drive back to l1_4 and unload. So that's two drive actions for t1.

For p2, which is in l2_7 (c2), needs to go to l2_4. Truck t2 is in l2_6. So t2 can drive to l2_7, load p2, drive to l2_4, unload.

But wait, p2's initial location is l2_7. So truck t2 is in l2_6. So first, drive t2 from l2_6 to l2_7 (same city c2), load p2, then drive to l2_4 and unload. That's possible.

But the constraint is that at some point in the plan, either p2 is in l2_5 or p1 is in l2_6. So during the plan, one of these conditions must be true. Let's think: in the plan for p2, when moving from l2_7 to l2_4, maybe the truck passes through l2_5? Or maybe we can route the truck through l2_5 to satisfy the constraint. But how do cities work? Each city's locations are connected via trucks, but how? The drivetruck action can move between any two locations in the same city. So the path isn't constrained by intermediate locations; you can drive directly between any two locations in the same city. So for t2 to go from l2_7 to l2_4, the drive is direct. Unless the problem requires specific routes, but according to the problem statement, the drivetruck action can move from any l_from to l_to in the same city, as long as they are in the same city. So the drive is direct. So if we need p2 to be in l2_5 at some point, perhaps we need to unload it there. But that's not part of the goal. So maybe, during the transportation of p2 from l2_7 to l2_4, we can first drive t2 to l2_5, unload p2 there (which would satisfy the constraint), then load it again and drive to l2_4. But that would add steps. But the plan must be optimal, so we need the shortest possible plan. Alternatively, maybe while moving p1, we can have it pass through l2_6. Wait, p1 starts in l2_4. To get to the airport l2_1, the truck t2 would drive from l2_6 to l2_4, load p1, drive to l2_1. But during that, when t2 is in l2_4, loading p1, then driving to l2_1, p1 is in the truck during the drive. So when the truck is moving from l2_4 to l2_1, perhaps the truck passes through l2_5? Wait, no. Because according to the drivetruck action, the movement is directly from l_from to l_to. There's no intermediate steps. So p1 is in the truck when it's driven from l2_4 to l2_1. So the only way p1 would be in l2_6 is if we unload it there. Which would require a detour, making the plan longer. But the constraint is that in at least one state, either p2 is in l2_5 or p1 is in l2_6. So maybe we can satisfy this constraint by having p2 go through l2_5 during its transportation. Let me see.

For p2: start at l2_7. Need to get to l2_4. If we take t2 from l2_6 to l2_7, load p2, drive to l2_5, unload (so p2 is in l2_5, satisfying the constraint), then load again and drive to l2_4. But that adds two extra steps (unload and load). Alternatively, maybe during the movement of p1, we can have p1 in l2_6. But how? Since p1 starts in l2_4. To get it to the airport, maybe we need to use truck t2 to move it. So t2 is initially in l2_6. So to load p1, t2 needs to be in l2_4. So first drive t2 from l2_6 to l2_4. Then load p1 into t2. Then drive t2 to l2_1 (airport). When driving from l2_4 to l2_1, if the drive is direct, then p1 is in t2 during that time. But the constraint requires that either p2 is in l2_5 or p1 is in l2_6. So unless we unload p1 in l2_6, which is not on the way, that's not happening. But if during the drive of t2 from l2_4 to l2_1, we take a detour via l2_6. But wait, drivetruck actions can directly move between any two locations in the same city. So t2 could drive from l2_4 to l2_6, then to l2_1. So in that case, after driving to l2_6, p1 is in t2 at l2_6. Then when unloading, p1 would be in l2_6. But that's not necessary. Alternatively, during the drive from l2_4 to l2_6 (if that's part of the path), but since the movement is direct, the truck is in l2_6 after the drive. But the package is still in the truck. So the package p1 would be in the truck at l2_6. So the package's location is the same as the truck's location. Wait, no. The package's location is in the truck. The truck's location is l2_6. So the package is inside the truck at l2_6. So the state would be that p1 is in t2, which is in l2_6. So the condition "Package p1 is in location l2_6" would not be true, because p1 is in the truck, not the location. So to have p1 in l2_6, we need to unload it there. So if we do that, then it would satisfy the constraint. But that would add steps: load p1 into t2 at l2_4, drive t2 to l2_6, unload p1 (now p1 is in l2_6), then load it again, drive to l2_1. Then fly to c1, etc. But this adds steps, making the plan longer. But the problem requires the optimal (shortest) plan. So maybe we can find a way to satisfy the constraint without adding steps. Alternatively, maybe when moving p2, we can have it pass through l2_5.

For p2: starts in l2_7. To get to l2_4. Truck t2 is initially in l2_6. So first, drive t2 from l2_6 to l2_7 (load p2), then drive to l2_4. But if instead, drive t2 from l2_6 to l2_5 (unload nothing, then to l2_7? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no. If we need to get p2 from l2_7 to l2_4, the truck needs to be in l2_7 to load it. So t2 starts in l2_6. Drive to l2_7, load p2, then drive to l2_5, unload p2 (satisfying the constraint), then load again and drive to l2_4. But that's two extra steps (unload and load). So the plan length increases. But the problem requires the optimal plan. So maybe there's a way to satisfy the constraint without adding steps. Let's think: perhaps during the transportation of p1, when t2 is moving from l2_4 to l2_1, but if the truck passes through l2_6? Wait, the movement is direct. So if we drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_6, then p1 is in the truck at l2_6. Then drive from l2_6 to l2_1. So during the first drive (l2_4 to l2_6), the truck is in l2_6 with p1. Then, in that state, p1 is in the truck at l2_6, which is not the same as being in the location l2_6. So the condition isn't met. So that approach doesn't work.

Alternatively, when transporting p2, perhaps we can route the truck through l2_5. For example:

t2 starts in l2_6.

Drive t2 from l2_6 to l2_7 (load p2).

Then drive t2 from l2_7 to l2_5 (unload p2 here, satisfying the constraint), then drive to l2_4 and load p2 again. Wait, no, that would require:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_6 l2_7 c2

2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_7

3. drivetruck t2 l2_7 l2_5 c2

4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 (now p2 is in l2_5, satisfying the constraint)

5. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5

6. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2

7. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

But that's 7 steps for p2, whereas if we do it directly, it would be:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_6 l2_7 c2

2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_7

3. drivetruck t2 l2_7 l2_4 c2

4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

So that's 4 steps. Adding steps to satisfy the constraint makes the plan longer. But the user requires an optimal plan, so we need to find a way to satisfy the constraint without increasing the number of steps. Wait, maybe the constraint can be satisfied during the transportation of p1.

Wait, when moving p1 from l2_4 to the airport l2_1, we can have the truck drive via l2_5. Wait, no. Because the movement is direct. So if t2 is at l2_4 and drives to l2_1, that's one action. The truck doesn't pass through any other locations. So the only way to get p1 into l2_5 or l2_6 is to unload it there. But that's out of the way.

Alternatively, maybe during the flight of the airplane. Wait, the constraint is about the packages being in certain locations. So if during the plan, p2 is moved to l2_5, even if it's later moved to l2_4, that's acceptable. So perhaps we can arrange to have p2 go through l2_5, which would satisfy the constraint. But how to do that without adding steps.

Wait, perhaps when moving p2 from l2_7 to l2_4, we can have the truck drive to l2_5 first. For example:

1. Drive t2 from l2_6 to l2_7 (load p2).

2. Drive t2 from l2_7 to l2_5 (unload p2 here, then load again, then drive to l2_4). But this would require:

- drivetruck t2 l2_6 l2_7 c2

- loadtruck p2 t2 l2_7

- drivetruck t2 l2_7 l2_5 c2

- unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 (constraint satisfied here)

- loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5

- drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2

- unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

But this adds two more steps compared to the direct route. But the problem requires the optimal plan. So this approach would not be optimal. So maybe there's another way.

Wait, maybe the constraint can be satisfied by one of the intermediate steps in the p1 transportation. Let's think about p1's journey.

p1 starts in l2_4. To get to c1's l1_4, the steps would be:

1. Truck t2 (in l2_6) drives to l2_4.

2. Load p1 into t2.

3. Drive t2 to l2_1 (airport).

4. Unload p1 at l2_1.

5. Load p1 into airplane a2.

6. Fly a2 to l1_1 (c1's airport).

7. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1.

8. Truck t1 (in l1_4) drives to l1_1.

9. Load p1 into t1.

10. Drive t1 back to l1_4.

11. Unload p1.

So that's 11 steps for p1. But during this process, when p1 is in l2_1 (airport), that's not helpful for the constraint. But when it's in the airplane a2, it's not in any location until it's unloaded. Wait, the constraint requires that "Package p2 is in location l2_5" OR "Package p1 is in location l2_6" at least once. So maybe during the movement of p1, if we can have it in l2_6, but how?

Alternatively, maybe during the p2 transportation, there's a step where p2 is in l2_5. For example, if after moving p2 to l2_4, we somehow move it to l2_5. But that's not needed for the goal. Alternatively, maybe the initial positions can be used. Wait, no. p2 starts in l2_7, so the initial state doesn't have it in l2_5 or l2_6. The constraint needs to be met during the plan execution.

Hmm. Let's consider combining steps. Suppose we handle p1 and p2 in parallel. For p2, the steps are:

1. t2 drives from l2_6 to l2_7.

2. load p2.

3. drive to l2_5 and unload (satisfy constraint), then load again and drive to l2_4. But that's adding steps. But maybe during the movement of p1, we can have a state where p1 is in l2_6. But how?

Wait, another idea: when moving p1 from l2_4 to the airport l2_1, maybe the truck t2 takes a detour via l2_6. So:

- t2 drives from l2_6 to l2_4 (load p1).

- then drive to l2_6 (so p1 is in t2 at l2_6).

Then drive to l2_1.

But when t2 is in l2_6 with p1, the package is inside the truck at l2_6. So the location of p1 is the truck's location, but p1 is in the truck. So the condition "p1 is in location l2_6" isn't met. The condition requires that the package is in the location, not in a vehicle in the location. So this wouldn't satisfy the constraint.

Another approach: maybe during the transportation of p1, we can unload it in l2_6. For example:

1. t2 drives from l2_6 to l2_4.

2. load p1 into t2.

3. drive t2 to l2_6.

4. unload p1 in l2_6 (satisfies the constraint).

5. load p1 again.

6. drive to l2_1.

7. unload, load into airplane, fly, etc.

But that adds steps (unload and load again), making the plan longer. But the problem requires the optimal plan. So this is not acceptable.

Alternatively, maybe when moving p2, we can first move it to l2_5, then to l2_4. For example:

For p2:

1. Drive t2 from l2_6 to l2_7.

2. Load p2.

3. Drive to l2_5, unload (satisfy constraint), then load again.

4. Drive to l2_4 and unload.

But this adds two steps (unload and load). So the plan for p2 becomes 6 steps instead of 4. Which is longer. So the optimal plan must not do this.

But the constraint must be satisfied. So maybe there's a way to have one of the steps in the p1 or p2 transportation naturally pass through a state that meets the constraint.

Wait, what if when moving p2 from l2_7 to l2_4, we have the truck drive through l2_5? But according to the problem's movement rules, the truck can drive directly from any location to any other in the same city. So if the truck drives from l2_7 to l2_5, that's a direct drive. Then from l2_5 to l2_4. So in that case, after the first drive, p2 is in the truck at l2_5. So the package is in the truck, not the location. So that doesn't satisfy the constraint. Unless we unload it there.

Hmm. This is tricky. Let's recap:

The constraints state that at least once during the plan, either p2 is in l2_5 or p1 is in l2_6.

We need to ensure that this condition is met in at least one state of the plan.

So perhaps the plan for p2 can be:

1. Drive t2 from l2_6 to l2_7.

2. Load p2.

3. Drive to l2_5.

4. Unload p2 (now in l2_5, satisfying the constraint).

5. Load p2 again.

6. Drive to l2_4.

7. Unload.

But this adds steps. Alternatively, maybe during the movement of p1, we can have p1 unloaded in l2_6. But that's out of the way.

Alternatively, maybe after delivering p1 to l1_4, we can move p2 via l2_5. But that would add steps after the main plan.

Wait, but the goal is to have p1 in l1_4 and p2 in l2_4. So the constraint must be met somewhere in the plan, not necessarily after the goal is achieved. So maybe during the plan's execution, before the final steps.

Let me think about combining the steps for p1 and p2.

For p1:

1. t2 drives from l2_6 to l2_4.

2. load p1 into t2.

3. drive t2 to l2_1.

4. unload p1.

5. load into airplane a2.

6. fly a2 to l1_1.

7. unload p1.

8. truck t1 drives from l1_4 to l1_1.

9. load p1 into t1.

10. drive t1 back to l1_4.

11. unload p1.

For p2:

1. t2 drives from l2_6 to l2_7.

2. load p2.

3. drive to l2_4.

4. unload.

But how do these steps interact? Let's see.

But t2 is used for both p1 and p2. So the steps must be ordered correctly. For example, first handle p1 with t2, then handle p2 with t2. Or vice versa.

But if we do p1 first, then after step 3 (drive t2 to l2_1), t2 is in l2_1. Then for p2, we need t2 to be in l2_6 again? But after moving to l2_1, t2 is there. So we can't use t2 for p2 unless we drive it back. Which adds steps.

Alternatively, maybe use another truck for p2? But the problem's objects include truck t2 in city c2. Wait, the trucks are t1 (in c1) and t2 (in c2). So for city c2, only t2 is available. So p2 must be transported using t2.

So the steps must be ordered such that t2 first handles p1, then p2. But that would require moving t2 back to l2_6 after delivering p1 to the airport. Which adds steps. But that's not efficient. Alternatively, maybe interleave the steps. Let me think:

If we first handle p2:

1. t2 drives from l2_6 to l2_7 (load p2).

2. drive to l2_4 (unload p2). Now p2 is in l2_4, which is the goal. But during this process, the constraint is not met. So we need to have p2 in l2_5 at some point.

Alternatively, drive to l2_5 first. But how.

Wait, perhaps during the transportation of p2, after loading it into t2 at l2_7, drive to l2_5 and unload (satisfy constraint), then load again and drive to l2_4.

But that's two extra steps, making the plan longer. But the problem requires the optimal plan, which is the shortest possible. So this approach might not be optimal.

Alternatively, find a way to have one of the steps naturally meet the constraint without adding steps. For example, maybe when moving p1, the truck t2 drives through l2_6. But when t2 is in l2_6 with p1 inside, does that count? No, because p1 is in the truck, not the location. So the constraint isn't met.

Hmm. Maybe the only way to satisfy the constraint is to have p2 unloaded at l2_5, even if it adds steps. But since the user requires the optimal plan, which is the shortest possible, perhaps there's a different approach.

Wait, what if we use the airplane a2 to transport p2? But p2 needs to stay in city c2, moving from l2_7 to l2_4. Airplanes can only move between airports. So l2_1 is the airport in c2. To use the airplane, we would need to load p2 into the airplane at l2_1, fly it to another airport, but since the destination is within c2, that's not helpful. So probably not useful.

Another idea: maybe use airplane a1 in c1 to help, but p2 is in c2. So no.

Alternatively, use the airplane a2 to move p2 from l2_1 to l2_1 (same place), which is useless.

So back to the original plan.

Let's consider the combined plan for p1 and p2, and see if any step naturally meets the constraint.

For p1:

Steps using t2:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_6 l2_4 c2

2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

3. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2

4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

Then load into airplane, fly, etc.

For p2:

Steps using t2 after p1 is done:

5. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_7 c2 (but this is not possible because after step 3, t2 is in l2_1. So to get to l2_7, t2 needs to drive from l2_1 to l2_7. But l2_1 is in c2, so yes.

6. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_7

7. drivetruck t2 l2_7 l2_4 c2

8. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

But during these steps, when does the constraint get satisfied? It doesn't. So the plan would be invalid because the constraint isn't met.

So we need to adjust the plan to meet the constraint.

Alternative approach: Find a way to have p2 pass through l2_5 during its transportation. For example:

For p2:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_6 l2_7 c2

2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_7

3. drivetruck t2 l2_7 l2_5 c2

4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 (constraint met here)

5. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5

6. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2

7. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

But this adds steps. Now, comparing to the original plan without the constraint, which for p2 would be 4 steps, this adds 3 steps. So the total plan length increases. But maybe there's a way to do this without adding steps by interleaving the steps for p1 and p2.

Alternatively, maybe we can have t2 handle both packages in a way that meets the constraint. For example:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_6 l2_7 c2

2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_7

3. drivetruck t2 l2_7 l2_5 c2

4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 (constraint met)

5. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5

6. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2

7. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

8. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_6 c2 (return to original position? Not needed.)

But this is for p2. Then for p1:

t2 needs to go from l2_6 to l2_4 to load p1. But after handling p2, t2 is in l2_4. So steps for p1:

9. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_4 c2 (no, already there)

Wait, no. After step 7, t2 is in l2_4. So to load p1, which is in l2_4, we can:

9. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

10. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2

11. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

Then proceed with airplane steps.

But this way, the total steps for p2 are 7, and for p1, 3 steps. Then airplane steps. But this makes the plan longer than necessary. So this approach isn't optimal.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let's think differently. The constraint is that either p2 is in l2_5 or p1 is in l2_6 at some state. What's the minimal way to achieve this?

Maybe during the transportation of p1, after loading it into t2 at l2_4, we drive t2 to l2_6, unload p1 there (satisfying the constraint), then load it again and drive to l2_1.

So steps for p1:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_6 l2_4 c2

2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

3. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_6 c2

4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_6 (constraint met here)

5. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_6

6. drivetruck t2 l2_6 l2_1 c2

7. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

Then proceed with flying.

For p2:

After step 7, t2 is in l2_1. So steps for p2 would be:

8. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_7 c2

9. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_7

10. drivetruck t2 l2_7 l2_4 c2

11. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

But this way, the constraint is met at step 4. The total steps for p1 are 7 steps (up to step 7), and for p2, 4 steps. But the total plan would be 11 steps for p1 and 4 for p2, but since they're interleaved, maybe overlapping.

But this plan has more steps than necessary. The optimal plan should be as short as possible. So this approach might not be optimal.

Alternatively, maybe after moving p1 to the airport, during the flight, there's a step where p1 is in l2_6. No, the flight is between airports. So the airplane moves from l2_1 to l1_1. So during the flight, p1 is in the airplane, not in any location.

So another idea: what if we use airplane a2 to transport p2 from l2_1 to l2_1 (no movement), but that's useless. Or maybe fly to another airport, but there's no need.

Another approach: Use airplane a2 to carry p2 to another city and back, but that's unnecessary and increases steps.

Wait, perhaps the constraint can be satisfied during the p2 transportation without adding steps. For example, if the truck drives from l2_7 to l2_4 via l2_5. But according to the problem's movement rules, driving is direct between any two locations. So driving from l2_7 to l2_5 would be one action, then from l2_5 to l2_4 another. But during the first drive, p2 is in the truck at l2_5. So the package is in the truck, not the location. So the constraint isn't met. Unless we unload.

So this approach requires two extra steps.

I think the only way to satisfy the constraint is to have one extra unload and load for p2, which adds two steps. But the problem requires the optimal plan, which is the shortest possible. So maybe there's a way to combine steps so that the constraint is met without adding steps.

Wait, let's think about the initial state. Are there any packages already in the required locations? No. p1 is in l2_4, p2 in l2_7. So no.

Wait, perhaps the plan can be structured such that when moving p1, the truck t2 is driven from l2_6 to l2_4, load p1, then drive to l2_6 again (unloading there). So:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_6 l2_4 c2

2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

3. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_6 c2

4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_6 (constraint met here)

5. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_6

6. drivetruck t2 l2_6 l2_1 c2

7. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

Then fly to c1, etc.

This way, during step 4, p1 is in l2_6, satisfying the constraint. But this adds two steps (steps 3 and 4). Then steps 5-7 are needed. So for p1, this is 7 steps instead of the original 5. So the total plan becomes longer. But the problem requires the optimal plan. So this is not optimal.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find a way to have the constraint satisfied during the normal steps without adding any steps.

Wait, when t2 is moving p1 from l2_4 to l2_1, is there a way to have the truck pass through l2_5 or l2_6? But according to the problem, driving is direct. So if the truck drives from l2_4 to l2_1 directly, there's no intermediate location. So the package is only in the truck during the drive, and the truck's location changes from l2_4 to l2_1 in one step. So no intermediate states where the package is in another location.

This is really challenging. Let's try to outline a possible plan that satisfies the constraint and is optimal.

Plan for p1:

1. Drive t2 from l2_6 to l2_4 (c2).

2. Load p1 into t2.

3. Drive t2 to l2_1 (airport).

4. Unload p1.

5. Load p1 into airplane a2.

6. Fly a2 to l1_1 (c1's airport).

7. Unload p1.

8. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1.

9. Load p1 into t1.

10. Drive t1 back to l1_4.

11. Unload p1.

Plan for p2:

12. Drive t2 from l2_1 (where it was left after step 3) to l2_7 (c2).

13. Load p2 into t2.

14. Drive t2 to l2_5 (c2).

15. Unload p2 (satisfy constraint here).

16. Load p2 again.

17. Drive to l2_4.

18. Unload.

But this adds steps for p2. But the initial plan for p1 requires t2 to be in l2_1 after step 3. Then to handle p2, t2 needs to drive back to l2_7, which is possible but adds steps. The total steps would be 18, which is not optimal.

Alternatively, perhaps handle p2 first.

Plan for p2:

1. Drive t2 from l2_6 to l2_7.

2. Load p2.

3. Drive to l2_5 and unload (constraint met).

4. Load again.

5. Drive to l2_4 and unload.

Then handle p1:

6. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_4 (no action needed).

7. Load p1 (but t2 is already in l2_4).

Wait, t2 is in l2_4 after step 5. So steps for p1:

6. Load p1 into t2.

7. Drive t2 to l2_1.

8. Unload.

9. Load into airplane, etc.

But this way, the total steps are 5 for p2 and then 7 for p1, totaling 12 steps. But the optimal plan should be shorter.

Alternatively, maybe the steps can be interleaved.

Wait, after step 5 (unload p2 at l2_4), t2 is in l2_4. So p1 is in l2_4. So step 6 is load p1 into t2.

Then drive to l2_1. So:

6. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

7. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2

8. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

Then fly to c1, etc.

But this way, the steps for p2 are steps 1-5, and for p1 steps 6-8 plus fly steps. So total steps for p1: 8 steps (including fly, unload, truck t1 steps).

But I'm not sure if this is optimal.

But according to the constraint, we need to meet the condition at least once. In this plan, during step 3, p2 is unloaded at l2_5, satisfying the constraint. So this plan meets the constraint. Now, let's count the total steps:

For p2:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_6 l2_7 c2

2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_7

3. drivetruck t2 l2_7 l2_5 c2

4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5

5. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5

6. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2

7. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

That's 7 steps for p2.

For p1:

8. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (t2 is already in l2_4 after step 7)

9. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2

10. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

11. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

12. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

13. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

14. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1

15. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

16. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

17. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

Total steps: 17. But is this optimal? Could we find a shorter plan?

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to combine steps. For example, after step 7 (unload p2 at l2_4), t2 is in l2_4 with p1 there. So load p1 into t2 and drive to l2_1. That's steps 8-10.

Then fly to c1, unload, and use t1 to deliver. But this seems to be the minimal steps for p1.

But the total steps are 17, which might not be optimal. But the key is to find the shortest plan that meets the constraint.

But perhaps there's a smarter way. Let's think again.

What if during the transportation of p2, we drive from l2_7 to l2_5 (unload there), then to l2_4. But this requires two extra steps. But maybe we can do it in a way that the steps are fewer.

Wait, for p2:

1. t2 starts in l2_6.

2. drive to l2_7 (1).

3. load p2 (2).

4. drive to l2_5 (3).

5. unload (4) → constraint met.

6. load again (5).

7. drive to l2_4 (6).

8. unload (7).

Total steps for p2: 7.

For p1:

1. t2 is in l2_4 after step 8.

2. load p1 (8).

3. drive to l2_1 (9).

4. unload (10).

5. load into a2 (11).

6. fly to l1_1 (12).

7. unload (13).

8. t1 drives from l1_4 to l1_1 (14).

9. load p1 (15).

10. drive back to l1_4 (16).

11. unload (17).

So total steps: 17.

But if we can find a way to meet the constraint without adding steps, that would be better.

Wait, another idea: If we move p2 from l2_7 to l2_4 via l2_6. So:

1. t2 drives from l2_6 to l2_7 (1).

2. load p2 (2).

3. drive to l2_6 (3).

4. unload p2 (4) → now p2 is in l2_6, but that's not one of the required locations (constraint is l2_5 or p1 in l2_6). So p2 in l2_6 doesn't satisfy the constraint.

Wait, the constraint is "Package p2 is in location l2_5" OR "Package p1 is in location l2_6".

So if p2 is in l2_5, or p1 is in l2_6.

So if during the plan, p2 is in l2_5, even if only temporarily, that's sufficient.

So perhaps when moving p2 from l2_7 to l2_4, we can first move to l2_5, unload (satisfy constraint), then move to l2_4. This would add two steps (unload and load). But maybe this is the only way.

Alternatively, during the p1 transportation, after loading into t2, drive to l2_6 and unload p1 there, then reload and continue. This adds steps but meets the constraint.

But again, the problem requires the optimal plan. So the minimal steps needed.

Hmm. I think the minimal plan that satisfies the constraint would involve adding two steps for p2 to go through l2_5. Let's write that plan and see.

Plan:

For p2:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_6 l2_7 c2

2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_7

3. drivetruck t2 l2_7 l2_5 c2

4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 (constraint met here)

5. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5

6. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2

7. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

For p1:

8. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_4 c2 (no action needed; t2 is already there)

9. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

10. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2

11. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

12. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

13. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

14. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

15. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1

16. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

17. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

18. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

So total steps: 18.

But this is longer than necessary. Is there a way to interleave steps or optimize?

Alternatively, after step 7 (p2 delivered), t2 is in l2_4. Then steps for p1 can be:

8. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

9. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2

10. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

Then proceed with flying and truck t1 steps. So p1's steps are steps 8-10 plus flying and t1 steps.

So for p1, steps 8-10, then:

11. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

12. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

13. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

14. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1

15. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

16. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

17. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

So total steps for p2: 7, for p1: 10. Total steps: 17.

But this seems to be the minimal steps required to satisfy the constraint. However, I'm not sure if there's a shorter way.

Alternatively, maybe during the p1 transportation, we can use a different sequence that meets the constraint.

Wait, when p1 is loaded into t2 at l2_4 (step 9), then driven to l2_1. If we drive to l2_5 first, unload p1 there (which is not required but would satisfy the constraint if p2 is in l2_5). Wait, no. The constraint requires p2 in l2_5 OR p1 in l2_6. So unloading p1 in l2_5 doesn't help. Unless we drive to l2_6.

So:

For p1:

8. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_6 c2

9. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_6 (constraint met here)

10. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_6

11. drivetruck t2 l2_6 l2_1 c2

12. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

Then proceed with flying.

This adds steps 8-9-10-11-12. So steps 8-12 for p1, which is 5 steps. For p2, steps 1-7 (7 steps). Total steps: 12 + steps for flying and t1. So total steps would be 12 + 5 (fly and truck t1 steps) = 17.

So again, total steps are 17.

But the optimal plan must be the shortest possible. So perhaps 17 steps is the minimal, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to meet the constraint in fewer steps.

Another idea: Maybe during the movement of p1, the airplane a2 is used to fly from l2_1 to l2_6. Wait, but airplanes can only land at airports. l2_6 is not an airport. So no.

Alternatively, have p1 fly to l1_1, then drive t1 to l1_6 and unload there. But that's not part of the goal. Not helpful.

Hmm. I think the minimal plan that satisfies the constraint is the one where p2 is unloaded at l2_5, adding two steps for p2's transportation. So the total steps are 17. However, I'm not entirely sure, but this seems to be the only way to satisfy the constraint given the problem's requirements.
