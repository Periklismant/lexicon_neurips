Let me break down this problem and analyze the state model for this planning domain.

The domain involves cities, locations, trucks, airplanes, and packages. We need to transport packages p1 and p2 to specific locations.

Initial state:
- Package p1 is in location l2_4
- Package p2 is in location l2_7
- Truck t1 is in location l1_4
- Truck t2 is in location l2_6
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (airport in city c1)
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1 (airport in city c2)

Goal state:
- Package p1 is in location l1_4
- Package p2 is in location l2_4

Constraint:
- At some point during execution, at least one of these must be true:
  - Package p2 is in location l2_5
  - Package p1 is in location l2_6

Let me think about how to plan this:

For p1:
- p1 is initially in l2_4 (city c2)
- p1 needs to be moved to l1_4 (city c1)
- This requires using an airplane since we need to move between cities
- We need to get p1 to airport l2_1, fly to l1_1, then transport to l1_4

For p2:
- p2 is initially in l2_7 (city c2)
- p2 needs to be moved to l2_4 (city c2)
- We can use a truck since the locations are in the same city

Additionally, we need to satisfy the constraint that at some point either:
- p2 is in l2_5, or
- p1 is in l2_6

Let's plan the movements:

For p1:
1. We need a truck to pick up p1 from l2_4
2. Truck t2 is in l2_6, so we need to move it to l2_4
3. Load p1 onto t2
4. Drive t2 to the airport l2_1
5. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1
6. Load p1 onto airplane a2 (which is at l2_1)
7. Fly a2 to l1_1
8. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1
9. Load p1 onto truck t1 (assuming we've moved t1 to l1_1)
10. Drive t1 to l1_4
11. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_4

For p2:
1. We need a truck to pick up p2 from l2_7
2. Truck t2 could be used, so we'd need to move it to l2_7
3. Load p2 onto t2
4. Drive t2 to l2_4
5. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_4

To satisfy the constraint, we could:
- Have t2 drive through l2_5 when moving p2 from l2_7 to l2_4, or
- Drive p1 through l2_6 on its way to the airport

Let me plan the optimal solution, making sure to satisfy the constraint:

Initial plan for p1:
- t2 is in l2_6
- p1 is in l2_4
- Move t2 from l2_6 to l2_4
- Load p1 onto t2 at l2_4
- Drive t2 to l2_1 (airport)
- Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1
- Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1
- Fly a2 to l1_1
- Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1
- t1 is in l1_4, so move t1 from l1_4 to l1_1
- Load p1 onto t1 at l1_1
- Drive t1 back to l1_4
- Unload p1 from t1 at l1_4

Initial plan for p2:
- After moving p1, t2 is at l2_1
- Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_7
- Load p2 onto t2 at l2_7
- To satisfy the constraint, we'll drive t2 from l2_7 to l2_5
- Then drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_4
- Unload p2 from t2 at l2_4

Wait, I need to review the initial state again. Actually, I noticed a mistake in my understanding. Let me re-read the initial state:

```
"Package t1 is in location l1_4"
"Package t2 is in location l2_6"
"Package p1 is in location l2_4"
"Package p2 is in location l2_7"
"Package a1 is in location l1_1"
"Package a2 is in location l2_1"
```

It looks like there's confusion in the problem statement. The trucks (t1, t2) and airplanes (a1, a2) are labeled as packages. I'm going to assume the intended meaning is:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_4
- Truck t2 is in location l2_6
- Package p1 is in location l2_4
- Package p2 is in location l2_7
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

With that clarification, let me replan:

For p1 (from l2_4 to l1_4):
1. Drive t2 from l2_6 to l2_4
2. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_4
3. Drive t2 to l2_1 (airport)
4. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1
5. Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1
6. Fly a2 to l1_1
7. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1
8. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1
9. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_1
10. Drive t1 back to l1_4
11. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_4

For p2 (from l2_7 to l2_4):
1. After moving p1, t2 is at l2_1
2. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_7
3. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_7
4. To satisfy the constraint, we'll drive t2 from l2_7 to l2_5
5. Then drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_4
6. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_4

Let's check if this plan satisfies the constraint. The constraint is that at some point, either:
- p2 is in l2_5, or
- p1 is in l2_6

In our plan:
- p2 will be in t2 when t2 is in l2_5, but p2 itself won't be "in location l2_5"
- p1 doesn't go through l2_6

Let me adjust the plan to satisfy the constraint:

For p1 (from l2_4 to l1_4):
1. Drive t2 from l2_6 to l2_4
2. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_4
3. To satisfy the constraint, drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_6 (now p1 is in t2 at l2_6)
4. Drive t2 from l2_6 to l2_1 (airport)
5. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1
6. Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1
7. Fly a2 to l1_1
8. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1
9. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1
10. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_1
11. Drive t1 back to l1_4
12. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_4

For p2 (from l2_7 to l2_4):
1. After moving p1, t2 is at l2_1
2. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_7
3. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_7
4. Drive t2 from l2_7 to l2_5 (to satisfy constraint if needed)
5. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_5 (this satisfies "p2 is in location l2_5")
6. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_5
7. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_4
8. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_4

Actually, let's determine if this is the optimal solution. Let me count the number of actions:

For p1:
1. drivetruck t2 l2_6 l2_4 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
3. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_6 c2 (for constraint)
4. drivetruck t2 l2_6 l2_1 c2
5. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
6. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
7. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
8. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
9. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
10. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
11. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
12. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

For p2:
13. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_7 c2
14. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_7
15. drivetruck t2 l2_7 l2_5 c2
16. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
17. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
18. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2
19. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

That's 19 actions total.

But actually, I realize there's another way to satisfy the constraint:
- We need either "p2 is in location l2_5" or "p1 is in location l2_6"

For the first scenario, we can have:
- drivetruck t2 from l2_7 to l2_5
- unloadtruck p2 from t2 at l2_5
- loadtruck p2 onto t2 at l2_5

For the second scenario, we can have:
- drive t2 to l2_6 with p1 inside
- unload p1 from t2 at l2_6
- load p1 back into t2 at l2_6

Actually, I realize there's another problem with my planning. After I unload p1 from t2 at l2_1, I need to use t2 to transport p2. This means t1 won't be involved in transporting p1.

Let me re-plan from scratch:

For p1 (from l2_4 to l1_4):
1. Drive t2 from l2_6 to l2_4
2. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_4
3. Drive t2 to l2_1 (airport)
4. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1
5. Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1
6. Fly a2 to l1_1
7. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1
8. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1
9. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_1
10. Drive t1 back to l1_4
11. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_4

For p2 (from l2_7 to l2_4):
12. After moving p1, t2 is at l2_1
13. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_7
14. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_7
15. Drive t2 from l2_7 to l2_5 (to satisfy constraint)
16. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_5 (this satisfies "p2 is in location l2_5")
17. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_5
18. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_4
19. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_4

Wait, I need to re-examine the constraint. It says:

"The following expression must hold in at least one state: 
   "At least one of the following conditions is true: "Package p2 is in location l2_5", "Package p1 is in location l2_6"""

This means that at some point during plan execution, either p2 must be physically in location l2_5 (not in a truck) or p1 must be physically in location l2_6 (not in a truck).

Let me continue with the plan I was developing:

For p1 (from l2_4 to l1_4):
1. Drive t2 from l2_6 to l2_4
2. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_4
3. Drive t2 to l2_1 (airport)
4. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1
5. Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1
6. Fly a2 to l1_1
7. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1
8. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1
9. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_1
10. Drive t1 back to l1_4
11. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_4

For p2 (from l2_7 to l2_4):
12. After moving p1, t2 is at l2_1
13. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_7
14. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_7
15. Drive t2 from l2_7 to l2_5
16. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_5 (this satisfies the constraint)
17. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_5
18. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_4
19. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_4

This plan has 19 actions and satisfies the constraint.

Let me see if I can find a more optimal solution:

Satisfying the constraint with p1 in l2_6:
- Drive t2 from l2_6 to l2_4
- Load p1 onto t2 at l2_4
- Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_6
- Unload p1 from t2 at l2_6 (constraint satisfied)
- Load p1 onto t2 at l2_6
- Drive t2 to l2_1
- Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1
- Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1
- Fly a2 to l1_1
- Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1
- Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1
- Load p1 onto t1 at l1_1
- Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_4
- Unload p1 from t1 at l1_4

And continuing for p2:
- Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_7
- Load p2 onto t2 at l2_7
- Drive t2 from l2_7 to l2_4
- Unload p2 from t2 at l2_4

This is 18 actions, which is indeed one fewer than my previous plan.

Let me verify both plans to ensure they're actually valid:

Plan 1 (19 actions):
1. drivetruck t2 l2_6 l2_4 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
3. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
5. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
6. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
7. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
8. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
9. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
10. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
11. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
12. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_7 c2
13. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_7
14. drivetruck t2 l2_7 l2_5 c2
15. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 (constraint satisfied)
16. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
17. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2
18. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

I miscounted - that's 18 actions, not 19.

Plan 2 (18 actions):
1. drivetruck t2 l2_6 l2_4 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
3. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_6 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_6 (constraint satisfied)
5. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_6
6. drivetruck t2 l2_6 l2_1 c2
7. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
8. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
9. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
10. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
11. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
12. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
13. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
14. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
15. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_7 c2
16. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_7
17. drivetruck t2 l2_7 l2_4 c2
18. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

Both plans have 18 actions, so they're equivalent in length.

Actually, let me see if I can optimize further by changing the order:

For p2 (from l2_7 to l2_4):
1. Drive t2 from l2_6 to l2_7
2. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_7
3. Drive t2 from l2_7 to l2_5
4. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_5 (constraint satisfied)
5. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_5
6. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_4
7. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_4

For p1 (from l2_4 to l1_4):
8. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_4 (already there)
9. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_4
10. Drive t2 to l2_1 (airport)
11. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1
12. Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1
13. Fly a2 to l1_1
14. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1
15. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1
16. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_1
17. Drive t1 back to l1_4
18. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_4

This is also 18 actions, though step 8 can be eliminated since t2 is already at l2_4, making it 17 actions.

Let me check one more approach: what if we use only t2 for both packages (not using t1 at all)?

For p2 (from l2_7 to l2_4):
1. Drive t2 from l2_6 to l2_7
2. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_7
3. Drive t2 from l2_7 to l2_5
4. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_5 (constraint satisfied)
5. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_5
6. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_4
7. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_4

For p1 (from l2_4 to l1_4):
8. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_4
9. Drive t2 to l2_1 (airport)
10. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1
11. Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1
12. Fly a2 to l1_1
13. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1
14. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1
15. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_1
16. Drive t1 back to l1_4
17. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_4

This is 17 actions, which seems optimal.

Let me actually examine this more carefully to make sure there are no inconsistencies in my planning:

Initial state:
- Package p1 is in location l2_4
- Package p2 is in location l2_7
- Truck t1 is in location l1_4
- Truck t2 is in location l2_6
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (airport in city c1)
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1 (airport in city c2)

My final plan is:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_6 l2_7 c2
2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_7
3. drivetruck t2 l2_7 l2_5 c2
4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 (constraint satisfied)
5. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
6. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2
7. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
8. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
9. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
10. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
11. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
12. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
13. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
14. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
15. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
16. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
17. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

Let me trace through this plan to check for correctness:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_6 l2_7 c2
   - t2 is now at l2_7

2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_7
   - p2 is now in t2
   - p2 is no longer at l2_7

3. drivetruck t2 l2_7 l2_5 c2
   - t2 (with p2) is now at l2_5

4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
   - p2 is now at l2_5 (constraint satisfied)
   - p2 is no longer in t2

5. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
   - p2 is now in t2
   - p2 is no longer at l2_5

6. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2
   - t2 (with p2) is now at l2_4

7. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
   - p2 is now at l2_4 (first goal achieved)
   - p2 is no longer in t2

8. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
   - p1 is now in t2
   - p1 is no longer at l2_4

9. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
   - t2 (with p1) is now at l2_1

10. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
    - p1 is now at l2_1
    - p1 is no longer in t2

11. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
    - p1 is now in a2
    - p1 is no longer at l2_1

12. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
    - a2 (with p1) is now at l1_1

13. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
    - p1 is now at l1_1
    - p1 is no longer in a2

14. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
    - t1 is now at l1_1

15. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
    - p1 is now in t1
    - p1 is no longer at l1_1

16. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
    - t1 (with p1) is now at l1_4

17. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
    - p1 is now at l1_4 (second goal achieved)
    - p1 is no longer in t1

This satisfies both goal conditions:
- p1 is at l1_4
- p2 is at l2_4

And it satisfies the constraint by having p2 at l2_5 at one point.

This 17-action plan appears to be optimal and correct. Let me double-check that I haven't missed any other optimization opportunities:

Could we handle p1 first?
- Drive t2 from l2_6 to l2_4
- Load p1 onto t2 at l2_4
- Drive t2 to l2_1
- Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1
- Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1
- Fly a2 to l1_1
- Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1
- Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1
- Load p1 onto t1 at l1_1
- Drive t1 back to l1_4
- Unload p1 from t1 at l1_4
- Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_7
- Load p2 onto t2 at l2_7
- Drive t2 from l2_7 to l2_5
- Unload p2 from t2 at l2_5 (constraint satisfied)
- Load p2 onto t2 at l2_5
- Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_4
- Unload p2 from t2 at l2_4

That's 18 actions, which is more than my current plan.

Let me double-check my plan one more time:

Final Plan (17 actions):
1. drivetruck t2 l2_6 l2_7 c2
2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_7
3. drivetruck t2 l2_7 l2_5 c2
4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 (constraint satisfied)
5. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
6. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2
7. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
8. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
9. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
10. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
11. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
12. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
13. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
14. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
15. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
16. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
17. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

I'm satisfied that this is the correct optimal solution with 17 actions.

Oops, I just noticed that unloadairplane was duplicated in the action set provided. The actions should be:
- "loadtruck p t l"
- "loadairplane p ap l"
- "unloadtruck p t l"
- "unloadairplane p ap l"
- "drivetruck t l_from l_to c"
- "flyairplane ap l_from l_to"

So action #13 should be:
13. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

And checking the actions more carefully, action #11 for "loadairplane" looks correct.

Let me ensure my final plan is correct with the proper action names:

Final Plan (17 actions):
1. drivetruck t2 l2_6 l2_7 c2
2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_7
3. drivetruck t2 l2_7 l2_5 c2
4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 (constraint satisfied)
5. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
6. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2
7. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
8. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
9. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
10. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
11. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
12. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
13. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
14. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
15. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
16. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
17. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

This is the final answer, and I believe it is optimal.
