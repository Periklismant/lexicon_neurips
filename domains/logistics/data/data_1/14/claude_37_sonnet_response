In this problem, we need to come up with a plan to transport two packages, p1 and p2, to specific locations, l1_2 and l1_4 respectively, while satisfying certain constraints.

First, let's understand the current state of the world:

- Locations in city c1: l1_1 (airport), l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5
- Locations in city c2: l2_1 (airport), l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5
- Package p1 is in location l1_1 (airport of city c1)
- Package p2 is in location l2_5 (in city c2)
- Truck t1 is in location l1_5 (in city c1)
- Truck t2 is in location l2_4 (in city c2)
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (airport of city c1)
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1 (airport of city c2)

The goal is to have:
- Package p1 in location l1_2
- Package p2 in location l1_4

Constraints:
1. "Package p2 is in location l2_5" must hold in at least one state in our plan, which means we can't move p2 directly from its starting location.
2. If p2 is in l2_5, then at some point after that, it must be in l2_4.

Wait, I see an issue with the initial state specification. It says "Package t1 is in location l1_5" and "Package t2 is in location l2_4", but t1 and t2 are trucks, not packages. Let's assume that the intention was to say:

- Truck t1 is in location l1_5
- Truck t2 is in location l2_4

Similarly, it says "Package a1 is in location l1_1" and "Package a2 is in location l2_1", but a1 and a2 are airplanes, not packages. Let's assume the intention was:

- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

Let me now plan the steps:

For package p1:
1. Load p1 onto airplane a1 at l1_1 (both are already there)
2. Fly airplane a1 from l1_1 to l2_1
3. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1
4. Load p1 onto truck t2 (need to move t2 to l2_1 first)
5. Drive truck t2 to l1_2
6. Unload p1 at l1_2

But wait, I didn't realize that a truck can't move between cities. I need a different plan for p1:

1. Load p1 onto airplane a1 at l1_1
2. Fly a1 to l1_1 (it's already there, so this is unnecessary)
3. Unload p1 from a1 at l1_1 (this is unnecessary as p1 is already at l1_1)
4. Move truck t1 from l1_5 to l1_1
5. Load p1 onto truck t1 at l1_1
6. Drive truck t1 from l1_1 to l1_2
7. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_2

For package p2:
1. Based on the constraints, p2 is already in l2_5, and we need to first move it to l2_4 and then to l1_4.
2. Move truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_5
3. Load p2 onto truck t2 at l2_5
4. Drive truck t2 from l2_5 to l2_4 (to satisfy constraint 2)
5. Drive truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_1 (to reach the airport)
6. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1
7. Load p2 onto airplane a2 at l2_1
8. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1
9. Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1
10. Load p2 onto truck t1 at l1_1 (assuming t1 is now at l1_1 from the p1 plan)
11. Drive truck t1 from l1_1 to l1_4
12. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_4

Let's refine the combined plan:

1. Move truck t1 from l1_5 to l1_1 (drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1)
2. Load p1 onto truck t1 at l1_1 (loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1)
3. Drive truck t1 from l1_1 to l1_2 (drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1)
4. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_2 (unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2)
5. Move truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_5 (drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2)
6. Load p2 onto truck t2 at l2_5 (loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5)
7. Drive truck t2 from l2_5 to l2_4 (drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2)
8. Drive truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_1 (drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2)
9. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1 (unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1)
10. Load p2 onto airplane a2 at l2_1 (loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1)
11. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1 (flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1)
12. Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1 (unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1)
13. Drive truck t1 from l1_2 to l1_1 (drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1)
14. Load p2 onto truck t1 at l1_1 (loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1)
15. Drive truck t1 from l1_1 to l1_4 (drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1)
16. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_4 (unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4)

Actually, I've been misreading the action "loadairplane" and "unloadairplane". Let me fix those:

1. Move truck t1 from l1_5 to l1_1 (drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1)
2. Load p1 onto truck t1 at l1_1 (loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1)
3. Drive truck t1 from l1_1 to l1_2 (drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1)
4. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_2 (unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2)
5. Move truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_5 (drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2)
6. Load p2 onto truck t2 at l2_5 (loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5)
7. Drive truck t2 from l2_5 to l2_4 (drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2)
8. Drive truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_1 (drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2)
9. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1 (unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1)
10. Load p2 onto airplane a2 at l2_1 (loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1)
11. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1 (flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1)
12. Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1 (unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1)
13. Drive truck t1 from l1_2 to l1_1 (drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1)
14. Load p2 onto truck t1 at l1_1 (loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1)
15. Drive truck t1 from l1_1 to l1_4 (drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1)
16. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_4 (unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4)

Actually, I need to re-check the unloadairplane action to ensure I'm understanding it correctly:

"unloadairplane p ap l": Unload package p from airplane ap in location l.

And the preconditions are:
"unloadairplane": You may only unload package p from a airplane ap in a location l if (i) ap is situated in l, and (ii) p is in ap.

I think my plan is correct. Let's double-check the entire plan for correctness and efficiency:

Initial state:
- Package p1 is in location l1_1
- Package p2 is in location l2_5
- Truck t1 is in location l1_5
- Truck t2 is in location l2_4
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

For package p1, we need to move it from l1_1 to l1_2.
For package p2, we need to move it from l2_5 to l1_4, but with the constraints that it must be in l2_5 at least once, and after it's in l2_5, it must also be in l2_4.

Let's optimize this plan a bit:

1. Move truck t1 from l1_5 to l1_1 (drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1)
2. Load p1 onto truck t1 at l1_1 (loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1)
3. Drive truck t1 from l1_1 to l1_2 (drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1)
4. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_2 (unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2)

Package p1 is now in l1_2, which completes the first goal. Now for package p2:

5. Move truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_5 (drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2) - Note: p2 is already at l2_5, so this meets the constraint that "Package p2 is in location l2_5" holds in at least one state.
6. Load p2 onto truck t2 at l2_5 (loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5)
7. Drive truck t2 from l2_5 to l2_4 (drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2) - This meets the constraint that after p2 is in l2_5, it must be in l2_4.
8. Drive truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_1 (drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2)
9. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1 (unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1)
10. Load p2 onto airplane a2 at l2_1 (loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1)
11. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1 (flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1)
12. Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1 (unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1)
13. Drive truck t1 from l1_2 to l1_1 (drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1)
14. Load p2 onto truck t1 at l1_1 (loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1)
15. Drive truck t1 from l1_1 to l1_4 (drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1)
16. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_4 (unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4)

Actually, I need to reevaluate the constraints for p2 one more time. Let me double-check:

1. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'Package p2 is in location l2_5'".
2. "If expression 'Package p2 is in location l2_5' holds in some state s, then expression 'Package p2 is in location l2_4' must hold at s or at some state after s."

Based on the initial state, p2 is already in l2_5, so the first constraint is already satisfied. The second constraint states that after we have a state where p2 is in l2_5, we also need a state where p2 is in l2_4. This could be satisfied by moving p2 from l2_5 to l2_4 at some point.

Let's simplify the plan:

1. Move truck t1 from l1_5 to l1_1 (drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1)
2. Load p1 onto truck t1 at l1_1 (loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1)
3. Drive truck t1 from l1_1 to l1_2 (drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1)
4. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_2 (unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2)
5. Move truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_5 (drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2)
6. Load p2 onto truck t2 at l2_5 (loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5)
7. Drive truck t2 from l2_5 to l2_4 (drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2)
8. Drive truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_1 (drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2)
9. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1 (unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1)
10. Load p2 onto airplane a2 at l2_1 (loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1)
11. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1 (flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1)
12. Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1 (unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1)
13. Load p2 onto truck t1 at l1_2 (loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2) - Wait, that's not possible
13. Drive truck t1 from l1_2 to l1_1 (drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1)
14. Load p2 onto truck t1 at l1_1 (loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1)
15. Drive truck t1 from l1_1 to l1_4 (drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1)
16. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_4 (unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4)

Actually, there's one more error I noticed. I said "Load p2 onto truck t1 at l1_2 (loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2)". This isn't possible since p2 is at l1_1, not l1_2. So the plan should be:

13. Drive truck t1 from l1_2 to l1_1 (drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1)
14. Load p2 onto truck t1 at l1_1 (loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1)
15. Drive truck t1 from l1_1 to l1_4 (drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1)
16. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_4 (unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4)

Let's check the initial state again and track the whole plan:

Initial state:
- Package p1 is in location l1_1
- Package p2 is in location l2_5
- Truck t1 is in location l1_5
- Truck t2 is in location l2_4
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

For package p1 (from l1_1 to l1_2):
1. Move truck t1 from l1_5 to l1_1: t1 is now at l1_1.
2. Load p1 onto truck t1 at l1_1: p1 is now in t1, not at l1_1.
3. Drive truck t1 from l1_1 to l1_2: t1 (with p1) is now at l1_2.
4. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_2: p1 is now at l1_2, achieving the first goal.

For package p2 (from l2_5 to l1_4):
5. Drive truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_5: t2 is now at l2_5.
6. Load p2 onto truck t2 at l2_5: p2 is now in t2, not at l2_5.
7. Drive truck t2 from l2_5 to l2_4: t2 (with p2) is now at l2_4, satisfying the constraint.
8. Drive truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_1: t2 (with p2) is now at l2_1.
9. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1: p2 is now at l2_1.
10. Load p2 onto airplane a2 at l2_1: p2 is now in a2, not at l2_1.
11. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1: a2 (with p2) is now at l1_1.
12. Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1: p2 is now at l1_1.
13. Drive truck t1 from l1_2 to l1_1: t1 is now at l1_1.
14. Load p2 onto truck t1 at l1_1: p2 is now in t1, not at l1_1.
15. Drive truck t1 from l1_1 to l1_4: t1 (with p2) is now at l1_4.
16. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_4: p2 is now at l1_4, achieving the second goal.

The final plan is:

```
drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2
drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
```

Ah, I just realized there was an issue with my understanding of the initial state. I said:

> - Package p1 is in location l1_1
> - Package p2 is in location l2_5
> - Truck t1 is in location l1_5
> - Truck t2 is in location l2_4
> - Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
> - Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

But looking back at the problem statement:

```
"Package t1 is in location l1_5"
"Package t2 is in location l2_4"
"Package p1 is in location l1_1"
"Package p2 is in location l2_5"
"Package a1 is in location l1_1"
"Package a2 is in location l2_1"
```

It's labeling t1, t2, a1, and a2 as packages, which doesn't make sense since they're trucks and airplanes. Let me assume the intention was to describe the locations of trucks and airplanes, not to call them packages. Let me try to make sense of the problem definition:

- Package p1 is in location l1_1
- Package p2 is in location l2_5
- Truck t1 is in location l1_5
- Truck t2 is in location l2_4
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

Based on this corrected understanding, my plan remains the same.

I think I have a good plan now. Let's review everything again to be sure:

Initial state:
- Package p1 is in location l1_1
- Package p2 is in location l2_5
- Truck t1 is in location l1_5
- Truck t2 is in location l2_4
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

Goal:
- Package p1 is in location l1_2
- Package p2 is in location l1_4

Constraints:
1. "Package p2 is in location l2_5" must hold in at least one state.
2. If "Package p2 is in location l2_5" holds in some state s, then "Package p2 is in location l2_4" must hold at s or at some state after s.

Plan:
1. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
3. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 (p1 is now at l1_2, first goal achieved)
5. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2
6. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 (p2 is already at l2_5 in the initial state, which satisfies constraint 1)
7. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2 (p2 is now at l2_4, which satisfies constraint 2)
8. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
9. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
10. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
11. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
12. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
13. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
14. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
15. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
16. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (p2 is now at l1_4, second goal achieved)

Wait, I'm still a bit confused about constraint 1. It says "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'Package p2 is in location l2_5'". 

Given that p2 is initially in l2_5, this constraint is already satisfied in the initial state. But to be extra sure, let me analyze the constraints more carefully:

1. "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'Package p2 is in location l2_5'".
   - This means that at some point in our plan, p2 must be in l2_5.
   - Since p2 is already in l2_5 in the initial state, this constraint is already satisfied. We don't need to worry about moving it to l2_5.

2. "If expression 'Package p2 is in location l2_5' holds in some state s, then expression 'Package p2 is in location l2_4' must hold at s or at some state after s."
   - This means that after p2 is in l2_5, it must also be in l2_4 at some later point.
   - Since p2 is initially in l2_5, we need to make sure that at some point, p2 is in l2_4.

My plan does ensure that p2 moves from l2_5 to l2_4, so constraint 2 is satisfied.

Based on this understanding, I could optimize my plan. Since t2 is initially at l2_4 and p2 is at l2_5, I don't need to move t2 to l2_5. I only need to ensure p2 is at l2_4 at some point:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
3. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 (p1 is now at l1_2, first goal achieved)
5. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2
6. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
7. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2 (p2 is now at l2_4, which satisfies constraint 2)
8. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
9. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
10. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
11. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
12. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
13. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
14. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
15. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
16. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (p2 is now at l1_4, second goal achieved)

Actually, I think I've been overthinking the constraints. Let me one more time simplify them:

1. "Package p2 is in location l2_5" must hold in at least one state. Since p2 is already in l2_5 in the initial state, this constraint is already satisfied.
2. After p2 is in l2_5, it must also be in l2_4 at some point. Thus, we need to ensure p2 moves from l2_5 to l2_4.

My final plan is the 16-step plan I've written above, which satisfies all the goals and constraints.

Wait, let me double check the problem statement for the "loadairplane" and "unloadairplane" actions:

"loadairplane p ap l": Load package p in airplane ap. Both p and ap are in location l.
"unloadairplane p ap l": Unload package p from airplane ap in location l.

OK, so my plan is correct, I had the correct understanding of the actions.

The final plan is:
```
drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2
drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
```

With that, the plan is complete and will achieve the goal of having p1 in l1_2 and p2 in l1_4, while also satisfying the constraints that p2 must be in l2_5 at some point (which it already is in the initial state), and that after p2 is in l2_5, it must be in l2_4 at some point.
