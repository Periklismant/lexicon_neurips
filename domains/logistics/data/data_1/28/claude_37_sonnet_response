Let me analyze this planning problem step by step.

First, I'll understand what we have in the initial state:
- Two cities c1 and c2, each with 5 locations (including an airport)
- Locations l1_1 through l1_5 are in city c1, with l1_1 being the airport
- Locations l2_1 through l2_5 are in city c2, with l2_1 being the airport
- Two trucks (t1 and t2) located at l1_4 and l2_4 respectively
- Two airplanes (a1 and a2) located at l1_1 and l2_1 respectively
- Two packages (p1 and p2) located at l1_2 and l2_5 respectively

Our goal is to:
- Get package p1 to location l1_3
- Keep package p2 in location l2_5 (it's already there)

Additionally, there's a constraint that at some point in our plan:
- Either p2 is in location l2_3 OR p2 is in airplane a2

Let me think through this. Package p1 needs to move from l1_2 to l1_3, both within city c1. Package p2 starts at l2_5 and needs to end at l2_5 (the same location), but during the plan, it needs to either be in l2_3 or in airplane a2.

For p1, we need to:
1. Move truck t1 from l1_4 to l1_2 (where p1 is)
2. Load p1 into truck t1
3. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_3
4. Unload p1 at l1_3

For p2, since it needs to end up where it started (l2_5), but temporarily be either in l2_3 or airplane a2, we could:
Option 1:
1. Move truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_5 (where p2 is)
2. Load p2 into truck t2
3. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_3
4. Unload p2 at l2_3 (satisfying the constraint)
5. Load p2 back into truck t2
6. Drive t2 from l2_3 back to l2_5
7. Unload p2 at l2_5

Option 2:
1. Move truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_5 (where p2 is)
2. Load p2 into truck t2
3. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (the airport)
4. Unload p2 at l2_1
5. Load p2 into airplane a2 (satisfying the constraint)
6. Unload p2 from a2 at l2_1
7. Load p2 into truck t2
8. Drive t2 from l2_1 back to l2_5
9. Unload p2 at l2_5

Option 1 seems more efficient, so I'll go with that plan.

Let me formalize the complete plan:

For p1:
1. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
3. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3

For p2:
5. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2
6. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
7. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_3 c2
8. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
9. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
10. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2
11. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5

Wait, I just realized something confusing in the initial state. It says:
"Package t1 is in location l1_4"
"Package t2 is in location l2_4"
"Package p1 is in location l1_2"
"Package p2 is in location l2_5"
"Package a1 is in location l1_1"
"Package a2 is in location l2_1"

These descriptions call trucks (t1, t2) and airplanes (a1, a2) as "packages", which seems to be a mistake. These should be:
"Truck t1 is in location l1_4"
"Truck t2 is in location l2_4"
"Package p1 is in location l1_2"
"Package p2 is in location l2_5"
"Airplane a1 is in location l1_1"
"Airplane a2 is in location l2_1"

I'll assume this correction and proceed with my plan.

Let me review the plan once more to make sure it's valid:

For p1:
1. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1 
   - Moves truck t1 from its initial location to where p1 is
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 
   - Loads p1 into t1
3. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1 
   - Moves t1 with p1 to the goal location
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 
   - Unloads p1 at its goal location

For p2:
5. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2 
   - Moves truck t2 from its initial location to where p2 is
6. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 
   - Loads p2 into t2
7. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_3 c2 
   - Moves t2 with p2 to l2_3
8. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 
   - Unloads p2 at l2_3, satisfying the constraint
9. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 
   - Loads p2 back into t2
10. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2 
    - Moves t2 with p2 back to the goal location
11. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 
    - Unloads p2 at its goal location

This plan should satisfy all the requirements. Let me double-check:
- p1 ends up in l1_3
- p2 ends up in l2_5
- p2 is temporarily in l2_3, which satisfies the constraint
- All action preconditions are met

Actually, I can simplify this plan. Since p2 is already at its goal location (l2_5), and we just need it to be temporarily in l2_3 or in a2, we can:

For p2:
5. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2
6. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
7. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_3 c2
8. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (satisfying the constraint)
9. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
10. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2
11. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5

I could try using the airplane option, but it would require more steps:
5. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2
6. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
7. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
8. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
9. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (satisfying the constraint)
10. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
11. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
12. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
13. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5

So the truck-only option seems more efficient. 

Wait, there's a typo in the actions. Both "loadairplane" and the unload version are listed as "loadairplane". The second one should be "unloadairplane". I'll assume the correct version.

However, I just realized I might be misinterpreting the constraint. It says "The following expression must hold in at least one state" which means we just need p2 to be in l2_3 or in a2 at some point during execution.

Since p2 is already at l2_5, and the goal is to have it in l2_5, we just need to move it temporarily to satisfy the constraint and then move it back.

My plan is correct, and I believe it's also optimal. The combined plan is:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
3. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
5. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2
6. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
7. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_3 c2
8. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
9. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
10. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2
11. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5

This plan satisfies all requirements and constraints.

Upon further review, I realized that maybe we don't need to move p2 back to l2_5 if it's already there at the start, since the goal states that p2 should be in l2_5, which it already is. But the way I interpret the goal is that p2 should be in l2_5 *after* executing our plan, and the constraint is that at some point during the plan, p2 should be in l2_3 or in a2.

Since we have to satisfy the constraint (p2 in l2_3 or in a2 at some point), and we also need p2 to end up in l2_5, the plan has to involve moving p2 away from l2_5 and then back to it. My plan above does this in the most efficient way I can think of.

Let me check once more if there's a more efficient plan:

For p1, we need 4 steps as outlined above.

For p2, we need at minimum:
- Move truck t2 to p2
- Load p2 into t2
- Move t2 to l2_3
- Unload p2 at l2_3 (satisfying the constraint)
- Load p2 back into t2
- Move t2 back to l2_5
- Unload p2 at l2_5

That's 7 steps, and there's no way to reduce this while still satisfying the constraint. So the total plan has 11 steps, and I believe it's optimal.

Final plan:
1. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
3. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
5. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2
6. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
7. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_3 c2
8. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
9. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
10. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2
11. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
