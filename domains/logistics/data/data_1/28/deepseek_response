The plan first moves package p1 from l1_2 to l1_3 using truck t1 in city c1. This satisfies the main goal for p1. For package p2, while it already starts at the goal location l2_5, we temporarily move it to l2_3 using truck t2 to satisfy the constraint. The sequence loads p2, moves it to l2_3 (satisfying the constraint "Package p2 is in location l2_3"), then returns it to l2_5 to maintain the goal condition. The plan is optimal as it contains the minimal required actions to achieve both the goal and constraint.
