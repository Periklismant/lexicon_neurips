Let me understand the problem step by step:

We have a logistics planning problem where:
- The world has cities, locations, trucks, airplanes, and packages.
- Trucks can move between locations within the same city.
- Airplanes can move between airports (which are specific locations).
- Packages can be loaded onto and unloaded from trucks and airplanes.

The initial state is:
- Cities: c1 and c2
- Locations in c1: l1_1 (airport), l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5
- Locations in c2: l2_1 (airport), l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5
- Truck t1 is in location l1_4
- Truck t2 is in location l2_2
- Package p1 is in location l1_4
- Package p2 is in location l1_4
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (airport in city c1)
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1 (airport in city c2)

The goal is:
- Package p1 is in location l2_4
- Package p2 is in location l1_4

Wait, wait. Let me check the initial state again... there seems to be some oddity in how the initial state is described:

"Package t1 is in location l1_4"
"Package t2 is in location l2_2"
"Package p1 is in location l1_4"
"Package p2 is in location l1_4"
"Package a1 is in location l1_1"
"Package a2 is in location l2_1"

This doesn't seem right. t1 and t2 should be trucks, not packages, and a1 and a2 should be airplanes, not packages. Let me assume the correct initial state is:

- Truck t1 is in location l1_4
- Truck t2 is in location l2_2
- Package p1 is in location l1_4
- Package p2 is in location l1_4
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (airport in city c1)
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1 (airport in city c2)

With the constraints:
1. At some point, package p1 must be in location l2_1 (which is an airport in c2).
2. Before p1 can be in l2_1, p2 must be in location l1_2.

Let's analyze this further:

Initial state:
- p1 is in l1_4
- p2 is in l1_4

Constraints:
- At some point, p1 must be in l2_1
- Before p1 can be in l2_1, p2 must be in l1_2

Goal:
- p1 is in l2_4
- p2 is in l1_4

So, we need to follow these steps:
1. First, move p2 to l1_2 (to satisfy the constraint).
2. Then, we can move p1 to l2_1 (to satisfy the constraint).
3. Finally, move p1 to l2_4 (to reach the goal) and ensure p2 is back in l1_4 (also to reach the goal).

Let's write a plan for this:

1. To move p2 from l1_4 to l1_2:
   - We can use truck t1 which is already in l1_4. We'll load p2 onto t1, drive t1 to l1_2, then unload p2 there.

2. To move p1 from l1_4 to l2_1:
   - We'll use airplane a1. First, we need to move p1 to the airport l1_1. We can use truck t1 which is now in l1_2 (after dropping off p2). We'll drive t1 back to l1_4, load p1 onto t1, drive t1 to l1_1, unload p1, load p1 onto a1, fly a1 to l2_1, and then unload p1 there.

3. To move p1 from l2_1 to l2_4:
   - We can use truck t2 which is in l2_2. We'll drive t2 to l2_1, load p1 onto t2, drive t2 to l2_4, then unload p1 there.

4. To ensure p2 is back in l1_4:
   - We need to move p2 from l1_2 back to l1_4. We can use truck t1 which is now in l1_1. We'll drive t1 to l1_2, load p2 onto t1, drive t1 to l1_4, and then unload p2 there.

I'm going to write this out in more detail now.

Wait, actually there's an issue. We need to make sure p2 is in l1_2 before p1 is in l2_1, and p2 should end up in l1_4. Let me revise:

We need to:
1. Move p2 from l1_4 to l1_2 (to satisfy the constraint).
2. Move p1 from l1_4 to l2_1 (to satisfy the constraint; this can only happen after p2 is in l1_2).
3. Move p1 from l2_1 to l2_4 (to reach the goal).
4. Move p2 from l1_2 back to l1_4 (to reach the goal).

My plan above would still work, but I think I need to be more explicit about the order of operations.

Actually, wait. In the above description I found some issues. Let's clarify:

- p1 is initially at l1_4 and needs to end up at l2_4.
- p2 is initially at l1_4 and needs to end up at l1_4 (no movement needed).
- There are two constraints: p1 must pass through l2_1, and before that, p2 must pass through l1_2.

So we need:
1. Move p2 from l1_4 to l1_2.
2. Move p1 from l1_4 to l2_1.
3. Move p1 from l2_1 to l2_4.
4. Move p2 from l1_2 back to l1_4.

Now, let's figure out a detailed plan:

1. To move p2 from l1_4 to l1_2:
   - Load p2 onto truck t1 which is already in l1_4.
   - Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_2.
   - Unload p2 from t1 at l1_2.

2. To move p1 from l1_4 to l2_1:
   - Drive t1 from l1_2 back to l1_4.
   - Load p1 onto t1 at l1_4.
   - Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1 (the airport in c1).
   - Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1.
   - Load p1 onto airplane a1 at l1_1.
   - Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1 (the airport in c2).
   - Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1.

3. To move p1 from l2_1 to l2_4:
   - Drive truck t2 from l2_2 to l2_1.
   - Load p1 onto t2 at l2_1.
   - Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4.
   - Unload p1 from t2 at l2_4.

4. To move p2 from l1_2 back to l1_4:
   - Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_2.
   - Load p2 onto t1 at l1_2.
   - Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_4.
   - Unload p2 from t1 at l1_4.

Let's translate this into the required format:

```
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
```

Actually, wait. It never says p2 has to end up back in l1_4. Let me re-read the goal state:

"The following conditions are all true: "Package p1 is in location l2_4", "Package p2 is in location l1_4""

Yes, so p2 does need to end up back in l1_4. My plan above is correct.

Actually, wait, I just realized there's another issue. The problem statement says:

Before p1 can be in l2_1, p2 must be in l1_2.

The way I interpret this is: p2 must be in l1_2 at some point before we put p1 in l2_1. But it doesn't say p2 has to stay in l1_2. Maybe we can move p2 back to l1_4 before moving p1 to l2_1. Let me adjust my plan:

1. Move p2 from l1_4 to l1_2 (to satisfy the constraint).
2. Move p2 from l1_2 back to l1_4 (to work towards the goal).
3. Move p1 from l1_4 to l2_1 (to satisfy the constraint; this can only happen after p2 has been in l1_2).
4. Move p1 from l2_1 to l2_4 (to reach the goal).

This would be shorter. But wait, I should check one more time if the constraint actually allows this. The constraint states:

"If expression "Package p1 is in location l2_1" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: "Package p2 is in location l1_2""

So my interpretation seems right. p2 just needs to have been in l1_2 at some point before p1 is in l2_1. We can move p2 back to l1_4 before p1 reaches l2_1.

OK, wait, that would be silly actually. Let's stick with the above plan. I was overthinking.

A more streamlined plan would be:

1. Move p2 from l1_4 to l1_2 and back to l1_4 (to satisfy the constraint and the goal).
2. Move p1 from l1_4 to l2_1 (to satisfy the constraint; this can only happen after p2 has been in l1_2).
3. Move p1 from l2_1 to l2_4 (to reach the goal).

So:

1. To move p2 from l1_4 to l1_2 and back:
   - Load p2 onto truck t1 which is already in l1_4.
   - Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_2.
   - Unload p2 from t1 at l1_2.
   - Load p2 back onto t1 at l1_2.
   - Drive t1 from l1_2 back to l1_4.
   - Unload p2 from t1 at l1_4.

2. To move p1 from l1_4 to l2_1:
   - Load p1 onto t1 at l1_4.
   - Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1 (the airport in c1).
   - Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1.
   - Load p1 onto airplane a1 at l1_1.
   - Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1 (the airport in c2).
   - Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1.

3. To move p1 from l2_1 to l2_4:
   - Drive truck t2 from l2_2 to l2_1.
   - Load p1 onto t2 at l2_1.
   - Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4.
   - Unload p1 from t2 at l2_4.

Let's translate this into the required format:

```
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
```

Hmm, maybe there's a more efficient plan. Let's see if there's any way to reduce the number of actions.

Actually, I'm noticing a potential inefficiency:
1. We have both p1 and p2 start in the same location (l1_4).
2. We first move p2 to l1_2 and back to l1_4.
3. We then move p1 to l2_1 via l1_1 (the airport) and then to l2_4.

I'm wondering if there's a more efficient way to move p2 to l1_2 and back, possibly while p1 is on the way to l2_1. But it seems like the constraint forces us to have p2 in l1_2 before p1 is in l2_1, so we can't do them in parallel.

Okay I realized what I was thinking: we can get p2 to l1_2 and then get it back to l1_4 using different vehicles. Let's see:

1. To move p2 from l1_4 to l1_2:
   - Load p2 onto truck t1 which is already in l1_4.
   - Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_2.
   - Unload p2 from t1 at l1_2.

2. To move p1 from l1_4 to l2_1:
   - Drive t1 from l1_2 back to l1_4.
   - Load p1 onto t1 at l1_4.
   - Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1 (the airport in c1).
   - Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1.
   - Load p1 onto airplane a1 at l1_1.
   - Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1 (the airport in c2).
   - Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1.

3. To move p1 from l2_1 to l2_4:
   - Drive truck t2 from l2_2 to l2_1.
   - Load p1 onto t2 at l2_1.
   - Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4.
   - Unload p1 from t2 at l2_4.

4. To move p2 from l1_2 back to l1_4:
   - Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_2.
   - Load p2 onto t1 at l1_2.
   - Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_4.
   - Unload p2 from t1 at l1_4.

OK so this plan doesn't change anything. Hmm. OK let me try a different approach:

1. For p2:
   - Drive truck t1 from l1_4 to l1_2 (with p2).
   - Unload p2 at l1_2.
   - Drive t1 back to l1_4.

2. For p1:
   - Fly airplane a1 from l1_1 to l1_4.
   - Load p1 onto a1 at l1_4.
   - Fly a1 to l2_1.
   - Unload p1 at l2_1.
   - Drive truck t2 from l2_2 to l2_1, load p1, drive to l2_4, and unload.

3. For p2 (part 2):
   - Fly a1 from l2_1 back to l1_2.
   - Load p2 onto a1 at l1_2.
   - Fly a1 to l1_4.
   - Unload p2 at l1_4.

But wait, we can't fly an airplane to l1_4 or l1_2, since those aren't airports. So I think the first plan is the right one.

Actually, wait - the shortest way to get package p1 from l1_4 to l2_4 is:

1. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_4.
2. Drive t1a from l1_4 to the airport l1_1.
3. Unload p1 from t1 at airport l1_1.
4. Load p1 onto a1 at airport l1_1.
5. Fly a1 from airport l1_1 to airport l2_1.
6. Unload p1 from a1 at airport l2_1.
7. Load p1 onto t2 at airport l2_1.
8. Drive t2 from airport l2_1 to l2_4.
9. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_4.

And the shortest way to get package p2 from l1_4 to l1_2 and back to l1_4 is:

1. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_4.
2. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_2.
3. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_2.
4. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_2.
5. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_4.
6. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_4.

Because of the constraint (p2 must be in l1_2 before p1 is in l2_1), we have to execute the p2 plan before the p1 plan. So our overall plan is:

1. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_4.
2. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_2.
3. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_2.
4. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_2.
5. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_4.
6. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_4.
7. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_4.
8. Drive t1 from l1_4 to the airport l1_1.
9. Unload p1 from t1 at airport l1_1.
10. Load p1 onto a1 at airport l1_1.
11. Fly a1 from airport l1_1 to airport l2_1.
12. Unload p1 from a1 at airport l2_1.
13. Drive t2 from l2_2 to airport l2_1.
14. Load p1 onto t2 at airport l2_1.
15. Drive t2 from airport l2_1 to l2_4.
16. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_4.

Let's translate this into the required format:

```
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
```

Actually, that's the same plan as before. Hmm, I think this is the shortest/most optimal plan based on the constraints we have.

Actually, maybe there's a cleverer move with the p2 constraint. What if we:

1. Put p2 in l1_2
2. Immediately put p1 in l1_1 (but not yet in l2_1)
3. Put p2 back in l1_4
4. Move p1 to l2_1 and onward

I think this wouldn't work because the constraint specifies that p2 must be in l1_2 at a point in time before p1 is in l2_1.

Actually, I think there's one improvement we can make!

We can cut down on one loading and one unloading of p2 by not bringing p2 back to l1_4 first. Instead, we can move it to l1_4 later after p1 is on its way:

1. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_4.
2. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_2.
3. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_2.
4. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_4.
5. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_4.
6. Drive t1 from l1_4 to the airport l1_1.
7. Unload p1 from t1 at airport l1_1.
8. Load p1 onto a1 at airport l1_1.
9. Fly a1 from airport l1_1 to airport l2_1.
10. Unload p1 from a1 at airport l2_1.
11. Drive t1 from airport l1_1 to l1_2.
12. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_2.
13. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_4.
14. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_4.
15. Drive t2 from l2_2 to airport l2_1.
16. Load p1 onto t2 at airport l2_1.
17. Drive t2 from airport l2_1 to l2_4.
18. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_4.

That's 16 steps, one less than before.

Let's translate this into the required format:

```
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
```

Hmm but let me count again:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1
3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
4. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1
5. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
6. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
7. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
8. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
9. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
10. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
11. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
12. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
13. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1
14. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
15. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
16. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
17. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
18. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

That's 18 steps. I think I miscounted earlier.

Wait, sorry, I just realized the original plan was:
```
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
```

That's 16 steps.

My second approach had these steps:
```
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
```

That's 18 steps. So in fact, the original plan is more optimal.

OK we have a plan and it is:

```
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
```

Wait, let's do a final review:

1. p1 is initially at l1_4 and needs to end up at l2_4.
2. p2 is initially at l1_4 and needs to end up at l1_4 (no movement needed).
3. Constraints: p1 must pass through l2_1, and before that, p2 must pass through l1_2.

I think the plan we made satisfies all of these:

- p2 starts in l1_4, goes to l1_2, and then back to l1_4.
- Only after p2 is in l1_2 does p1 move towards l2_1.
- p1 passes through l2_1 as required by the constraint.
- p1 ends up in l2_4 as required.
- p2 ends up in l1_4 as required.

Are there any other ways to optimize this plan?

wait, actually is there a way to use both trucks at the same time? Let's see:

1. Use t1 to move p2 to l1_2.
2. Use t1 to move p1 to the airport.
3. Use airplane a1 to move p1 to airport l2_1 in c2.
4. Use t2 to move p1 to l2_4.
5. Use t1 to move p2 back to l1_4.

I think this plan is the same, because p2 needs to be at l1_2 before p1 is at l2_1, and both p1 and p2 start at l1_4, so we can't work in parallel.

OK are there any issues with our plan? Let me do one final review:

1. We load p2 onto t1 at l1_4.
2. We drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_2, placing p2 in l1_2 (satisfying the first part of the constraint, that p2 must be in l1_2 before p1 is in l2_1).
3. We unload p2 from t1 at l1_2.
4. We load p2 back onto t1 at l1_2.
5. We drive t1 from l1_2 back to l1_4.
6. We unload p2 from t1 at l1_4.
7. We load p1 onto t1 at l1_4.
8. We drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1 (the airport in c1).
9. We unload p1 from t1 at l1_1.
10. We load p1 onto airplane a1 at l1_1.
11. We fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1 (the airport in c2).
12. We unload p1 from a1 at l2_1 (satisfying the second part of the constraint, that p1 must be in l2_1 at some point).
13. We drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1.
14. We load p1 onto t2 at l2_1.
15. We drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4.
16. We unload p1 from t2 at l2_4.

This leaves:
- p1 in l2_4 (goal state)
- p2 in l1_4 (goal state)

Yep everything checks out, so our final plan is:

```
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
```

Actually, I want to make sure I read the constraints correctly:

```
"The following expression must hold in at least one state: "Package p1 is in location l2_1""
"If expression "Package p1 is in location l2_1" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: "Package p2 is in location l1_2""
```

Yeah that's as I thought:
1. p1 must be in l2_1 at some point.
2. Before p1 is in l2_1, p2 must be in l1_2.

And our plan fulfills both of these.

One last sanity check:
- We're trying to get package p1 from l1_4 to l2_4.
- We're trying to get package p2 from l1_4 to l1_4 (so we need to move it, but then bring it back).

Our plan moves p2 from l1_4 to l1_2 and back to l1_4. Then it moves p1 from l1_4 to l2_4, with a stop at l2_1 in between. So yes, we're good!
