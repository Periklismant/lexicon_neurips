Let me clarify the problem by organizing the data:

**Objects:**
- Locations for city c1: l1_1 (airport), l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5, l1_6, l1_7, l1_8
- Locations for city c2: l2_1 (airport), l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5, l2_6, l2_7, l2_8
- Cities: c1, c2
- Packages: p1, p2
- Trucks: t1, t2
- Airplanes: a1, a2

**Initial State:**
- t1 is in location l1_1
- t2 is in location l2_4
- p1 is in location l1_7
- p2 is in location l2_1
- a1 is in location l1_1
- a2 is in location l2_1

**Goal:**
- p1 is in location l1_1
- p2 is in location l1_2

**Constraints:**
1. "Package p2 is in a2" must hold in at least one state.
2. If "Package p2 is in a2" holds in some state s, then "Package p1 is in a1" must hold at s or at some state after s.

Wait, I think there's a confusion in the initial state. It says "Package t1", "Package t2", etc. but t1 and t2 are trucks, not packages. Let me reinterpret:

**Initial State (Corrected):**
- Truck t1 is in location l1_1
- Truck t2 is in location l2_4
- Package p1 is in location l1_7
- Package p2 is in location l2_1
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

Now let's think about the plan:

**Goal State:**
- Package p1 is in location l1_1
- Package p2 is in location l1_2

To satisfy the constraints:
1. p2 must be loaded into a2 at some point.
2. When p2 is in a2, p1 must be in a1 at the same time or later.

Let's devise a plan:

1. Need to get p1 from l1_7 to l1_1:
   - Drive truck t1 from l1_1 to l1_7
   - Load p1 onto t1 at l1_7
   - Drive t1 back to l1_1
   - Load p1 onto a1 at l1_1 (to satisfy constraint 2)
   - Unload p1 from a1 at l1_1 (to reach the goal)

2. Need to get p2 from l2_1 to l1_2:
   - Load p2 onto a2 at l2_1 (to satisfy constraint 1)
   - Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1
   - Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1
   - Load p2 onto t1 at l1_1
   - Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_2
   - Unload p2 from t1 at l1_2

Let me sequence these actions to ensure constraints are met:

**Plan:**
1. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_7 c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_7
3. drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_1 c1
4. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (This is when "Package p2 is in a2" holds)
5. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (Satisfying constraint 2)
6. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
7. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
8. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
9. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
10. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
11. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

Let me check:
Wait, there's an issue. I tried to load p1 onto a1 after it's already on t1. Let me revise:

**Revised Plan:**
1. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_7 c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_7
3. drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_1 c1
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
5. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (To satisfy constraint 2)
6. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (This is when "Package p2 is in a2" holds)
7. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (To reach the goal for p1)
8. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
9. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
10. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
11. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
12. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

Wait, let me reconsider the constraint again. It says if "Package p2 is in a2" holds in some state s, then "Package p1 is in a1" must hold at s or at some state after s. So, the loading of p1 into a1 can occur at the same time as the loading of p2 into a2, or after.

Let me check the sequence again:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_7 c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_7
3. drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_1 c1
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
5. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (This is when "Package p2 is in a2" holds)
6. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (Satisfying constraint 2)
7. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (To reach the goal for p1)
8. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
9. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
10. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
11. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
12. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

But there's a more efficiant way to do this. Since we need to have p1 loaded into a1 at some point, and we also need to have p1 in l1_1 in the end, we can simply load p1 onto a1 and then unload it at l1_1. Similarly, we need to have p2 loaded into a2 and ultimately in l1_2. We can use the trucks to get the packages to the airports, fly the planes, and then use the trucks again to get p2 to l1_2.

Let's revise again:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_7 c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_7
3. drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_1 c1
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
5. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (Satisfying constraint 2)
6. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (This is when "Package p2 is in a2" holds)
7. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
8. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (To reach the goal for p1)
9. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
10. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
11. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
12. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

In fact, steps 5-6 can be done in parallel. So can steps 8-9. But since we need to provide a linear plan, I've listed them sequentially.

But wait, step 6 won't satisfy the constraint because p2 is already loaded into a2 before p1 is loaded into a1. Let me reorder:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_7 c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_7
3. drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_1 c1
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
5. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (Done first, to ensure constraint 2 is met)
6. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (Now "Package p2 is in a2" holds)
7. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
8. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (To reach the goal for p1)
9. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
10. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
11. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
12. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

Hold on, there's a mis-reading. The constraint is that if p2 is in a2 at some state s, then p1 must be in a1 at that state or a future state. It doesn't necessarily mean p1 must be loaded onto a1 before p2 is loaded onto a2. In fact, the timing of when they're loaded doesn't matter; what matters is the relationship between the states where p2 is in a2 and p1 is in a1.

So, let me reconsider:
After loading p2 into a2, at some point, we need to ensure p1 is in a1. This is to satisfy the constraint that if p2 is in a2 at state s, then p1 must be in a1 at state s or at a state after s.

However, I'm ignoring the fact that p2 will continue to be in a2 until it's unloaded. So, if we load p2 into a2 at step 6, this condition persists until we unload it. Therefore, p1 must be in a1 at some point between when p2 is loaded into a2 and when it's unloaded. I've ensured this by loading p1 into a1 at step 5, before p2 is loaded into a2, but this means that p1 is in a1 concurrently with p2 being in a2, which satisfies the constraint.

Actually, let me fix this one more time. I've been underspecifying the actions. Let's be fully precise:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_7 c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_7
3. drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_1 c1
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
5. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
6. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
7. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
8. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
9. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
10. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
11. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
12. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

Let me ensure once more that the constraints are satisfied:

1. Constraint 1: "Package p2 is in a2" must hold in at least one state. This is satisfied at steps 6-9.
2. Constraint 2: If "Package p2 is in a2" holds in some state s, then "Package p1 is in a1" must hold at s or at some state after s. At step 6, p2 is loaded into a2. At step 5 (before), p1 is loaded into a1, and remains there until step 8. So, during steps 6-7, both p2 is in a2 and p1 is in a1, which satisfies this constraint.

But looking at this again, I messed up. Let me verify the initial state once more.

**Initial State (Corrected):**
- Truck t1 is in location l1_1
- Truck t2 is in location l2_4
- Package p1 is in location l1_7
- Package p2 is in location l2_1
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

**Goal State:**
- Package p1 is in location l1_1
- Package p2 is in location l1_2

And here's the plan:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_7 c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_7
3. drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_1 c1
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (direct goal, not loading into airplane)
5. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (to satisfy constraint 2)
6. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (to satisfy constraint 1)
7. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
8. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
9. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
10. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
11. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
12. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

Let me adjust the ordering slightly:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_7 c1 (Moves t1 to where p1 is)
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_7 (Loads p1 onto t1)
3. drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_1 c1 (Moves t1 back to l1_1 with p1)
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (Places p1 at l1_1, satisfying part of the goal)
5. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (Loads p1 into a1, temporarily)
6. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (Loads p2 into a2, as required by constraint 1)
7. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (Unloads p1 back at l1_1, ensuring it's at the goal)
8. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (Flies a2 with p2 to l1_1)
9. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (Unloads p2 at l1_1)
10. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (Loads p2 onto t1)
11. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1 (Moves t1 to l1_2 with p2)
12. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (Places p2 at l1_2, satisfying the remaining part of the goal)

This plan seems to meet the goals and constraints, but it feels like there are steps that could be optimized or eliminated. Let me think again.

Actually, the plan as stated has a redundant step. After we unload p1 to reach the goal (step 4), we don't actually need to load it into a1 and then unload it again (steps 5 and 7). We've already achieved the goal for p1. But loading p1 into a1 is necessary to satisfy constraint 2, which says that if p2 is in a2, then p1 must be in a1 at that state or at a state after it.

But wait, the constraint is tricky. It says if p2 is in a2, then p1 must be in a1 at the same time or later. This means p1 must be in a1 during or after the time p2 is in a2.

Let's adjust our plan:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_7 c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_7
3. drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_1 c1
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
5. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (p2 is now in a2, satisfying constraint 1)
6. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (p1 is now in a1, satisfying constraint 2)
7. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (p1's goal is maintained)
8. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
9. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
10. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
11. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
12. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (p2's goal is met)

Hmm, but maybe "must hold at s or at some state after s" means I only need to have p1 in a1 after p2 is in a2. Since p2 is in a2 at step 5, I could have p1 in a1 at step 6.

I am a bit unsure, so let me optimize the plan on the assumption that it's safer to have p1 in a1 concurrently with p2 in a2.

Actually, I'm overcomplicating this. Let me reread the constraint: If "Package p2 is in a2" holds in some state s, then "Package p1 is in a1" must hold at s or at some state after s.

This means that from the point p2 gets into a2, at that time or later, p1 must be in a1 for at least one state. So, as long as we have p1 in a1 after or during the time p2 is in a2, we're fine.

Let's continue with the plan as outlined, keeping steps 5-7. This way, we ensure that there's a state (after step 6 but before step 7) where p2 is in a2 and p1 is in a1, which satisfies the constraint.

Here's our plan:
1. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_7 c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_7
3. drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_1 c1
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
5. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (p2 is now in a2, satisfying constraint 1)
6. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (p1 is now in a1, satisfying constraint 2)
7. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (p1's goal is maintained)
8. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
9. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
10. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
11. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
12. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (p2's goal is met)

I believe this plan meets the goals and constraints. It ensures:
- p1 ends up at l1_1
- p2 ends up at l1_2
- p2 is in a2 at some point
- When p2 is in a2, p1 is in a1 (or gets into a1 later, but in this case, it's concurrent)

Just to double check:

**Goal State:**
- Package p1 is in location l1_1 ✓ (achieved at steps 4, 7, and maintained)
- Package p2 is in location l1_2 ✓ (achieved at step 12)

**Constraints:**
1. "Package p2 is in a2" must hold in at least one state. ✓ (satisfied at steps 5-9)
2. If "Package p2 is in a2" holds in some state s, then "Package p1 is in a1" must hold at s or at some state after s. ✓ (satisfied at step 6, which is after step 5)

One technical error in the above: the "loadtruck" should be "loadtruck p1 t1 l1_7", and similarly there are other full actions I elided above when reasoning. Let me double check that all the action parameters are fully specified in my plan:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_7 c1 ✓
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_7 ✓
3. drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_1 c1 ✓
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 ✓
5. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 ✓
6. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 ✓
7. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 ✓
8. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 ✓
9. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 ✓
10. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 ✓
11. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1 ✓
12. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 ✓

Ah, I'm actually seeing a potential issue. One of the action definitions was "loadairplane p ap l", but another was "loadairplane p ap l". Let me refer back to the description to see which one is the unload action.

From the description: "unloadairplane p ap l" is the action to unload a package from an airplane. Steps 7 and 9 should use "unloadairplane".

Let me fix that:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_7 c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_7
3. drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_1 c1
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
5. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
6. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
7. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
8. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
9. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
10. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
11. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
12. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

This looks correct. It satisfies the goals and constraints, and all the action parameters are fully specified.

Actually, looking at the domain description again:

```
"unloadtruck p t l": Unload package p from truck t in location l.
"loadairplane p ap l": Unload package p from airplane ap in location l.
```

The unload action for the airplane is still listed as "loadairplane". I'll assume this is a typo and that it should be "unloadairplane", as used in the preconditions and effects sections.

Let's finalize the plan:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_7 c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_7
3. drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_1 c1
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
5. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
6. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
7. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
8. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
9. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
10. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
11. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
12. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

This is the optimized and correct plan that satisfies the goals and constraints.

Actually, let's try one last time. There's a confusingly specified action in the domain:

```
"loadairplane p ap l": Load package p in airplane ap. Both p and ap are in location l.
"loadairplane p ap l": Unload package p from airplane ap in location l.
```

This can't be right; the same action name can't have two definitions. But later in the message it says:

```
"unloadairplane": After unloading a package p from an airplane ap in a location l, (i) p is no longer in ap, and (ii) p is situated in l.
```

So I'll assume the second "loadairplane" should actually be "unloadairplane". With that, our plan is:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_7 c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_7
3. drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_1 c1
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
5. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
6. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
7. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
8. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
9. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
10. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
11. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
12. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

This is the plan that satisfies the goals and constraints.
