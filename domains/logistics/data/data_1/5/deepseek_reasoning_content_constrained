Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. First, I need to understand the initial state and the goal. The goal is to have package p1 in l1_1 and p2 in l1_2. Let's look at where they start.

Initial state:
- p1 is in l1_7 (city c1)
- p2 is in l2_1 (city c2, which is an airport since l2_1 is listed as an airport)
- Trucks t1 is in l1_1 (c1's airport), t2 in l2_4 (c2)
- Airplanes a1 in l1_1 (c1's airport), a2 in l2_1 (c2's airport)

Constraints:
1. At some state, p2 must be in a2.
2. If p2 is in a2 in some state, then p1 must be in a1 either at that state or later.

So, first, need to get p2 into a2. Since p2 is in l2_1 (an airport), and a2 is in l2_1 initially. So maybe load p2 into a2 at l2_1. Then fly a2 to c1's airport (l1_1), unload p2, then use truck t1 (which is at l1_1) to drive p2 to l1_2. But wait, l1_2 is in c1. So after unloading p2 at l1_1, use t1 to drive to l1_2 and unload there.

But wait, the truck can only move within the same city. So t1 is in c1, so driving from l1_1 to l1_2 is possible.

For p1: it's in l1_7 (c1). Need to get it to l1_1. Since t1 is in l1_1, but p1 is in l1_7. So maybe use t1 to drive to l1_7, load p1 into t1, drive back to l1_1, unload. But let's check the initial positions. Wait, t1 is initially at l1_1. So steps for p1: drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_7, load p1 into t1, drive back to l1_1, unload. That would work. But maybe there's a way to involve airplanes if needed for constraints.

Wait, the constraints require that when p2 is in a2 (which will happen when we load it into a2 in l2_1), then p1 must be in a1 either at that state or later. So after loading p2 into a2, we need to ensure that p1 is in a1 at some point. So perhaps, after moving p2 via a2, we need to also get p1 into a1. But p1 is in c1. So maybe load p1 into a1 at l1_1, then unload it again. But why? Because the constraint is that if p2 is in a2 in some state, then p1 must be in a1 in that state or later. So we need to have p1 in a1 at some point after p2 is in a2.

Wait, the constraint is: if p2 is in a2 in state s, then p1 is in a1 in s or some state after s. So the earliest state where p2 is in a2 is when we load it into a2 in l2_1. So after that, p1 must be in a1 at some point. So how can we get p1 into a1? p1 is in l1_7. a1 is in l1_1. So maybe use the truck to bring p1 to l1_1, then load it into a1. But the plan is to get p1 to l1_1 anyway. So after unloading p1 in l1_1 via the truck, perhaps load it into a1 (but then we have to unload again to get it to l1_1). Wait, that would complicate things. Alternatively, maybe after moving p1 to l1_1 via the truck, we can load it into a1 and then immediately unload it. That way, the condition is satisfied: after p2 is in a2 (during the load), then later p1 is in a1 (when we load it into a1 and then unload). But is that necessary?

Let me outline the steps:

For p2:
1. Load p2 into a2 at l2_1 (since both are there initially)
   - This satisfies the first constraint that p2 is in a2 in some state.
   - Then, fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1 (since l1_1 is an airport in c1)
   - Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1
   - Then use truck t1 (which is at l1_1) to drive to l1_2 (same city c1), unload p2 there.

For p1:
- p1 is in l1_7 (c1). Truck t1 starts at l1_1. So steps:
   - Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_7
   - Load p1 into t1 at l1_7
   - Drive t1 back to l1_1
   - Unload p1 at l1_1

But during this process, after loading p2 into a2 (step 1), we need p1 to be in a1 at some point. However, in the above plan for p1, we are using the truck, not the airplane. So we need to ensure that after the load of p2 into a2, p1 is loaded into a1. How?

Wait, maybe after moving p1 to l1_1 via the truck, we can load it into a1 (which is at l1_1), then unload it again. That would satisfy the condition. Because the loading into a1 would be after the loading of p2 into a2.

So here's the plan:

For p2:
1. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
2. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
3. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
4. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
5. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (Wait, no. After unloading p2 from a2 at l1_1, we need to load it into t1, then drive t1 to l1_2 and unload. So step 4 should be loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1, then drive to l1_2, then unload. But wait, after unloading from a2 at l1_1, p2 is in l1_1. Then, t1 is at l1_1 (since step 4 is drivetruck, but t1 starts at l1_1). Wait, the initial state says "Package t1 is in location l1_1" â€” wait, that must be a typo. Wait the original state says:

Wait, the original state lists:

"Package t1 is in location l1_1"

Wait, but t1 is a truck. So that's a mistake. Probably, the correct initial state is "Truck t1 is in location l1_1". Similarly for others. Because the user wrote "Package t1 is in location l1_1", but t1 is a truck, not a package. This must be an error. Let me check the problem description again.

Looking back: The original state includes:

"Package t1 is in location l1_1"

"Package t2 is in location l2_4"

"Package p1 is in location l1_7"

"Package p2 is in location l2_1"

"Package a1 is in location l1_1"

"Package a2 is in location l2_1"

Wait, that can't be right. Because t1 is a truck, a1 is an airplane. So this is a mistake in the problem statement. The user probably intended:

"Truck t1 is in location l1_1"

"Truck t2 is in location l2_4"

"Airplane a1 is in location l1_1"

"Airplane a2 is in location l2_1"

But the problem states "Package t1", which is incorrect. This is a critical error. Because if t1 is a package, then we can't drive it. But given the context, the user must have meant that the trucks and airplanes are in those locations. So we have to assume that the original state is:

Truck t1 is at l1_1.

Truck t2 is at l2_4.

Airplane a1 is at l1_1.

Airplane a2 is at l2_1.

Packages p1 at l1_7, p2 at l2_1.

So assuming that, proceed.

So initial positions:

t1 (truck) in l1_1 (c1)

t2 (truck) in l2_4 (c2)

a1 (airplane) in l1_1 (c1's airport)

a2 (airplane) in l2_1 (c2's airport)

p1 in l1_7 (c1)

p2 in l2_1 (c2's airport)

So for p2:

Since p2 is in l2_1 (same as a2's location), we can load p2 into a2.

Then fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1 (c1's airport).

Then unload p2 from a2 into l1_1.

Then, to get p2 to l1_2 (c1), we need to use truck t1, which is in l1_1.

So load p2 into t1 at l1_1, drive t1 to l1_2, unload.

For p1:

p1 is in l1_7 (c1). Truck t1 is initially at l1_1. So we need to drive t1 to l1_7, load p1, drive back to l1_1, unload.

But then, we need to ensure that after p2 is in a2 (which happens when we load it into a2), p1 is in a1 at some point. So after loading p2 into a2, we need to have p1 in a1. So perhaps, after moving p1 to l1_1 via truck, we load it into a1 (which is at l1_1), then unload it again. That way, the constraint is met.

So steps for p1:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_7 c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_7
3. drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_1 c1
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
5. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
6. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

But steps 5 and 6 would make p1 end up back in l1_1, which is the goal. But why do we need to load and unload into a1? Because the constraint says that if p2 is in a2 (step 1 for p2), then p1 must be in a1 at that state or later. So after step 1 (loading p2 into a2), we have to have p1 in a1 at some point. So in the p1 steps, after step 4 (unloadtruck p1 at l1_1), we can load it into a1 (step 5), then unload (step6). This ensures that after the load of p2 into a2 (step1), p1 is loaded into a1 (step5), which is after.

But maybe the order of actions matters. Let's outline the entire plan with both packages.

Plan steps:

For p2:

1. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (p2 is now in a2, satisfying the first constraint)
2. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
3. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (p2 in l1_1)
4. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
5. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
6. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (p2 now at l1_2, goal achieved)

For p1:

7. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_7 c1 (after step6, t1 is at l1_2. Wait, but step5 moves t1 to l1_2, then step6 unloads p2 there. Then step7 would require t1 to be at l1_2. Wait, no. The steps must be interleaved.

Wait, the problem is that the truck t1 is used for both p2 and p1. Let's think about the order.

Wait, after step5 (drivetruck t1 to l1_2), the truck is there. Then step6 unloads p2. Then to use t1 for p1, we need to drive it back to l1_1, then to l1_7. But that's adding steps. Alternatively, maybe handle p1 first.

Alternatively, maybe the order should be:

Handle p1 first:

1. For p1:

a. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_7 (c1)
b. Load p1 into t1
c. Drive back to l1_1
d. Unload p1 into l1_1
e. Load into a1
f. Unload from a1 into l1_1 (this meets the constraint)

Then handle p2:

But then, when p2 is loaded into a2 (step after p1's steps), the constraint would require p1 to be in a1. But if p1 is already unloaded from a1, then that's not the case. So maybe the steps need to be ordered such that after loading p2 into a2 (which triggers the constraint), we ensure p1 is loaded into a1 later.

Alternatively, interleave the steps.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let's outline the entire sequence step by step.

The correct approach is to first handle the constraint. Let's see:

- The first constraint is that at some state, p2 must be in a2. So we need to load p2 into a2. This will be step 1: loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1.

- Then, the second constraint is that if p2 is in a2 in state s (which is step1), then in s or a subsequent state, p1 must be in a1. So after step1, we need to have p1 in a1 at some point.

So, after loading p2 into a2, we can fly a2 to l1_1, but before that, perhaps handle p1's loading into a1.

But p1 is in l1_7. How to get it into a1.

a1 is in l1_1. So steps for p1:

- Drive truck t1 (which is at l1_1) to l1_7.

- Load p1 into t1.

- Drive t1 back to l1_1.

- Unload p1 into l1_1.

- Then load p1 into a1 (now in l1_1).

- Then unload p1 from a1 back to l1_1.

This way, after step1 (loading p2 into a2), we have step5 (loading p1 into a1), satisfying the constraint.

But the steps would be:

1. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (p2 in a2, constraint met)
2. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (a2 now in l1_1)
3. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (p2 in l1_1)
4. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
5. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
6. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (p2 done)
7. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 (returning t1 to l1_1)
8. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_7 c1
9. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_7
10. drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_1 c1
11. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (p1 in l1_1)
12. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (p1 in a1)
13. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (p1 back to l1_1)

But this would result in p1 being in l1_1, which is the goal. However, steps 12 and 13 are unnecessary unless required by the constraint. But the constraint requires that after p2 is in a2 (step1), p1 must be in a1 at some state. So steps 12 (load into a1) meets that. Then step13 unloads, but the goal is already achieved.

But wait, the goal requires p1 to be in l1_1, which is achieved in step11. So steps 12 and 13 are redundant. However, to satisfy the constraint, after step1 (p2 in a2), we need to have p1 in a1 at some point. So after step1, steps 12 and 13 would do that. But in this sequence, step12 is after step11. But step1 is the first action. So steps for p1's loading into a1 would need to be after step1.

But in the current sequence, steps for p1's loading into a1 are steps12-13, which are after step1, so that's okay.

But maybe there's a more optimal way. Let's see.

Alternative approach:

After step1 (load p2 into a2), we can immediately start handling p1's loading into a1.

But p1 is in l1_7. To get it into a1, which is in l1_1.

So steps for p1:

a. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_7 (drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_7 c1)

b. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_7

c. Drive back to l1_1 (drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_1 c1)

d. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (p1 now at l1_1, which is the goal)

e. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (now p1 in a1)

f. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (p1 back to l1_1)

So steps e and f are only to satisfy the constraint that after p2 is in a2 (step1), p1 is in a1 at some point. But steps e and f can be done after step1.

So the plan would be:

1. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (satisfy first constraint)
2. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
3. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
4. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
5. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
6. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (p2 done)
7. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 (return t1 to l1_1)
8. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_7 c1
9. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_7
10. drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_1 c1
11. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (p1 at goal)
12. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (now p1 in a1)
13. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (p1 back to l1_1)

But steps 12 and 13 are redundant for the goal but needed for the constraint. Because after step1, the constraint requires p1 to be in a1 at some point. Steps 12 and 13 achieve that. But the problem is that step12 happens after step1, which is okay. However, this makes the plan longer. Is there a way to have p1 loaded into a1 earlier?

Alternative idea: While handling p1's movement, load it into a1 before moving it via truck. But that's not possible because a1 is in l1_1, and p1 is in l1_7. So the truck is needed to bring it to l1_1 first.

Alternatively, maybe after moving p1 to l1_1 via truck (step10 and 11), then load into a1 (step12), then unload (step13). But steps12-13 are necessary to satisfy the constraint. So those steps must be included.

But the problem asks for an optimal plan with minimal steps. So can we avoid steps12-13?

Wait, the constraint is that if p2 is in a2 in some state s, then p1 must be in a1 in s or after. So after step1 (s is step1), in that state, p1 is still in l1_7. So we need to have p1 in a1 in some state after step1.

The earliest possible is to load p1 into a1 after step1. But how? Because p1 is in l1_7. So steps:

After step1, fly a2 to l1_1, unload p2, then use t1 to get p1 to l1_1, then load into a1.

But the steps would be:

1. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (p2 in a2)
2. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
3. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (p2 in l1_1)
4. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
5. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
6. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (p2 done)
7. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_7 c1 (drive to l1_7)
8. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_7
9. drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_1 c1
10. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (p1 at goal)
11. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (now p1 in a1)
12. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

This way, after step1, we eventually get to step11 where p1 is in a1, satisfying the constraint. So steps11 and 12 are needed.

But the question is, can we find a shorter plan?

Alternative approach: Combine steps for p1 and p2. For example, after loading p2 into a2 and flying to l1_1, handle both packages.

But the key is that the constraint requires p1 to be in a1 after p2 is in a2. So let's see:

Plan steps:

1. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (p2 in a2)
   - Now, need to have p1 in a1 later.

2. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (a2 arrives l1_1)

3. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (p2 in l1_1)

4. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (t1 here)

5. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1

6. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (p2 done)

Meanwhile, for p1:

7. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_7 c1 (after step6, t1 is at l1_2. To get to l1_7, needs to drive through c1's locations. Assuming cities are connected, which they are as per the problem's locations. So drive from l1_2 to l1_7. But is that allowed? The drivetruck action allows moving between any locations in the same city. So yes.

But the initial position of t1 is l1_1. After step5, it's at l1_2. Step7 is drivetruck from l1_2 to l1_7. Then step8 load p1 into t1.

But after unloading p2 at l1_2 (step6), t1 is at l1_2.

So steps:

7. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_7 c1

8. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_7

9. drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_1 c1

10. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (p1 at goal)

11. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

12. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

This sequence has 12 steps. But maybe there's a way to optimize further.

Wait, after step10, p1 is at l1_1, which is the goal. So steps11 and 12 are unnecessary unless required by the constraint. The constraint is that whenever p2 is in a2 (which is step1), then p1 must be in a1 at that state or later. So in this plan, after step1, we have step11 (loading p1 into a1), which is after step1. So that satisfies the constraint.

But can we do step11 earlier? For example, after step10, p1 is at l1_1. So step11 can be done after step10, which is necessary for the constraint.

But the plan must include these steps. So the total steps would be 12. But maybe there's a shorter way.

Alternative idea: After step10, p1 is at l1_1. Then, load into a1 (step11) and unload (step12). But maybe we can load p1 into a1 immediately after bringing it to l1_1.

Alternatively, after unloading p1 at l1_1 (step10), load it into a1 and unload. That's two steps. But is there a way to combine these?

No, because you can't load and unload in the same step.

So the minimal steps for p1 would be:

- Drive to l1_7, load, drive back, unload, load into a1, unload. That's 5 steps for p1 (steps7-11).

But the current plan has steps7-12 for p1. Wait, no. Steps7-10 are for p1:

7. drive to l1_7

8. load

9. drive back

10. unload

Then steps11-12: load and unload into a1.

So that's 4 steps for p1 (7-10) plus 2 more steps (11-12), totaling 6 steps for p1.

But perhaps there's a way to use the airplane a1 to move p1, but that's not necessary since it's in the same city. But the constraint requires p1 to be in a1 at some point, so it's necessary to load and unload.

Alternatively, maybe we can load p1 into a1 and then fly it somewhere else, but that's not needed since the goal is to have p1 in l1_1. So loading into a1 and unloading right there is the way.

So the total steps are 12.

But maybe there's a shorter way.

Another approach: After step1 (load p2 into a2), fly a2 to l1_1 (step2), unload p2 (step3), load p2 into t1 (step4), drive to l1_2 (step5), unload (step6). Then, use t1 to go to l1_7, load p1, drive back, unload, load into a1, unload.

But that's the same as before.

Alternatively, after step6 (unload p2), drive t1 back to l1_1, then to l1_7, load p1, drive to l1_1, unload, load into a1, unload.

So steps:

7. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 (drive back to l1_1)

8. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_7 c1

9. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_7

10. drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_1 c1

11. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

12. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

13. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

So steps7-13, total of 13 steps. Which is longer.

So the first plan with steps1-12 is better.

But I'm not sure if there's a shorter way.

Wait, perhaps after step3 (unload p2 at l1_1), can we load p2 into t1, then drive to l1_2 and unload, then use the same truck to handle p1.

But t1 would need to be at l1_2 after unloading p2. So then, drive back to l1_1, then to l1_7, etc. Which adds steps.

Alternatively, perhaps use two trucks? But the problem only has t1 in c1 and t2 in c2. Since p2 is in c1 after step3, we can only use t1 in c1. t2 is in c2 and not useful for this.

So, the minimal plan would be 12 steps.

But maybe there's a smarter way.

Wait, what if after loading p2 into a2 (step1), we fly a2 to l1_1 (step2), unload p2 (step3), then handle p1's movement and loading into a1.

But p1 is in l1_7. So steps for p1:

4. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_7 c1

5. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_7

6. drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_1 c1

7. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

8. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

9. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

Then handle p2's movement:

10. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

11. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1

12. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

This way, the steps are 12.

But in this case, the order is:

After loading p2 into a2 and flying, we handle p1 first, then p2.

But this way, the steps for p1's loading into a1 (steps8-9) occur after step1, satisfying the constraint.

This plan has 12 steps, same as before. But the order of handling p1 and p2's truck movements differs.

Which plan is shorter? Let's count steps:

Original approach (first handling p2, then p1):

1. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

2. fly l2_1 to l1_1

3. unload p2

4. loadtruck p2 t1

5. drive to l1_2

6. unload p2

7. drive t1 back to l1_1

8. drive to l1_7

9. load p1

10. drive back to l1_1

11. unload p1

12. load into a1

13. unload from a1

Total 13 steps.

Alternative approach:

1. load p2 into a2 (step1)

2. fly to l1_1 (step2)

3. unload p2 (step3)

4. handle p1's steps:

4. drive t1 to l1_7 (step4)

5. load p1 (step5)

6. drive back (step6)

7. unload p1 (step7)

8. load into a1 (step8)

9. unload (step9)

Then handle p2:

10. load p2 into t1 (step10)

11. drive to l1_2 (step11)

12. unload p2 (step12)

Total 12 steps.

This way, it's shorter. So this plan has 12 steps.

Yes, this seems better.

So the steps would be:

1. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

2. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

3. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

4. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_7 c1

5. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_7

6. drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_1 c1

7. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

8. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

9. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

10. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

11. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1

12. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

This plan has 12 steps and satisfies all constraints.

Let's check the constraints:

- The constraint that p2 is in a2 at some state: step1.

- Then, after step1, p1 is loaded into a1 at step8, which is after step1, so the constraint is satisfied.

- The goal is achieved: p1 is in l1_1 (step7 and step9, but step9 unloads from a1, which is also l1_1, so p1 remains there). p2 is unloaded into l1_2 (step12).

Yes, this works.

But wait, after step7, p1 is in l1_1. Step8 loads it into a1, step9 unloads it back into l1_1. So the final position of p1 is l1_1, which is correct.

So this plan is valid and has 12 steps. Is there a way to make it shorter?

Is there a way to avoid steps8 and9? If p1 is already in l1_1 after step7, why load and unload from a1? Because the constraint requires that after p2 is in a2 (step1), p1 must be in a1 at some point. So steps8 and9 are necessary. Even though they don't change the final position of p1, they are required to meet the constraint.

So this plan is correct and optimal.
