Okay, let's see. I need to find a plan to get p1 to l1_5 and p2 to l1_3, while also making sure that at some point p1 is in l1_7. Let's start by understanding the initial state and the goals.

First, the initial state:

- p1 is in l2_5 (city c2)
- p2 is in l2_4 (city c2)
- t1 is in l1_3 (city c1)
- t2 is in l2_2 (city c2)
- a1 is in l1_1 (airport in c1)
- a2 is in l2_1 (airport in c2)

The goals are p1 at l1_5 (c1) and p2 at l1_3 (c1). Also, there's a constraint that p1 must be in l1_7 at least once during the plan.

So both packages start in city c2 and need to end up in city c1. That means we'll probably need to use airplanes to move them between cities since trucks can't go between cities. Let's break this down step by step.

First, for p1: it's in l2_5 (c2). To get to c1, we need to move it to an airport in c2 (l2_1), then fly it to c1's airport (l1_1), then transport it via truck to l1_5. But wait, the constraint says p1 must be in l1_7 at some point. So maybe during the transportation in c1, we need to route it through l1_7.

For p2: it's in l2_4 (c2). Similarly, need to get it to c1. Again, move to l2_1 via truck, fly to l1_1, then use a truck to l1_3. But wait, the initial state says t1 is already in l1_3. Wait, t1 is a truck in c1, right? Because l1_3 is in c1. So maybe t1 can be used to move packages in c1.

Wait, the original state says "Package t1 is in location l1_3". Wait, no, wait. Wait the objects include "truck t1" and "truck t2". The initial state says "Package t1 is in location l1_3" — that must be a typo. Wait, no, looking back: the original state says:

"Package t1 is in location l1_3"

Wait, that's a problem. Because t1 is a truck. Trucks are vehicles, not packages. So maybe that's a mistake. Wait, the user input might have an error here. Let me check again.

Looking at the original state:

"The original state of the world is the following:

[...]

"Package t1 is in location l1_3"

"Package t2 is in location l2_2"

"Package p1 is in location l2_5"

"Package p2 is in location l2_4"

"Package a1 is in location l1_1"

"Package a2 is in location l2_1"

Wait, that can't be right. Because t1 is a truck, a1 and a2 are airplanes, but the initial state lists them as packages. That's a mistake in the problem description. So perhaps the user made a typo here. Because trucks and airplanes are not packages. So maybe the correct initial state should be:

"Truck t1 is in location l1_3"

"Truck t2 is in location l2_2"

"Airplane a1 is in location l1_1"

"Airplane a2 is in location l2_1"

But the user wrote "Package t1" etc. So perhaps that's an error. But since I have to work with the given information, maybe it's a typo, and I should assume that t1 is a truck located at l1_3, not a package. Otherwise, the problem is impossible because you can't load a truck (t1) into another truck if it's a package. So I think that's a mistake and the correct initial positions are that the trucks and airplanes are in those locations as their types.

Assuming that, let's proceed.

So initial state corrected:

- Truck t1 is at l1_3 (city c1)
- Truck t2 is at l2_2 (city c2)
- Airplane a1 is at l1_1 (airport in c1)
- Airplane a2 is at l2_1 (airport in c2)
- Package p1 is at l2_5 (c2)
- Package p2 is at l2_4 (c2)

Now, the goal is p1 at l1_5 (c1), p2 at l1_3 (c1).

Constraints: p1 must be in l1_7 at some state.

So let's handle p1 first.

To get p1 from l2_5 (c2) to l1_5 (c1):

1. Move p1 to an airport in c2 (l2_1) via truck t2.
   - But t2 is in l2_2. So first, drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_5? Wait, but l2_5 is in c2. So t2 can drive within c2.

Wait, l2_5 is a location in c2. So to get p1 from l2_5, we need a truck to pick it up. But t2 is in l2_2. So steps:

- Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_5 (drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2)
- Load p1 into t2 at l2_5 (loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5)
- Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (airport in c2)
- Unload p1 at l2_1
- Load p1 into airplane a2 (since a2 is at l2_1)
- Fly a2 to l1_1 (c1's airport)
- Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1
- Then, use truck t1 (in l1_3) to drive to l1_1, load p1, drive to l1_5, then unload.

Wait, but t1 is in l1_3. So to get to l1_1, t1 needs to drive through c1's locations.

Wait, cities have locations connected via trucks. So c1 has l1_1 (airport), l1_2 to l1_8. So t1 is in l1_3. To get to l1_1, the truck would need to move through the city's locations. Assuming that locations are connected in some way, but the problem doesn't specify the connectivity. So as per the problem statement, the drivetruck action can move between any two locations in the same city. So the truck can drive from any l_from to l_to in the same city, regardless of their order. So t1 can drive from l1_3 to l1_1 directly.

Wait, but the problem states that "drivetruck t l_from l_to c": You may only move a truck t from location l_from to l_to in city c if t is in l_from and l_from and l_to are in c. So as long as both are in the same city, the truck can move between them directly.

So for t1 in l1_3 (c1), to get to l1_1, just drive directly.

So steps for p1:

1. In c2:
   - Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_5.
   - Load p1 into t2.
   - Drive t2 to l2_1 (airport).
   - Unload p1 at l2_1.
   - Load p1 into a2.
   - Fly a2 to l1_1 (c1's airport).
   - Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1.
2. In c1:
   - Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1.
   - Load p1 into t1.
   - Drive t1 to l1_5, unload. But wait, the constraint says p1 must be in l1_7. So perhaps after loading into t1, drive to l1_7 first, unload, then reload and drive to l1_5. But that adds steps. But since the constraint requires that p1 is in l1_7 in at least one state, maybe during transportation, we can have p1 pass through l1_7.

Alternatively, after unloading p1 at l1_1, we can drive t1 to l1_7, unload there (which would satisfy the constraint), then load again and drive to l1_5. But that would require two extra steps. Let's think:

Option 1:

After p1 is unloaded at l1_1:

- Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1 (to pick up p1). Wait, t1 starts at l1_3. So to load p1, t1 must be at l1_1. So first action: drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1.

Then loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1.

Then, to get to l1_5, we can drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_5. But if we do that, p1 is never in l1_7. So to meet the constraint, we need to route through l1_7.

So perhaps:

After loading p1 into t1 at l1_1:

- Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_7 (drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_7 c1). Then unload p1 at l1_7 (satisfying the constraint), then load again and drive to l1_5.

But that would require:

unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_7

then loadtruck again, then drive to l1_5.

But that's two more steps. Is there a more optimal way? Let's see. Alternatively, maybe after unloading at l1_7, we can leave p1 there, and then use another truck? But there's only t1 in c1. So no. So the only way is to unload at l1_7, then reload and move to l1_5. That adds steps, but it's necessary for the constraint.

Alternatively, maybe during the movement from l1_1 to l1_5, if there's a way to pass through l1_7. But the problem doesn't state that locations are connected in a particular way; the drivetruck action can move directly between any two locations in the same city. So the truck can go from l1_1 to l1_7 directly, then to l1_5.

So steps for p1 in c1:

- Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1 (to pick up p1)
- Load p1 into t1 at l1_1
- Drive t1 to l1_7, unload p1 there (now the constraint is satisfied)
- Then load p1 again into t1 at l1_7
- Drive to l1_5 and unload.

But this requires four actions for this part. Alternatively, if we can drive from l1_1 to l1_5 via l1_7, but the problem allows direct movement. So we can't assume that driving through l1_7 would automatically place p1 there. The only way to have p1 in l1_7 is to unload it there.

So this approach would add steps, but it's necessary.

Now, for p2:

p2 is in l2_4 (c2). Need to get to l1_3 (c1). So similar to p1:

- Use truck t2 (which is in l2_2, but after moving p1, where is t2? After moving p1, t2 would be in l2_1. So after handling p1, t2 is in l2_1. So for p2:

First, drive t2 from l2_1 (after p1 is loaded into a2) to l2_4.

Wait, but after handling p1, t2 would have driven from l2_2 to l2_5, then to l2_1. So after that, t2 is at l2_1. So to get p2 from l2_4:

- Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4 (drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2)
- Load p2 into t2 at l2_4
- Drive t2 back to l2_1 (airport)
- Unload p2 at l2_1
- Load p2 into a2 (which is now at l1_1, because a2 was flown from l2_1 to l1_1 when transporting p1). Wait, no: when we flew a2 to l1_1 for p1, after unloading p1, a2 is now at l1_1. But to transport p2, we need to fly a2 back to l2_1? Or use another airplane.

Wait, the airplanes available are a1 and a2. a1 is initially at l1_1 (c1's airport), and a2 is at l2_1 (c2's airport). So when transporting p1, we loaded it into a2 at l2_1, then flew a2 to l1_1. So after that, a2 is at l1_1. Then, to transport p2 from c2 to c1, we need another airplane. But a1 is already at l1_1. So unless we can fly a1 to c2, load p2, and fly back.

Wait, but p2 is in c2. So to get p2 to c1, we can use a2, but after a2 is in l1_1, we need to fly it back to l2_1 to pick up p2. So steps for p2:

After handling p1:

- Fly a2 from l1_1 back to l2_1 (flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1)
- Then load p2 into a2 at l2_1
- Fly a2 back to l1_1
- Unload p2 there
- Then use truck t1 (assuming t1 is now in l1_5 or l1_7?) Wait, t1's path:

After transporting p1, t1 would be in l1_5 after unloading. Wait no: let's track t1's movements.

Earlier steps for p1:

1. In c2:
   - t2 drives to l2_5, loads p1, drives to l2_1, unloads p1.
   - Load p1 into a2, fly to l1_1.
2. In c1:
   - t1 drives from l1_3 to l1_1 (to load p1)
   - Loads p1, drives to l1_7, unloads (constraint met)
   - Loads again, drives to l1_5, unloads.

So after these steps, t1 is at l1_5.

But for p2, after a2 is flown back to l2_1, load p2, fly to l1_1, then unload p2. Then, to get p2 to l1_3, which is in c1. So use truck t1 (now at l1_5) to drive to l1_1, load p2, drive to l1_3, unload.

But that would require t1 to drive from l1_5 to l1_1, load p2, then drive to l1_3.

Alternatively, if there's another truck in c1, but according to the objects, there's only t1 in c1 (truck t1 and t2; t2 is in c2). So only t1 is available in c1.

So steps for p2:

- After a2 is back at l2_1 (after flying back from l1_1), load p2 into a2.
- Fly a2 to l1_1.
- Unload p2 at l1_1.
- Then, t1 (currently at l1_5) needs to drive to l1_1 to pick up p2.
- Load p2 into t1.
- Drive t1 to l1_3 (its original location) and unload.

But that's possible. But let's check the order of actions. Also, need to make sure that airplanes are available.

Wait, but after transporting p1, a2 is at l1_1. To transport p2, we need to fly a2 back to l2_1. So steps would be:

For p2:

1. Fly a2 from l1_1 to l2_1 (flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1)
2. Load p2 into a2 at l2_1 (loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1) — wait, no. Wait, p2 is in l2_4, loaded into truck t2 which is driven to l2_1. Wait, let's re-examine.

Wait, p2 is initially in l2_4 (c2). To get it to the airport l2_1, we need to use truck t2. But after handling p1, t2 is at l2_1 (after driving p1 there). So after p1 is handled, t2 is at l2_1. So for p2:

- Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4 (drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2)
- Load p2 into t2 at l2_4
- Drive t2 back to l2_1
- Unload p2 at l2_1
- Load p2 into a2 (which is now back at l2_1 after flying back from l1_1)
- Fly a2 to l1_1
- Unload p2
- Then, use t1 to transport p2 to l1_3.

But t1 is at l1_5 after delivering p1. So t1 needs to drive from l1_5 to l1_1, load p2, then drive to l1_3.

So let's compile all steps.

But let's outline the entire plan step by step, considering both packages and the constraint.

First, handle p1:

1. In c2:
   - drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2 (t2 moves to p1's location)
   - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
   - drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 (move to airport)
   - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
   - loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (a2 is at l2_1 initially)
   - flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (a2 now at l1_1)
   - unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (p1 is at l1_1)

2. In c1:
   - drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1 (t1 moves to airport)
   - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
   - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_7 c1 (to meet constraint)
   - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_7 (now p1 is in l1_7, satisfying the constraint)
   - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_7 (reload)
   - drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_5 c1 (move to goal)
   - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 (p1 at goal)

Now, handle p2:

3. In c2:
   - After a2 flew to l1_1, need to return it to l2_1 to carry p2.
   - flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1 (fly back)
   - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2 (t2 was at l2_1 after moving p1)
   - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
   - drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2 (back to airport)
   - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
   - loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
   - flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
   - unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

4. In c1:
   - t1 is at l1_5 after delivering p1. Need to move to l1_1 to get p2.
   - drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
   - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1 (original location is l1_3)
   - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (p2 at goal)

Now, let's check if all steps are necessary and if the plan is optimal.

But wait, after moving p1, a2 is at l1_1. To move p2, we have to fly a2 back to l2_1. That's two flights for a2: l2_1 -> l1_1 (for p1), then l1_1 -> l2_1 (for p2), then l2_1 -> l1_1 again (with p2). That's three flights for a2. Alternatively, could we use a1 (which is in l1_1) to transport p2?

But a1 is in l1_1 (c1's airport). To use a1 for p2, we'd need to fly a1 to l2_1, load p2, then fly back. But initially, a1 is at l1_1. So steps would be:

For p2:

- Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1
- Load p2 into a1 at l2_1
- Fly a1 back to l1_1
- Unload p2

But this would require two flights for a1. But maybe this is shorter than using a2, which requires three flights. Let's compare.

Original plan using a2:

- a2 starts at l2_1, flies to l1_1 (for p1)
- then flies back to l2_1 (for p2)
- then flies to l1_1 again (with p2)
Total flights: 3.

Alternative plan using a1 for p2:

- a1 starts at l1_1, flies to l2_1
- flies back to l1_1 with p2
Total flights: 2.

But this would require:

For p2:

- In c2, after transporting p1:

   - Use t2 to bring p2 to l2_1
   - Load into a1 (which is flown to l2_1)
   - Fly a1 back.

So steps would be:

After p1 is done:

3. In c2:
   - flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (to pick up p2)
   - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2 (t2 is at l2_1)
   - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
   - drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
   - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
   - loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
   - flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
   - unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

Then in c1:

4. Use t1 (at l1_5) to drive to l1_1, load p2, drive to l1_3, unload.

This saves one flight compared to using a2. So the total flights for a2 would be 2 (for p1 and p2?), but wait, no. If we use a1 for p2, then a2 is only used for p1, which is one flight. a1 is used for p2: two flights. Total flights: 3 (a2's flight to l1_1, a1's flight to l2_1 and back). But maybe this is more optimal.

So comparing the two options:

Option 1 (using a2 for both):

- a2 flies l2_1 -> l1_1 (p1)
- a2 flies l1_1 -> l2_1 (back)
- a2 flies l2_1 -> l1_1 (p2)
Total: 3 flights.

Option 2 (using a1 for p2):

- a2 flies l2_1 -> l1_1 (p1)
- a1 flies l1_1 -> l2_1 (to get p2)
- a1 flies l2_1 -> l1_1 (p2)
Total: 3 flights (same number). But in option 2, we use both airplanes, but same number of steps.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to transport both packages in one flight, but since they're in different locations, probably not.

So it doesn't save steps. But maybe the plan can be optimized by reusing a2 for p2 after it's back in l2_1.

But let's proceed with the initial plan using a2 for both, assuming that it's the only way.

Now, let's check the steps again for p1 and p2, ensuring all preconditions are met and the constraint is satisfied.

For p1's constraint (being in l1_7), during the transportation in c1, after loading into t1 at l1_1, the truck drives to l1_7, unloads p1 there (so the state after this unload has p1 in l1_7), then reloads and moves to l1_5. This satisfies the constraint.

Now, compiling the entire plan:

Actions for p1:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
3. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
5. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
6. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
7. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
8. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
9. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
10. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_7 c1
11. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_7 (constraint met here)
12. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_7
13. drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_5 c1
14. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5

Actions for p2:

15. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1 (return to c2)
16. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
17. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
18. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
19. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
20. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
21. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
22. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
23. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
24. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
25. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
26. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

But this plan has 26 actions. However, some steps might be redundant or can be optimized.

Wait, step 15 is flying a2 back to l2_1. Then steps 16-22 handle p2's transport. Let's see:

But after step 14, t1 is at l1_5. So steps 23-26 are for moving p2 from l1_1 to l1_3 using t1.

But perhaps there's a way to optimize. For example, after step 22 (p2 is at l1_1), can we have t1, which is at l1_5, drive to l1_1, load p2, then drive to l1_3. That's steps 23-26 as above.

But is there a way to combine steps or make it shorter? Let's see.

Another thing to check: when transporting p2, after step 21 (fly a2 to l1_1), we unload p2 there. Then t1 is at l1_5. So t1 needs to go to l1_1 to pick up p2. So yes, steps 23-26 are needed.

But is this the optimal plan? Are there any redundant steps?

Alternative approach: Could we combine the transport of p1 and p2 in the same flight? For example, after p1 is loaded into a2, could we also load p2 into a2 if we can get p2 to l2_1 in time. But initially, p2 is in l2_4. So if we first transport p2 to l2_1 while a2 is still there, then load both p1 and p2 into a2 and fly them together. But initially, a2 is at l2_1. So steps:

But p1 is at l2_5. So first, t2 moves to l2_5, loads p1, drives to l2_1. Then, during the same time, could we also move p2 to l2_1?

But t2 is used to move p1. So after moving p1, t2 is at l2_1. Then, drive t2 to l2_4 to get p2, load, drive back to l2_1, then load both packages into a2. But this would require:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
3. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
5. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
6. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
7. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
8. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
9. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
10. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (but can an airplane carry multiple packages? The problem doesn't specify any capacity limits, so assuming yes.)
11. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
12. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
13. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

This would save flights. Then, both p1 and p2 are at l1_1. Then, use t1 to move p1 to l1_5 via l1_7, and p2 to l1_3.

This approach would reduce the number of flights. But does the problem allow loading multiple packages into the same airplane? The actions are defined as loading a single package each time. So each load action is per package. So steps 9 and 10 are separate load actions. But that's possible.

Then, after both are loaded, fly once to l1_1, unload both.

This would save one flight (since both packages are transported in one flight). Then, steps for p1 and p2 in c1 can be handled in parallel or sequentially.

This would make the plan more optimal. Let's explore this.

Revised plan:

For both packages:

1. In c2:
   - Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_5 (p1's location)
   - Load p1 into t2
   - Drive t2 to l2_1 (airport)
   - Unload p1 at l2_1
   - Drive t2 to l2_4 (p2's location)
   - Load p2 into t2
   - Drive t2 back to l2_1
   - Unload p2 at l2_1
   - Load both p1 and p2 into a2
   - Fly a2 to l1_1
   - Unload both p1 and p2 at l1_1

Then, in c1:

For p1:

- Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1
- Load p1
- Drive to l1_7, unload (constraint met)
- Reload and drive to l1_5

For p2:

- After unloading at l1_1, drive t1 (after delivering p1) to l1_1, load p2, drive to l1_3.

But wait, t1 can carry both packages if possible, but they need to be loaded and unloaded separately.

So detailed steps:

In c2:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
3. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2

In c1:

15. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
16. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_7 c1
17. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_7 (constraint met)
18. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_7
19. drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_5 c1
20. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5

For p2:

21. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1 (after delivering p1, t1 is at l1_5)
22. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
23. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
24. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

This plan has 24 actions, which is shorter than the previous 26. But is this valid? Let's check the preconditions.

At step 9 and 10: after unloading p1 and p2 at l2_1, loading them into a2. Yes, as long as a2 is at l2_1. Then flying to l1_1. Unloading both. 

But airplanes can only be loaded and unload one package at a time? The action definitions are per package. So each package needs its own load and unload actions. So steps 9 and 10 are correct.

Then, steps 12 and 13 unload each package separately.

In c1, t1 starts at l1_3. After step 14, it's at l1_1. Load p1 (step15), drive to l1_7 (16), unload (17), reload (18), drive to l1_5 (19), unload (20). Then, drive back to l1_1 (step21), load p2 (22), drive to l1_3 (23), unload (24).

This seems valid.

This plan has 24 steps. But can we make it even shorter?

For example, after unloading p1 and p2 at l1_1, can t1 pick up both packages in one trip? No, because each load action is per package. So t1 would need to make two trips: one for p1 and one for p2. But that would take more steps. Alternatively, since p1 and p2 are both at l1_1, perhaps t1 can load both in one go, but according to the action definitions, each load is for a single package.

Thus, we need separate load actions for each package. But in this case, p1 and p2 are at l1_1. So after moving t1 to l1_1, we can load p1, then after delivering p1 to l1_5, come back and load p2. But that would require t1 to go back to l1_1 again, adding steps. So the current plan where t1 first handles p1, then p2 is more efficient.

But wait, after step 20, t1 is at l1_5. Then, step 21: drive to l1_1 (which is in c1), load p2 (step22), drive to l1_3 (step23), unload (step24). This is necessary.

Alternatively, after unloading p1 at l1_5 (step20), could t1 immediately drive to l1_1, load p2, and then drive to l1_3. That's what's already in the plan.

So this seems optimal.

But wait, another optimization: after step 17 (unload p1 at l1_7), instead of reloading p1 and driving to l1_5, perhaps we can leave p1 at l1_7 and use another method. But no, because the goal requires p1 to be at l1_5. So we have to move it from l1_7 to l1_5.

Thus, steps 17-20 are necessary.

Now, check if this plan meets all constraints and preconditions.

For example, when flying a2 from l2_1 to l1_1 (step11), a2 must be at l2_1, which it is after steps 1-10.

Loading p1 and p2 into a2: both are at l2_1, and a2 is there. So steps 9 and 10 are valid.

Unloading both packages at l1_1: yes, after flying there.

Then, moving t1 to l1_1 to load p1: correct.

This plan seems valid.

Now, check the constraint: p1 must be in l1_7 at some state. Step17 unloads p1 there, so that's satisfied.

The goals are p1 at l1_5 (step20) and p2 at l1_3 (step24).

This plan has 24 steps. Is there a way to make it shorter?

Let's see:

Alternative approach: After transporting both packages to l1_1, use t1 to pick up both packages in one trip. But since each load and unload is per package, it's not possible. So t1 would need to make two separate trips.

Alternatively, can we route t1 to l1_1, load p1, drive to l1_7 (unload), then to l1_5, and then on the way back pick up p2? Let's see:

After step14, t1 is at l1_1.

Steps:

15. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

16. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_7 c1

17. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_7 (constraint met)

18. drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_5 c1

19. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 (now p1 is at goal)

But then, t1 is at l1_5. Then, drive back to l1_1 to get p2:

20. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1

21. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

22. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1

23. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

This saves a few steps compared to the previous plan. Wait, how?

In the earlier version, steps 18-20 were:

18. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_7

19. drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_5 c1

20. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5

But if we instead unload at l1_7 (step17), then drive to l1_5 without reloading, but p1 is already unloaded. So that's not possible. Wait, no. After unloading at l1_7, p1 is there. To get it to l1_5, we need to have it loaded into the truck again.

So the original approach is necessary: unload at l1_7 (step17), then load again (step18), drive to l1_5 (step19), unload (step20).

But maybe there's a way to have t1 carry p1 to l1_7, unload (meeting the constraint), then continue to l1_5 with p1. But no, because once unloaded, p1 is no longer in the truck. So you have to reload.

Thus, steps 17-20 are necessary.

So the total steps remain the same.

Therefore, the plan with 24 actions seems to be the optimal one.

But let's count again:

Steps 1-13: 13 steps for transporting both packages to l1_1.

Steps 14-20: 7 steps for p1.

Steps 21-24: 4 steps for p2.

Total: 13+7+4=24.

But maybe there's a way to interleave steps to save actions.

For example, after step13 (both packages are at l1_1), start moving t1 to handle p1 and p2 in a more optimal way.

Alternatively, after unloading both packages at l1_1, can t1 first load p2 and drop it off at l1_3, then handle p1. But that would mean p1's constraint is handled later, but would that be possible?

Let's try:

After step13 (p1 and p2 at l1_1):

14. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1

15. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

16. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1

17. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (p2 delivered)

Then handle p1:

18. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1

19. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

20. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_7 c1

21. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_7 (constraint)

22. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_7

23. drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_5 c1

24. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5

This would have 24 steps as well. But the order of delivering p2 first might save steps if there's any overlap. But the total steps are the same.

Thus, the plan length remains 24. So it's optimal.

But is there a way to shorten it further?

Another idea: After step14 (t1 at l1_1), load both p1 and p2 into t1, drive to l1_7, unload p1 (constraint met), then drive to l1_3 and unload p2, then drive to l1_5 and unload p1. But no, because you can't load both packages unless you do separate load actions, and you can't unload selectively. Each unload specifies which package.

But according to the action definitions, unloadtruck requires specifying the package. So you can unload p1 at l1_7, then p2 at l1_3. But to do that, you'd have to load both packages into the truck first.

So steps:

After step13:

14. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1

15. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

16. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (but truck can carry both?)

Assuming trucks can carry multiple packages (no capacity limit), which the problem doesn't restrict.

Then:

17. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_7 c1

18. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_7 (constraint met)

19. drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_3 c1

20. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

21. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_5 c1

22. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5

But does this work?

After step16, both p1 and p2 are in t1. Then, when unloading p1 at l1_7 (step18), p1 is removed from t1, leaving p2 still in t1. Then, drive to l1_3, unload p2 (step20). Then, drive to l1_5 and unload p1? But p1 was already unloaded at l1_7. So this wouldn't work.

Wait, no. After unloading p1 at l1_7 (step18), p1 is at l1_7, and p2 is still in t1. Then, drive to l1_3 and unload p2 (step20). Then, drive to l1_5 and there's no p1 in the truck. So this approach would not deliver p1 to l1_5. Thus, this is invalid.

Thus, this approach won't work. Therefore, the initial plan of handling p1 first, then p2 is necessary.

Thus, the plan with 24 steps seems to be the optimal one.
