Let me analyze the problem:

1. We have a world with cities, locations, airports, trucks, airplanes, and packages.
2. We need to transport packages p1 and p2 to specific locations:
   - Package p1 needs to end up in location l1_5
   - Package p2 needs to end up in location l1_3
3. There's a constraint that at some point in our plan, p1 must be in location l1_7

Let's start by understanding the initial state:
- Package p1 is in location l2_5 (city c2)
- Package p2 is in location l2_4 (city c2) 
- Truck t1 is in location l1_3 (city c1)
- Truck t2 is in location l2_2 (city c2)
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (city c1) - this is an airport
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1 (city c2) - this is an airport

Wait, there's something odd. The problem statement says "Package t1 is in location l1_3" and "Package t2 is in location l2_2" but t1 and t2 are trucks, not packages. Also, it says "Package a1 is in location l1_1" and "Package a2 is in location l2_1" but a1 and a2 are airplanes. I think there's a typo in the initial state description.

Let me assume the correct initial state is:
- Package p1 is in location l2_5 (city c2)
- Package p2 is in location l2_4 (city c2)
- Truck t1 is in location l1_3 (city c1)
- Truck t2 is in location l2_2 (city c2)
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (city c1) - this is an airport
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1 (city c2) - this is an airport

Let's plan how to achieve our goal:

1. For package p1 (currently in l2_5 in city c2, needs to go to l1_5 in city c1):
   - We need to use truck t2 to pick up p1 from l2_5 and drive it to the airport l2_1
   - Then load p1 onto airplane a2
   - Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1
   - Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1
   - Load p1 onto truck t1 (we need to drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1 first)
   - Drive t1 with p1 from l1_1 to l1_7 (to satisfy the constraint)
   - Then drive t1 with p1 from l1_7 to l1_5
   - Unload p1 at l1_5

2. For package p2 (currently in l2_4 in city c2, needs to go to l1_3 in city c1):
   - We need to use truck t2 to pick up p2 from l2_4 and drive it to the airport l2_1
   - Then load p2 onto airplane a2
   - Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1 (if not already done)
   - Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1
   - Load p2 onto truck t1
   - Drive t1 with p2 from l1_1 to l1_3
   - Unload p2 at l1_3

Let's optimize this plan. We need to consider that:
- Both packages start in city c2 and need to end up in city c1
- We need truck t2 to bring them to the airport in c2
- We need to fly them to c1
- We need truck t1 to deliver them in c1

For efficiency, we should:
1. Use t2 to collect both packages and bring them to l2_1
2. Use a2 to fly both packages to l1_1
3. Use t1 to deliver both packages to their final destinations
4. Ensure that p1 passes through l1_7 at some point

Let me work out a detailed plan:

Initial state:
- p1 is in l2_5
- p2 is in l2_4
- t1 is in l1_3
- t2 is in l2_2
- a1 is in l1_1
- a2 is in l2_1

Step 1: Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_5 to pick up p1
```
drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
```

Step 2: Load p1 into t2 at l2_5
```
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
```

Step 3: Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_4 to pick up p2
```
drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2
```

Step 4: Load p2 into t2 at l2_4
```
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
```

Step 5: Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1 (airport)
```
drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
```

Step 6: Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1
```
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
```

Step 7: Load p1 into a2 at l2_1
```
loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
```

Step 8: Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1
```
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
```

Step 9: Load p2 into a2 at l2_1
```
loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
```

Step 10: Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1
```
flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
```

Step 11: Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1
```
unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
```

Step 12: Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1
```
unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
```

Step 13: Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1
```
drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
```

Step 14: Load p1 into t1 at l1_1
```
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
```

Step 15: Load p2 into t1 at l1_1
```
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
```

Step 16: Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_7 (to satisfy the constraint for p1)
```
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_7 c1
```

Step 17: Drive t1 from l1_7 to l1_3 to drop off p2
```
drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_3 c1
```

Step 18: Unload p2 from t1 at l1_3
```
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
```

Step 19: Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_5 to drop off p1
```
drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_5 c1
```

Step 20: Unload p1 from t1 at l1_5
```
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
```

This plan should satisfy all the requirements:
- p1 ends up in l1_5
- p2 ends up in l1_3
- p1 passes through l1_7 during the plan (step 16)

However, I notice that I confused myself with the "loadairplane" and "unloadairplane" actions. Let me reread the specifications again.

The actions for airplanes should be:
- loadairplane p ap l: Load package p in airplane ap at location l (both p and ap are in l)
- unloadairplane p ap l: Unload package p from airplane ap at location l (ap is in l and p is in ap)

I had the correct understanding, so my plan seems okay from that perspective.

Wait, I just realized another issue. The problem statement describes loadairplane twice and doesn't list unloadairplane. But looking at the context, one of those "loadairplane" entries should be "unloadairplane". I'm assuming the second one is supposed to be "unloadairplane", which matches my understanding above.

Let me review my plan once more to ensure it's optimal:

1. We start with two packages in city c2 that need to go to city c1
2. We use truck t2 to get both packages to the airport in c2
3. We use airplane a2 to fly both packages to the airport in c1
4. We use truck t1 to deliver both packages to their final destinations in c1
5. We make sure that p1 passes through l1_7 at some point

I think this is the most efficient approach given the constraints. However, there's one optimization I missed: after picking up p1, t2 should go directly to l2_4 to pick up p2, then to the airport. I'll adjust the plan:

Let me detail the final plan:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
3. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2
4. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
5. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
6. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
7. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
8. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
9. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
10. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
11. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
12. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
13. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
14. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
15. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
16. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_7 c1
17. drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_3 c1
18. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
19. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_5 c1
20. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5

This plan is optimal given the constraints. I've ensured that both packages are moved efficiently to their target locations, and p1 passes through l1_7 as required.

Actually, I realized that we could potentially optimize this plan further. We don't need to keep both packages in the truck while driving to l1_7. We could have dropped off p2 at l1_3 during the initial journey and then gone to l1_7 with just p1. Let me revise the plan:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
3. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2
4. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
5. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
6. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
7. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
8. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
9. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
10. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
11. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
12. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
13. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
14. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
15. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
16. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
17. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
18. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_7 c1
19. drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_5 c1
20. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5

Let me analyze the paths to see which is more efficient:

Original plan:
1. l1_1 -> l1_7 -> l1_3 -> l1_5
   Total distance: distance(l1_1, l1_7) + distance(l1_7, l1_3) + distance(l1_3, l1_5)

Alternative plan:
2. l1_1 -> l1_3 -> l1_7 -> l1_5
   Total distance: distance(l1_1, l1_3) + distance(l1_3, l1_7) + distance(l1_7, l1_5)

Without knowing the specific distances between locations, it's hard to say which is more efficient. However, both plans have the same number of actions, so they are equally optimal in terms of plan length. I'll go with the alternative plan since it seems more natural to drop off p2 at the first opportunity.

Let me write out the final plan:

```
drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_7 c1
drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_5 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
```

This is the most efficient plan I can devise given the constraints.

Actually, I just realized an inconsistency. In the initial state, it says:
- "Package t1 is in location l1_3"
- "Package t2 is in location l2_2"
- "Package p1 is in location l2_5"
- "Package p2 is in location l2_4"
- "Package a1 is in location l1_1"
- "Package a2 is in location l2_1"

This is definitely a typo, as t1, t2, a1, and a2 are not packages. Let me assume the correct initial state:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_3
- Truck t2 is in location l2_2
- Package p1 is in location l2_5
- Package p2 is in location l2_4
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

With this assumption, my plan above is still valid and optimal.
