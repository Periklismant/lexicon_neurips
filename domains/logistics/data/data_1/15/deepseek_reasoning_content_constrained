Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. So, the goal is to get package p1 to l1_1 and p2 to l1_4. But there's a constraint that at some point, either p1 is in l1_2 or p2 is in l2_3. Hmm, let me start by understanding the initial state and the available resources.

First, the initial state:

- Cities c1 and c2 each have locations. c1 has l1_1 (airport), l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5. c2 has l2_1 (airport), l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5.
- Packages: p1 is in l2_5 (city c2), p2 is in l2_2 (city c2).
- Trucks: t1 is in l1_2 (c1), t2 is in l2_1 (c2, which is an airport).
- Airplanes: a1 is in l1_1 (c1's airport), a2 is in l2_1 (c2's airport).

The goal is p1 at l1_1 (c1's airport) and p2 at l1_4 (c1). The constraint requires that at some point in the plan, either p1 is in l1_2 or p2 is in l2_3.

So, to get p1 from l2_5 (c2) to l1_1 (c1), we need to move it between cities. Since airplanes can fly between airports, maybe we can use a2 (in l2_1) to carry p1. But p1 is in l2_5, which is a non-airport location in c2. So we need a truck in c2 to pick up p1 and bring it to the airport l2_1, then load it onto a2, fly to l1_1, unload, and then maybe use a truck in c1 to move it to l1_1 (but wait, l1_1 is the airport, so maybe it's already there after unloading). Wait, the goal is for p1 to be in l1_1, which is an airport. So if we unload it there, that's done. But the trucks in c1 are t1, which is in l1_2. So maybe we don't need a truck for p1's final destination.

For p2, it's in l2_2 (c2), needs to go to l1_4 (c1). So similar process: use a truck in c2 to take p2 to the airport l2_1, load onto a2, fly to l1_1, then unload and use a truck in c1 (t1) to take it to l1_4. But wait, t1 is in l1_2. So we might need to drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1 (airport) to load p2 there, then drive to l1_4. Wait, but after unloading p2 at l1_1, we need to load it onto t1. But t1 is initially in l1_2. So first, drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1, then load p2 into t1, then drive to l1_4 and unload.

But wait, how does p2 get from c2 to c1? So steps for p2:

1. In c2, p2 is in l2_2. Need to get it to l2_1 (airport) via a truck. The truck in c2 is t2, which is in l2_1. Wait, t2 is in l2_1 already. So if we can get p2 to l2_1, then load it onto a2. But how? Since t2 is in l2_1, but p2 is in l2_2. So we need to drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2, load p2 into t2, drive back to l2_1, unload p2 into the airport, then load onto a2.

Wait, but can trucks move between locations in their city? Yes. So for p2:

- Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2 (c2).
- Load p2 into t2 at l2_2.
- Drive t2 back to l2_1.
- Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1.
- Load p2 onto a2 at l2_1.
- Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1 (c1's airport).
- Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1.
- Then, use t1 in c1. t1 is in l1_2. So drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1.
- Load p2 into t1 at l1_1.
- Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_4.
- Unload p2 at l1_4.

That's for p2.

For p1, which is in l2_5 (c2):

- Need to get to l2_1 airport. So use t2 again. But t2 is already in l2_1 after moving p2. Wait, but after handling p2, t2 is back at l2_1. So maybe first handle p1.

Wait, but the order might matter. Let's think.

p1 is in l2_5. So steps:

- Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_5 (c2). Wait, can t2 move from l2_1 to l2_5 directly? The cities have locations l2_1, l2_2, etc. Are the locations connected in a way that allows driving between any locations in the same city? The problem says trucks can move between locations in their city, so yes. So t2 can drive to l2_5.

So for p1:

- Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_5.
- Load p1 into t2 at l2_5.
- Drive t2 back to l2_1.
- Unload p1 at l2_1.
- Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1.
- Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
- Unload p1 at l1_1 (goal achieved).

But then, how do we handle both p1 and p2? Because a2 can carry both packages, but we need to fly it from l2_1 to l1_1. Maybe we can load both p1 and p2 onto a2 and fly once. But the order of loading and flying matters.

Wait, let's outline the steps for both packages:

First, handle p2:

1. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2 (since p2 is there).
2. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_2.
3. Drive t2 back to l2_1.
4. Unload p2 at l2_1.
5. Load p2 onto a2 at l2_1.

Then handle p1:

6. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_5.
7. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_5.
8. Drive t2 back to l2_1.
9. Unload p1 at l2_1.
10. Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1.

11. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.

12. Unload p1 and p2 from a2 at l1_1.

But wait, unloading is per package. So after flying, we need to unload both.

Then, for p1, it's already at l1_1 (goal). For p2, we need to move it to l1_4 using t1.

13. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1.
14. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_1.
15. Drive t1 to l1_4.
16. Unload p2 at l1_4.

But wait, in step 12, when we unload p2 from a2 at l1_1, it's in l1_1. So steps 13-16 would move it to l1_4.

But this plan uses a2 to carry both packages. However, the constraint is that at some point, p1 is in l1_2 or p2 is in l2_3. Let's check if this plan meets that.

In the current steps, when does p1 or p2 reach those locations? Let's see:

In the initial state, p1 is in l2_5, p2 in l2_2. The first movement for p2 is to l2_2 (loaded into t2, then moved to l2_1). So p2 is in l2_2 initially, then goes to l2_1. No step where p2 is in l2_3. So the constraint isn't met here. Similarly, p1 is moved from l2_5 to l2_1 via t2. So neither condition is met. Therefore, this plan doesn't satisfy the constraint. So we need to adjust the plan to include a state where either p1 is in l1_2 or p2 is in l2_3.

Hmm. So how can we achieve this?

Let's think: Maybe during the transportation of p2, we can make a detour through l2_3. But p2 starts in l2_2. To get to l2_3, we can drive t2 through l2_3. For example, when moving p2 from l2_2 to l2_1, perhaps take a route that goes through l2_3. But in the problem statement, the "drivetruck" action allows moving directly between any two locations in the same city. So maybe the cities are connected such that you can drive directly between any locations. So the truck can go from l2_2 to l2_3 directly. So perhaps after loading p2 into t2 at l2_2, drive to l2_3 first, then to l2_1. That way, p2 would be in l2_3 (unloaded? No, because it's in the truck. Wait, to have p2 in l2_3, we need to unload it there. But if we do that, then reload it again. But that would add steps. Let's see:

Alternative approach for p2:

1. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2.
2. Load p2 into t2 at l2_2.
3. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_3. Now, p2 is in t2, which is in l2_3. But the condition is that p2 is in l2_3. But since p2 is in the truck at l2_3, does that count as being in l2_3? No, because the package is in the truck, not in the location. So to make p2 be in l2_3, we need to unload it there. So maybe:

3. Drive t2 to l2_3.
4. Unload p2 at l2_3. (Now, p2 is in l2_3, satisfying the constraint)
5. Then load p2 back into t2.
6. Drive to l2_1, etc.

But this adds two extra steps (unload and load). However, the constraint requires that in at least one state (i.e., at some point in the plan), one of the conditions holds. So if during the transportation of p2, we unload it at l2_3, then that satisfies the constraint.

So modifying the plan for p2:

Original steps for p2 would be:

Drive t2 to l2_2, load, drive to l2_1, unload, load onto a2, fly, etc.

But to include a step where p2 is in l2_3, we can:

After loading p2 into t2 at l2_2, drive t2 to l2_3, unload p2 there (satisfying the constraint), then load it back, drive to l2_1, and proceed.

So the steps would be:

For p2:

1. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2.
2. Load p2 into t2 at l2_2.
3. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_3.
4. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_3. (Now, the constraint is met here)
5. Load p2 into t2 at l2_3.
6. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1.
7. Unload p2 at l2_1.
8. Load p2 onto a2.

This way, the state after step 4 has p2 in l2_3, satisfying the constraint.

But this adds steps. However, the problem requires an optimal plan (shortest possible). So maybe this approach increases the number of steps, but is there a way to satisfy the constraint without adding steps?

Alternatively, maybe we can have p1 pass through l1_2. But p1's path is from l2_5 to l2_1 (via truck), then to l1_1 via airplane. So unless we have a step where p1 is unloaded in l1_2, which is in c1. But how would p1 get there? The only truck in c1 is t1, which is in l1_2 initially. Wait, t1 is in l1_2. So if p1 is unloaded at l1_2, that would meet the condition. So perhaps after flying p1 to l1_1 (airport), we can load it into t1 and drive to l1_2, then unload, then drive back to l1_1. But that would add steps. Alternatively, maybe during the process of moving p2, we can have p1 go through l1_2.

Wait, the goal for p1 is to be in l1_1. So if we take p1 to l1_2 and then back to l1_1, that would satisfy the constraint (since p1 is in l1_2 at some point), but adds steps. Let's see:

After flying p1 to l1_1:

- Unload p1 from a2 into l1_1.
- Then load p1 into t1 (which is in l1_2? No, t1 is in l1_2 initially. Wait, to load p1 into t1, both need to be at the same location. So we need to drive t1 to l1_1 first.

Wait, the initial state has t1 in l1_2. So steps:

After p1 is in l1_1 (unloaded from a2):

- Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1.
- Load p1 into t1.
- Drive t1 back to l1_2.
- Unload p1 at l1_2. (Now, the constraint is met)
- Then load p1 again into t1, drive to l1_1, unload. But this is redundant because the goal is l1_1, so this would undo the goal. So that's not feasible.

Alternatively, after unloading p1 at l1_1, the goal is already met. So we can't move it again. Therefore, that approach won't work.

So the only way to satisfy the constraint is to have p2 pass through l2_3. Let's proceed with modifying the p2 steps to include unloading at l2_3.

So the plan would have:

For p2:

1. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2.
2. Load p2 into t2.
3. Drive t2 to l2_3.
4. Unload p2 in l2_3. (Constraint met here)
5. Load p2 back into t2.
6. Drive t2 to l2_1.
7. Unload p2 at l2_1.
8. Load p2 onto a2.

Then fly a2 to l1_1, unload p2, then use t1 to take it to l1_4.

Now, for p1:

9. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_5.
10. Load p1 into t2.
11. Drive t2 back to l2_1.
12. Unload p1.
13. Load p1 onto a2.
14. Fly a2 to l1_1.
15. Unload p1.

Then for p2:

16. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1.
17. Load p2 into t1.
18. Drive t1 to l1_4.
19. Unload p2.

But this seems longer. However, we need to check if the constraint is satisfied in step 4 (p2 in l2_3). Let's count the steps and see if there's a more optimal way.

Alternatively, maybe we can combine the transportation of p1 and p2 in a way that satisfies the constraint without adding extra steps. For example, when moving p1, perhaps use a different route that meets the constraint. But p1 is in c2 initially. The constraint requires p1 to be in l1_2 (c1) or p2 in l2_3 (c2). So for p1 to be in l1_2, it has to be transported there, but the goal is l1_1, which is the airport. So unless we temporarily move p1 to l1_2, but that's out of the way.

Alternatively, perhaps when moving p2, after loading it into a2, fly to l1_1, then use t1 to move it to l1_4. But t1 is in l1_2. So we have to drive t1 to l1_1 to load p2. That's necessary steps. But during that process, when t1 is in l1_2, if we load p2 there, but p2 is in t1 at l1_2, which would not count as being in l1_2. Because the package is in the truck, not the location.

Wait, the condition is "Package p2 is in location l2_3" or "Package p1 is in location l1_2". So the package has to be in the location, not in a vehicle there.

So the only way is to have p2 unloaded in l2_3 or p1 unloaded in l1_2.

So the earlier approach of unloading p2 in l2_3 is necessary.

Thus, the plan must include that step. Let's proceed with that.

Now, let's outline the full plan with steps:

1. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2. (to get p2)
2. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2.
3. Drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2. (move to l2_3)
4. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3. (now p2 is in l2_3, satisfying the constraint)
5. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3.
6. Drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2.
7. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.
8. Loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1.
9. Now, handle p1:
   Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_5.
10. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5.
11. Drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2.
12. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1.
13. Loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1.
14. Flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.
15. Unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1. (p1 is at goal)
16. Unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1. (p2 is now at l1_1)
17. Now, move p2 to l1_4 using t1 in c1:
    Drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1.
18. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.
19. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1.
20. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4. (p2 at goal)

But wait, in step 14, after flying a2 to l1_1, both p1 and p2 are on a2. So steps 15 and 16 unload both packages. But the order matters. Each unload is a separate action. So steps 15 and 16 are two separate unload actions.

But the problem is that after step 14, a2 is at l1_1. So:

15. Unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1.
16. Unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1.

Then steps 17-20 for p2.

But this plan has 20 steps. However, maybe there's a way to optimize.

Wait, after step 8, p2 is loaded onto a2. Then, after steps 13, a2 is loaded with both p1 and p2. Then fly once. Then unload both. So steps 8 and 13 are both loadairplane actions. Let's check:

After step 8: p2 is in a2 at l2_1.

Then, steps 9-13: load p1 into a2. So step 13 is loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1.

But wait, after step 8, a2 is at l2_1, and p2 is loaded. Then steps 9-12 involve moving t2 to get p1, load into t2, drive back, unload p1 at l2_1. Then step 13 loads p1 into a2, which is still at l2_1. Then step 14 fly to l1_1. Then unload both.

So yes, that works.

Now, the steps count is:

1. Drive t2 to l2_2.
2. Load p2.
3. Drive to l2_3.
4. Unload p2 (constraint met).
5. Load p2 again.
6. Drive to l2_1.
7. Unload p2.
8. Load p2 onto a2.
9. Drive t2 to l2_5.
10. Load p1.
11. Drive back to l2_1.
12. Unload p1.
13. Load p1 onto a2.
14. Fly to l1_1.
15. Unload p1.
16. Unload p2.
17. Drive t1 to l1_1.
18. Load p2.
19. Drive to l1_4.
20. Unload p2.

That's 20 steps. But maybe there's a shorter way. For example, can we load both p1 and p2 onto a2 in fewer steps? Let's see.

After step 7, p2 is at l2_1. Then, steps 9-12 are for p1:

9. Drive t2 to l2_5.
10. Load p1.
11. Drive back to l2_1.
12. Unload p1.

Then step 13: load p1 onto a2.

So steps 8 and 13 are two separate loadairplane actions. Then fly once. So yes.

Alternatively, can we handle p1 and p2 in parallel? For example, after step 3 (drive t2 to l2_3), unload p2 (step4), then drive to l2_5 to pick up p1. But that might complicate things.

Alternatively:

After step 3 (drive t2 to l2_3), unload p2 (step4), then drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_5 (step5), load p1 (step6), drive back to l2_1 (step7), unload p1 (step8), load p1 onto a2 (step9), then load p2 onto a2 (step10), fly, etc. But that would require p2 to be in l2_3, then t2 drives to l2_5, leaving p2 in l2_3. But after unloading p2 in l2_3 (step4), to load it again, t2 would have to go back to l2_3. So this approach may not work.

Alternatively, after unloading p2 in l2_3 (step4), load p2 back into t2 (step5), then drive t2 to l2_5 (step6), load p1 (step7), drive back to l2_1 (step8), unload both p2 and p1 (steps9 and 10), load both onto a2 (steps11 and 12), fly (step13), etc. This might save some steps.

Let me try:

1. Drive t2 to l2_2.
2. Load p2.
3. Drive to l2_3.
4. Unload p2. (constraint met)
5. Load p2 back.
6. Drive to l2_5.
7. Load p1.
8. Drive to l2_1.
9. Unload p2 and p1. (two separate unload actions)
10. Load p2 onto a2.
11. Load p1 onto a2.
12. Fly to l1_1.
13. Unload p1.
14. Unload p2.
15. Drive t1 to l1_1.
16. Load p2.
17. Drive to l1_4.
18. Unload p2.

That's 18 steps. But unloading both p2 and p1 would require two separate unload steps (9a and 9b). Similarly, loading requires two steps (10 and 11). So total steps would be:

1. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
2. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
3. Drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
4. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
5. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
6. Drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2
7. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
8. Drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
9. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
10. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
11. Loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
12. Loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
13. Flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
14. Unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
15. Unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
16. Drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
17. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
18. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
19. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

So that's 19 steps. But in this case, step4 meets the constraint. But does this plan work?

Wait, after step3, t2 is in l2_3 with p2 loaded. Then step4 unloads p2 into l2_3 (constraint met). Then step5 loads p2 back into t2. Then drive to l2_5 (step6), load p1 (step7). Then drive to l2_1 (step8). Then steps9 and10 unload both p2 and p1 into l2_1. Then steps11 and12 load them onto a2. Then fly.

This seems feasible. So steps 1-19. But let's count again:

1. Drive t2 to l2_2.
2. Load p2.
3. Drive to l2_3.
4. Unload p2. (constraint met)
5. Load p2.
6. Drive to l2_5.
7. Load p1.
8. Drive to l2_1.
9. Unload p2.
10. Unload p1.
11. Load p2 onto a2.
12. Load p1 onto a2.
13. Fly to l1_1.
14. Unload p1.
15. Unload p2.
16. Drive t1 to l1_1.
17. Load p2.
18. Drive to l1_4.
19. Unload p2.

Yes, 19 steps. But the previous plan had 20. So this is shorter by one step. But is this valid?

Yes, because after step4, p2 is in l2_3, meeting the constraint. Then steps5-12 handle both packages. This seems better.

But wait, in step6, driving from l2_3 to l2_5: is that allowed? Yes, because both are in c2.

So this plan meets the constraint and is shorter. So this is better.

Now, check if this is optimal. Could we do it even shorter?

Let's see. For example, after step3 (drive to l2_3), unload p2 (step4), then instead of reloading p2, leave it there. But then we have to pick it up again. But that would require more steps. Alternatively, is there a way to avoid reloading p2? No, because we need to get it to the airport.

Alternatively, maybe we can have a2 make two trips, but that would require more steps. So probably not.

Alternatively, can we load p1 first and then p2? Not sure. But the current plan seems efficient.

Another optimization: when unloading p1 and p2 at l2_1 (steps9 and10), perhaps combine them into a single action. But each unload is per package, so two steps are needed.

Similarly, loading both packages onto a2 requires two separate load actions.

So the plan has 19 steps, which may be the minimal required.

But let's think again. Let's see if there's a way to have the constraint met without adding extra steps. For example, in the initial plan where p2 is moved directly from l2_2 to l2_1, but that doesn't meet the constraint. But perhaps if we can meet the constraint through p1's transportation.

Wait, p1 is in l2_5. To get to l1_1, it's transported via t2 and a2. Is there a way to have p1 pass through l1_2? For example, after arriving in l1_1, load it into t1 and drive to l1_2, then unload (meeting the constraint), then drive back to l1_1. But that adds steps and the goal is already achieved, so we can't.

Alternatively, maybe during the transportation of p1, use a different airplane. But a1 is in l1_1, so it's in c1. To fly a1 to c2, we need to fly it to l2_1. But initial location of a1 is l1_1. So:

Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1, load p1 and p2, fly back. But that would involve more steps.

Alternatively, use a2 to fly to l1_1, then a1 to fly elsewhere. But not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps use the truck t1 in c1 to move p2 from l1_1 to l1_4 via l1_2, so that during that movement, p2 is in l1_2. But no, because p2 is in the truck, not the location.

Wait, the constraint is that in at least one state, p1 is in l1_2 or p2 is in l2_3. So if during the movement of p2 from l1_1 to l1_4 via t1, t1 passes through l1_2, but p2 is in the truck, which is in l1_2. Does that count? No, because the package is in the truck, not the location. So the only way is to have the package unloaded in the location.

Thus, the only way to meet the constraint is to have p2 unloaded in l2_3 or p1 unloaded in l1_2. The plan where p2 is unloaded in l2_3 (step4) meets it.

So the earlier plan with 19 steps seems valid and meets the constraint. Now, check if it's optimal.

Can we combine any steps?

For example, steps9 and10 are two unloads. They can't be combined. Similarly, steps11 and12 are two loads.

Alternatively, perhaps when flying, the airplane can carry both packages, but loading and unloading are separate actions.

Hmm. So I think the 19-step plan is the best possible. But let's count again:

1. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
2. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
3. Drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2

Yes, 19 steps. Now, is there a way to reduce this?

Wait, steps9 and10: after driving to l2_1, unload both p2 and p1. But perhaps we can unload them in one step? No, because each unload is per package. So two steps are necessary.

Similarly, loading both packages onto a2 requires two steps.

Flying once is optimal.

Then moving t1 once to l1_1, load p2, drive to l1_4.

This seems minimal.

Alternatively, can we load p1 and p2 onto a2 in a different order? Doesn't matter, still two steps.

Another thought: After step5, t2 is in l2_3 with p2 loaded. Then drive to l2_5 (step6), load p1 (step7). Then drive back to l2_1 (step8). Then unload both. But this is the same.

Alternatively, when t2 is at l2_5 after step7, could we unload p2 there? No, because p2 is in the truck. To unload p2, the truck must be in a location. But we need to get both packages to l2_1.

Hmm. I think this is the minimal plan. Let's proceed with this.
