Let me analyze the problem and come up with a solution.

First, let's understand the initial state:
- We have two cities, c1 and c2, each with 5 locations.
- l1_1 is an airport in city c1
- l2_1 is an airport in city c2
- Package p1 is initially at location l2_5 (in city c2)
- Package p2 is initially at location l2_2 (in city c2)
- Truck t1 is initially at location l1_2 (in city c1)
- Truck t2 is initially at location l2_1 (in city c2)
- Airplane a1 is initially at location l1_1 (airport in city c1)
- Airplane a2 is initially at location l2_1 (airport in city c2)

The goal is to bring about:
- Package p1 is in location l1_1
- Package p2 is in location l1_4

Additionally, there's a constraint that at some point during the plan, at least one of the following must be true:
- Package p1 is in location l1_2
- Package p2 is in location l2_3

Let's start planning:

For p1:
1. We need to move p1 from l2_5 to l1_1.
2. Since p1 is in city c2 and needs to go to city c1, it needs to travel by air.
3. We need to use truck t2 to transport p1 from l2_5 to the airport l2_1.
4. Then we use airplane a2 (or a1 if a1 flies to l2_1) to transport p1 to l1_1.

For p2:
1. We need to move p2 from l2_2 to l1_4.
2. Since p2 is in city c2 and needs to go to city c1, it needs to travel by air.
3. We need to use truck t2 to transport p2 from l2_2 to the airport l2_1.
4. Then we use airplane a2 (or a1 if a1 flies to l2_1) to transport p2 to l1_1.
5. Finally, we use truck t1 to transport p2 from l1_1 to l1_4.

Regarding the constraint, we have to ensure that at some point either:
- p1 is in l1_2 (which is not directly on its optimal path)
- p2 is in l2_3 (which is not directly on its optimal path)

To minimize actions, we should choose the option that requires the least deviation from the optimal path. Let's evaluate:

1. For p1 to be in l1_2:
   After flying to l1_1, we would need to load p1 onto t1 (which starts at l1_2), drive to l1_2, unload, then load again, drive back to l1_1, and unload.

2. For p2 to be in l2_3:
   After loading p2 onto t2 at l2_2, we would drive to l2_3, unload, then load again, and drive to l2_1.

Option 2 seems to involve fewer detours, so let's go with that.

Let me now provide a detailed plan:

For p1:
1. Drive truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_5
2. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_5
3. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1
4. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1
5. Load p1 onto airplane a2 at l2_1
6. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1
7. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1 (Goal for p1 achieved)

For p2:
1. Drive truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_2
2. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_2
3. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_3 (to satisfy the constraint)
4. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_3 (Constraint satisfied)
5. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_3
6. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1
7. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1
8. Load p2 onto airplane a2 at l2_1
9. Fly a2 from l1_1 to l2_1
10. Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1
11. Drive truck t1 from l1_2 to l1_1
12. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_1
13. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_4
14. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_4 (Goal for p2 achieved)

Actually, there's a logical issue with this plan. After flying a2 from l2_1 to l1_1, a2 will already be at l1_1, not l2_1. 

Let me revise the plan:

For p1:
1. Drive truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_5
2. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_5
3. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1
4. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1
5. Load p1 onto airplane a2 at l2_1
6. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1
7. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1 (Goal for p1 achieved)

For p2:
1. Drive truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_2
2. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_2
3. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_3 (to satisfy the constraint)
4. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_3 (Constraint satisfied)
5. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_3
6. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1
7. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1
8. Fly a2 from l1_1 back to l2_1
9. Load p2 onto a2 at l2_1
10. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1
11. Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1
12. Drive truck t1 from l1_2 to l1_1
13. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_1
14. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_4
15. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_4 (Goal for p2 achieved)

Hmm, I see more issues. Let's carefully revise the plan.

Let's also consider the possibility of using a1 for flying packages, as it might reduce the number of flights.

Wait, there's a misunderstanding in the initial state. Let me re-read it:

"Package t1 is in location l1_2"
"Package t2 is in location l2_1"
"Package p1 is in location l2_5"
"Package p2 is in location l2_2"
"Package a1 is in location l1_1"
"Package a2 is in location l2_1"

This is clearly a mistake; t1, t2, a1, and a2 are not packages, they are respectively trucks and airplanes. Let me correct this understanding:

- Truck t1 is initially at location l1_2 (in city c1)
- Truck t2 is initially at location l2_1 (in city c2)
- Package p1 is initially at location l2_5 (in city c2)
- Package p2 is initially at location l2_2 (in city c2)
- Airplane a1 is initially at location l1_1 (airport in city c1)
- Airplane a2 is initially at location l2_1 (airport in city c2)

Now let's revise our plan. There are two cities, c1 and c2, and we need to move packages between them using trucks within cities and airplanes between cities.

I think we should use a2 for both packages since it's already at l2_1, and it would be inefficient to fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1 just to pick up a package.

Let's create a new plan:

1. Drive truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_5
2. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_5
3. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2
4. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_2
5. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_2
6. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_3
7. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_3 (Constraint satisfied: p2 is in l2_3)
8. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_3
9. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1
10. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1
11. Load p2 onto a2 at l2_1
12. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1
13. Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1
14. Drive truck t1 from l1_2 to l1_1
15. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_1
16. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_4
17. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_4 (Goal for p2 achieved)
18. Fly a2 from l1_1 to l2_1
19. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_2
20. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1
21. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1
22. Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1
23. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1
24. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1 (Goal for p1 achieved)

Hmm, this plan has some issues. After unloading p1 from t2 at l2_2 (step 4), we never load it back onto a truck, yet in step 19 we assume it's back on t2. Let me redo this to ensure everything is consistent:

1. Drive truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_5
2. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_5
3. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2
4. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_2
5. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_3
6. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_3 (Constraint satisfied: p2 is in l2_3)
7. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_3
8. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1
9. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1
10. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1
11. Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1
12. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1
13. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1 (Goal for p1 achieved)
14. Fly a2 from l1_1 to l2_1
15. Load p2 onto a2 at l2_1
16. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1
17. Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1
18. Drive truck t1 from l1_2 to l1_1
19. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_1
20. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_4
21. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_4 (Goal for p2 achieved)

Wait, I just realized that in step 4, I need to unload p1 from t2 before loading p2. Let me correct the plan:

1. Drive truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_5
2. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_5
3. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2
4. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_2
5. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_2
6. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_3
7. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_3 (Constraint satisfied: p2 is in l2_3)
8. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_3
9. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1
10. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1
11. Load p2 onto a2 at l2_1
12. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1
13. Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1
14. Drive truck t1 from l1_2 to l1_1
15. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_1
16. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_4
17. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_4 (Goal for p2 achieved)
18. Fly a2 from l1_1 to l2_1
19. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2
20. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_2
21. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1
22. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1
23. Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1
24. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1
25. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1 (Goal for p1 achieved)

Ok, this plan looks consistent. Let's double-check:
- It achieves the goal of having p1 at l1_1 and p2 at l1_4.
- It satisfies the constraint by having p2 at l2_3 at one point.
- All action preconditions are met, and effects are properly accounted for.

However, I'm still not fully satisfied with the efficiency. Let's try to optimize further.

I'm wondering if instead of satisfying the constraint with p2 at l2_3, we could satisfy it with p1 at l1_2. This might lead to a more efficient plan.

Alternative plan:

1. Drive truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_5
2. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_5
3. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1
4. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1
5. Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1
6. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1
7. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1 (p1 at l1_1, partly goal achieved)
8. Drive truck t1 from l1_2 to l1_1
9. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_1
10. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_2
11. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_2 (Constraint satisfied: p1 is in l1_2)
12. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_2
13. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1
14. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1 (Goal for p1 achieved)
15. Fly a2 from l1_1 to l2_1
16. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2
17. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_2
18. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1
19. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1
20. Load p2 onto a2 at l2_1
21. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1
22. Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1
23. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_1
24. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_4
25. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_4 (Goal for p2 achieved)

This alternative plan has the same number of steps, but it might be less efficient in terms of truck movement. Let's try a different approach where we handle both packages together more efficiently:

1. Drive truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_2
2. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_2
3. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_5
4. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_5
5. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_3
6. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_3 (Constraint satisfied: p2 is in l2_3)
7. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_3
8. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1
9. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1
10. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1
11. Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1
12. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1
13. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1 (Goal for p1 achieved)
14. Fly a2 from l1_1 to l2_1
15. Load p2 onto a2 at l2_1
16. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1
17. Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1
18. Drive truck t1 from l1_2 to l1_1
19. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_1
20. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_4
21. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_4 (Goal for p2 achieved)

This plan seems more efficient, requiring 21 steps instead of 25. Let's check it one more time:
- It achieves the goal of having p1 at l1_1 and p2 at l1_4.
- It satisfies the constraint by having p2 at l2_3 at one point.
- All action preconditions are met, and effects are properly accounted for.

However, I'm still wondering if there's an even more efficient plan. Let's explore the option of using a1, which is already at l1_1:

1. Drive truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_2
2. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_2
3. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_5
4. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_5
5. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_3
6. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_3 (Constraint satisfied: p2 is in l2_3)
7. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_3
8. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1
9. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1
10. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1
11. Fly airplane a1 from l1_1 to l2_1
12. Load p1 onto a1 at l2_1
13. Load p2 onto a1 at l2_1
14. Fly a1 from l2_1 to l1_1
15. Unload p1 from a1 at l1_1 (Goal for p1 achieved)
16. Unload p2 from a1 at l1_1
17. Drive truck t1 from l1_2 to l1_1
18. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_1
19. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_4
20. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_4 (Goal for p2 achieved)

This plan is even more efficient, requiring 20 steps. Let's check it:
- It achieves the goal of having p1 at l1_1 and p2 at l1_4.
- It satisfies the constraint by having p2 at l2_3 at one point.
- All action preconditions are met, and effects are properly accounted for.

I think this is the most efficient plan so far, so I'll go with it. For clarity and to ensure it's correct, let me rewrite the actions in the exact format specified:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
4. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
5. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_3 c2
6. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
7. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
8. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
9. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
10. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
11. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
12. loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
13. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
14. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
15. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
16. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
17. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
18. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
19. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
20. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

I made a mistake in the action name "loadairplane" for unloading. The correct action name is "unloadairplane". Let me correct the plan:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
4. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
5. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_3 c2
6. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
7. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
8. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
9. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
10. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
11. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
12. loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
13. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
14. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
15. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
16. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
17. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
18. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
19. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
20. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

Actually, I made another error in my understanding. In the initial setup, it says "unloadairplane p ap l", but then describes the action as "loadairplane p ap l". The correct action should be "unloadairplane". Let me correct this:

The actions for this domain are:
1. loadtruck p t l
2. loadairplane p ap l
3. unloadtruck p t l
4. unloadairplane p ap l
5. drivetruck t l_from l_to c
6. flyairplane ap l_from l_to

With that clarification, the plan is correct as written.

Let me check if there's another issue with our plan: if we drive from l2_5 to l2_3, we might pass through l2_2, which might not be allowed. Let's check the problem description again...

The description doesn't specify a map or connectivity between locations, so I'll assume we can drive directly between any two locations within the same city. With that assumption, our plan is valid.

Let's double-check that it achieves the goal and satisfies the constraint:
- Goal: p1 is at l1_1 (achieved in step 15) and p2 is at l1_4 (achieved in step 20).
- Constraint: At some point, either p1 is at l1_2 or p2 is at l2_3. This is satisfied in step 6 when p2 is unloaded at l2_3.

The plan is optimal in terms of steps. We satisfy the constraint with a minimal detour, and we transport both packages efficiently.

Here's the final plan:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
4. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
5. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_3 c2
6. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
7. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
8. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
9. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
10. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
11. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
12. loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
13. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
14. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
15. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
16. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
17. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
18. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
19. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
20. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
