Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. Hmm, so the goal is to get p1 to l2_5 and p2 to l1_2. But there's a constraint that at some point, p2 must be in a2 and p1 in l1_2. Let me start by understanding the initial state and the required steps.

First, the initial state: Locations are divided into cities. For c1, we have l1_1 (airport), l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5. Similarly for c2. The packages: p1 is in l2_3 (c2), p2 is in l1_1 (c1). Trucks t1 is in l1_2 (c1), t2 in l2_4 (c2). Airplanes a1 is in l1_1 (c1's airport), a2 in l2_1 (c2's airport).

The goal is p1 at l2_5 (c2) and p2 at l1_2 (c1). The constraint requires that at some state, p2 is in a2 and p1 is in l1_2. Wait, l1_2 is in c1. But p1 starts in l2_3 (c2). So how does p1 get to l1_2? That seems to require moving p1 from c2 to c1. Which probably involves an airplane. Let's see.

So to get p1 to l1_2, we need to transport it from c2 to c1. Let's think: p1 is in l2_3. Maybe use truck t2 (in l2_4) to drive to l2_3, load p1 into t2, drive to l2_1 (airport), unload p1 there. Then load it onto airplane a2 (since a2 is at l2_1 initially). Wait, but a2 starts at l2_1. Then fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1 (c1's airport). Then unload p1 from a2 at l1_1. Then load it onto truck t1 (which is at l1_2? Wait, t1 is in l1_2 initially. So to get t1 to l1_1, we need to drive it from l1_2 to l1_1. Then load p1 into t1, drive back to l1_2, and unload. That would satisfy the constraint that p1 is in l1_2 at some point. But also, during this process, p2 needs to be in a2. How?

Wait, the constraint says that in at least one state, both p2 is in a2 and p1 is in l1_2. So maybe we need to have p2 loaded into a2 while p1 is in l1_2. Let's see.

But p2 starts in l1_1. So maybe we can have p2 loaded into a1 (which is at l1_1), then fly a1 to l2_1, unload p2, then load it into a2. Wait, but a2 is at l2_1. Wait, but a2 starts at l2_1. So if p2 is loaded into a2 at l2_1, then that would place it in a2. But how does p2 get to l2_1? Because it's starting in l1_1. So perhaps fly a1 (starting at l1_1) with p2 to l2_1. Let's see:

First, load p2 into a1 at l1_1. Then fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1. Then unload p2 at l2_1. Then load p2 into a2 at l2_1. That would put p2 into a2. So during this process, after loading p2 into a2, it's in a2. Then, when would p1 be in l1_2? Let's say after transporting p1 to l1_2 via truck t1. So if these two happen in the plan, the constraint is met when both are true at the same time.

But the order matters. Let's outline the steps for both packages.

For p1: Starting in l2_3 (c2). Need to get to l2_5. But the goal is l2_5. Wait, the goal is p1 in l2_5 (c2) and p2 in l1_2 (c1). Wait, p1 starts in c2. So maybe the constraint requires moving p1 to l1_2 (c1), which is part of the intermediate step. But how?

Wait, the constraint says that in at least one state, p1 is in l1_2 and p2 is in a2. So p1 must be moved to l1_2 at some point, even though the final goal is to have it in l2_5. Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, the final goal is p1 in l2_5 and p2 in l1_2. But the constraint requires that at some point, p1 is in l1_2 (which is in c1) and p2 is in a2. So how does p1 get to l1_2 and then back to c2?

That complicates things. So maybe the plan is to first move p1 to l1_2 (satisfying the constraint), then move it back to c2's l2_5. But that seems inefficient. Let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps during the transportation of p1 from l2_3 to l2_5, we can have a detour where p1 is moved to l1_2, then back. But that would require moving between cities, which requires airplanes.

Let me outline the steps for p2. p2 needs to end up in l1_2 (c1). It starts in l1_1. So maybe load p2 into a1, fly to l2_1, unload, load into a2, fly to l1_1 again? Wait, but a2 can only fly between airports. So perhaps p2 is taken from l1_1 (c1) to l2_1 (c2) via a1, then loaded into a2, then flown back to l1_1? But why? Because the constraint requires that p2 is in a2 at some point. So loading p2 into a2 would satisfy that. But how does p2 get into a2? Since a2 is in l2_1 (c2). So p2 needs to be moved to l2_1. Then loaded into a2. Then perhaps moved back to c1.

But the final destination of p2 is l1_2 (c1). So after moving p2 into a2 (at l2_1), we need to fly a2 to l1_1, unload p2, then use a truck to take it to l1_2. Wait, but a2 can't fly to l1_1 unless it's an airport. Which it is. So that's possible.

But let's think step by step.

First, moving p2 from l1_1 to a2:

1. Load p2 into a1 at l1_1 (since a1 is there). Action: loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1.

2. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1. Action: flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1.

3. Unload p2 from a1 at l2_1. Action: unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1.

4. Load p2 into a2 at l2_1. Action: loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1. Now p2 is in a2, satisfying part of the constraint.

At this point, the constraint requires p1 to be in l1_2. So how does p1 get there? Let's look at p1's path.

p1 starts in l2_3 (c2). To get to l1_2 (c1), we need to move it from c2 to c1. So steps:

5. Drive truck t2 (which is in l2_4) to l2_3. Action: drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2.

6. Load p1 into t2. Action: loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3.

7. Drive t2 to l2_1 (airport of c2). Action: drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2. Wait, but can a truck drive between l2_3 and l2_1? Since both are in c2, yes.

Wait, initial locations: t2 is in l2_4. So steps: drive from l2_4 to l2_3 (load p1), then drive to l2_1 (airport). Then unload p1 at l2_1.

Wait, but if we want to load p1 into a2 (which is at l2_1), then fly a2 to l1_1. Then unload p1 at l1_1, then use truck t1 (which is in l1_2) to drive to l1_1, load p1, drive back to l1_2. Then unload. That would get p1 to l1_2, satisfying the constraint.

So let's continue the steps:

After step 7, p1 is in t2 at l2_1.

8. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1. Action: unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1.

9. Load p1 into a2. Action: loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1.

10. Fly a2 to l1_1. Action: flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

11. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1. Action: unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1.

12. Now, need to get p1 to l1_2. So drive truck t1 (which is in l1_2) to l1_1. Wait, can't load unless the truck is there. So:

12. Drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1.

13. Load p1 into t1. Action: loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1.

14. Drive back to l1_2. Action: drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1.

15. Unload p1 into l1_2. Action: unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2. Now p1 is in l1_2, which is part of the constraint.

At this point, the constraint is met: p2 is in a2 (from step 4) and p1 is in l1_2 (step 15). But wait, steps 4 and 15 are not happening at the same time. Because step 4 is before step 15. So between step 4 and step 15, p2 is in a2. But p1 is only in l1_2 after step 15. So the state after step 15 has p1 in l1_2 and p2 in a2 (if step 4 hasn't been altered). Wait, but after step 4, p2 is in a2. Then, in step 5 to 15, p2 is still in a2. Unless we unload it. Because we need to eventually get p2 to l1_2.

Wait, p2's final destination is l1_2. So after step 4, p2 is in a2 at l2_1. Then, we need to get it to l1_2. So steps after step 4:

16. Fly a2 (with p2 and p1?) Wait, no. After step 10, a2 is in l1_1. Wait, in step 10, a2 flies to l1_1, carrying p1 (step 9-10). Then in step 11, p1 is unloaded from a2 into l1_1. So a2 is now empty. But p2 was loaded into a2 in step 4, but then after step 10, a2 is in l1_1, but was p2 in a2? No, because step 4 was loading p2 into a2 at l2_1, then step 10 is flying a2 from l2_1 to l1_1. So during that flight, a2 would be carrying p2 (from step 4) and p1 (from step 9)? No, because step 9 is loading p1 into a2. Wait, steps 4: p2 is loaded into a2. Then step 9: p1 is loaded into a2. So a2 would have both packages? The problem statement doesn't mention any limits on capacity, so that's possible. But when you load p1 into a2, p2 is already there. So after step 9, a2 has both p1 and p2. Then flying a2 to l1_1 (step 10). Then in step 11, unload p1. But p2 is still in a2. So after step 11, a2 is in l1_1 with p2. Then, to get p2 to l1_2, unload p2 from a2 into l1_1 (but a2 is at l1_1). Then use truck t1 (after driving back from l1_1 to l1_2) to carry p2.

Wait, let's retrace. After step 4: p2 is in a2 at l2_1. Then steps 5-15 involve moving p1 into a2 (step 9), flying to l1_1 (step 10), unloading p1 (step 11). So after step 11, a2 is in l1_1, with p2 still in it (since we loaded p2 in step 4 and never unloaded). Then, we need to unload p2 from a2 in l1_1. So:

16. Unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1. Then p2 is in l1_1.

17. Then drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1 (again?), load p2, drive back to l1_2, unload. But t1 was already driven back to l1_2 in step 14. So:

17. Drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1.

18. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

19. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1.

20. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2.

This would get p2 to l1_2. But this adds several steps. However, the constraint requires that at some point, p2 is in a2 and p1 is in l1_2. Let's see when that happens. After step 15, p1 is in l1_2. But after step 11, a2 is in l1_1 with p2. So in the state after step 11, p2 is in a2 (since a2 is in l1_1 and p2 is inside it). Wait, no. After step 4, p2 is loaded into a2. Then step 9 loads p1 into a2. Then step 10 flies a2 to l1_1. Then step 11 unloads p1 from a2, leaving p2 still in a2. So after step 11, a2 is in l1_1, with p2 inside. So p2 is in a2 (which is at l1_1). Then, after step 15, p1 is in l1_2. So between step 11 and step 16 (unloading p2 from a2), the state has p2 in a2 (at l1_1) and p1 in l1_2 (after step 15). So that would satisfy the constraint.

But wait, step 15 is after step 11. So after step 15, the state is: p1 in l1_2, and p2 in a2 (still in l1_1). So that's the state where both conditions hold. Therefore, the constraint is satisfied.

Now, the problem is that after step 15, we need to move p1 from l1_2 back to c2's l2_5, but the goal is p1 in l2_5. So we need to transport p1 from l1_2 to l2_5. How?

So after step 15, p1 is in l1_2. So steps to move it back:

21. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1 (again). Load p1 into a1 (which is at l1_1). Then fly a1 to l2_1. Unload p1, load into t2, drive to l2_5.

But that's a lot of steps. Let's think.

Alternatively, after step 15, p1 is in l1_2. We need to get it to l2_5. So steps:

21. Load p1 into t1 (which is at l1_2). Action: loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2.

22. Drive t1 to l1_1. Action: drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1.

23. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1. Action: unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1.

24. Load p1 into a1. Action: loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1.

25. Fly a1 to l2_1. Action: flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1.

26. Unload p1 from a1. Action: unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1.

27. Load p1 into t2. Action: loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1.

28. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_5. Action: drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2.

29. Unload p1 into l2_5. Action: unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5.

That would achieve the goal for p1.

But this seems very long. Let's check the total steps. From the initial steps for p2 and the steps for p1, this plan would have around 29 steps. But maybe there's a more optimal way.

Wait, let's see if there's a way to avoid moving p1 all the way to l1_2 and then back. Because the constraint requires that p1 is in l1_2 at some point. But the final goal is l2_5. So perhaps after satisfying the constraint, p1 is moved back to c2.

But the constraint requires that in at least one state, both p2 is in a2 and p1 is in l1_2. So as long as that's true at some point, even if p1 is moved later, it's okay.

But the problem says the plan must be optimal (as short as possible). So maybe there's a way to have the constraint met during the transportation of p1 and p2 without backtracking.

Alternative approach: Let's try to find a way where p1 is moved to l1_2 as part of the plan, and p2 is loaded into a2, but without unnecessary steps.

Wait, p2's final destination is l1_2. So maybe after loading p2 into a2, we fly a2 to l1_1, unload p2, then use truck t1 to drive to l1_1, load p2, drive to l1_2. But how does p2 get into a2?

So steps for p2:

1. Load p2 into a1 at l1_1.

2. Fly a1 to l2_1.

3. Unload p2 into l2_1.

4. Load p2 into a2 at l2_1. Now, p2 is in a2.

Then fly a2 to l1_1.

5. Fly a2 l2_1 l1_1.

6. Unload p2 from a2 into l1_1.

7. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1.

8. Load p2 into t1.

9. Drive back to l1_2.

10. Unload p2. This gets p2 to l1_2.

Now, during step 4, p2 is in a2 (at l2_1). When does p1 get to l1_2?

For p1, starting in l2_3. Need to get to l2_5. Also, during the plan, p1 must be in l1_2.

So maybe, after step 4 (p2 in a2), we need to get p1 to l1_2.

So:

11. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_3.

12. Load p1 into t2.

13. Drive t2 to l2_1.

14. Unload p1 into l2_1.

15. Load p1 into a2 (which is at l2_1? Wait, no. After step 5, a2 is flown to l1_1. So this approach might not work. Wait, steps 1-5: a2 is flown to l1_1 in step 5, but then steps 11-14 would be moving p1 to l2_1 where a2 is not present. Hmm. Maybe another approach.

Alternatively, after step 4 (p2 in a2 at l2_1), fly a2 to l1_1 (step 5), then unload p2 (step 6), but also fly a2 back to l2_1 later to load p1.

Wait, this seems complicated. Let me think again.

Another idea: After p2 is in a2 (step 4), fly a2 to l1_1 (step 5), unload p2 (step 6), then fly a2 back to l2_1 (step 7). Then use a2 to transport p1 from l2_1 to l2_5's city. Wait, but l2_5 is in c2, so maybe use a truck.

Alternatively, perhaps using a different airplane. Let's see.

Alternatively, after step 4 (p2 in a2 at l2_1), we can fly a2 to l1_1 (step 5). But during this flight, a2 is carrying p2. Then, unload p2 into l1_1 (step 6). Then drive t1 to l1_1, load p2, drive to l1_2 (steps 7-10). Now p2 is at l1_2. Then, p1 needs to go to l2_5.

For p1, starting at l2_3. Use truck t2 (in l2_4) to drive to l2_3 (step 11), load p1 (step 12), drive to l2_5 (step 13), unload (step 14). That would be efficient. But how to get the constraint met. Because the constraint requires p1 to be in l1_2 and p2 in a2 at the same time.

But in this approach, p2 is in a2 only during steps 4-5 (from loading into a2 at l2_1 to flying to l1_1 and unloading). But when is p1 in l1_2? In this approach, p1 is never moved to l1_2, which violates the constraint. So this approach won't work.

So back to the original plan where p1 is moved to l1_2.

So the steps would involve moving p1 to l1_2, then back to c2. But that's a lot of steps. Let's see if there's a smarter way.

Wait, what if we load p1 into a2 at l2_1, then fly a2 to l1_1, unload p1 there, then use truck t1 to drive to l1_1, load p1, drive to l1_2. Then p1 is in l1_2. Also, during this time, p2 is in a2 (loaded at step 4). So when a2 is at l1_1, p2 is still in a2 until step 6 (unload). So during the time after step 4 (p2 in a2) and before step 6 (unload p2 from a2), if p1 is in l1_2, then the constraint is met.

But how to get p1 into l1_2 during that window.

Let me outline:

Steps for p2:

1. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

2. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

3. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

4. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (now p2 is in a2)

Steps for p1 to reach l1_2:

5. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2

6. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

7. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

8. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

9. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

10. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

11. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

12. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1

13. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

14. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1

15. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 (now p1 is in l1_2)

At this point, after step 15, p1 is in l1_2, and p2 is still in a2 (which was flown to l1_1 in step 10). So in the state after step 10 (a2 is in l1_1 with p1 and p2 inside), then after unloading p1 (step 11), p2 is still in a2. Then after step 15, p1 is in l1_2. So between step 11 and step 16 (unloading p2 from a2), the state would have p2 in a2 and p1 in l1_2. So the constraint is satisfied.

Then, steps to move p2 to l1_2:

16. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

17. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 (again)

18. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

19. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1

20. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (p2 now at goal)

Steps to move p1 to l2_5:

21. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1

22. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

23. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1 (Wait, this doesn't help. Maybe use a different approach.)

Wait, after step 15, p1 is in l1_2. To get to l2_5, we need to transport it back to c2.

So:

21. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2

22. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1

23. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

24. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

25. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

26. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

27. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

28. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2

29. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

This adds many steps. But the problem requires an optimal plan, so we need to find the shortest possible.

Is there a way to combine some steps?

Alternative approach:

After step 15, p1 is in l1_2 (constraint met), p2 is in a2 at l1_1. Then, unload p2 from a2 into l1_1 (step 16). Then use truck t1 to move p2 to l1_2 (steps 17-20). Now, p2 is at goal.

For p1, after being in l1_2 (step 15), need to get to l2_5. So:

21. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2

22. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1

23. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

24. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

25. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

26. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

27. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

28. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2

29. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

So total steps: 29. But this seems too long. Maybe there's a more optimal way.

Wait, perhaps using airplane a2 to carry both p1 and p2 at the same time. For example, after loading p2 into a2 (step 4), load p1 into a2 (step 9), fly to l1_1 (step 10), unload both. Then move p1 to l1_2 and p2 to l1_2 as well. But how?

Alternatively, after flying a2 to l1_1 (step 10), unload p1 and p2. Then p2 is in l1_1, which can be moved to l1_2 with truck t1, and p1 is also in l1_1, which can be moved to l1_2, but then p1 needs to go back to c2. So this might not save steps.

Alternatively, perhaps after step 15 (p1 in l1_2), we can fly a2 back to l2_1, then use it to transport p1 to c2. But this requires:

16. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1

17. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

18. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l2_5 (but l2_5 isn't an airport. Only airports are l1_1 and l2_1. So can't fly to l2_5. So need to use a truck in c2 to move from l2_1 to l2_5.

So steps:

16. fly a2 from l1_1 to l2_1 (carrying p2)

17. unload p2 from a2 into l2_1 (but p2 needs to be in l1_2, so this is not helpful). Wait, maybe this is not the right path.

Hmm. This is getting complicated. Let's try to outline the minimal steps.

Possible optimal plan:

1. Load p2 into a1 at l1_1.

2. Fly a1 to l2_1.

3. Unload p2 at l2_1.

4. Load p2 into a2 at l2_1. (Now p2 is in a2)

5. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_3.

6. Load p1 into t2.

7. Drive t2 to l2_1.

8. Unload p1 at l2_1.

9. Load p1 into a2. (Now a2 has p1 and p2)

10. Fly a2 to l1_1.

11. Unload p1 from a2 into l1_1.

12. Unload p2 from a2 into l1_1. (Now p2 is in l1_1, p1 is in l1_1)

13. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1.

14. Load p2 into t1.

15. Drive t1 to l1_2.

16. Unload p2. (p2 is at goal)

17. Load p1 into t1.

18. Drive t1 to l1_1.

19. Load p1 into a1.

20. Fly a1 to l2_1.

21. Unload p1.

22. Load p1 into t2.

23. Drive t2 to l2_5.

24. Unload p1. (p1 at goal)

But this requires 24 steps. However, in this plan, when is p1 in l1_2? After step 17, p1 is loaded into t1 at l1_1, then driven to l1_2 (step 18?), but no, step 17 is load p1 into t1 (which is at l1_1), then drive to l1_2. Wait, steps:

After step 16: p2 is unloaded at l1_2. Then step 17: load p1 into t1 (t1 is at l1_2). But p1 is in l1_1. So step 17 is not possible unless t1 is at l1_1. So steps may need adjustment.

Alternatively, after step 16 (p2 is in l1_2), to move p1 from l1_1 to l1_2:

17. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1.

18. Load p1 into t1.

19. Drive back to l1_2.

20. Unload p1. (Now p1 is in l1_2, meeting the constraint)

But then p1 needs to go to l2_5. So:

21. Load p1 into t1.

22. Drive to l1_1.

23. Load into a1.

24. Fly to l2_1.

25. Unload.

26. Load into t2.

27. Drive to l2_5.

28. Unload.

This makes the plan even longer.

I think the initial approach where the constraint is met during the transportation of p1 to l1_2 and p2 in a2 is unavoidable, even if it adds steps. But how to make this optimal.

Wait, perhaps there's a way to have p1 in l1_2 and p2 in a2 in the same step. For example, when a2 is at l1_1 with p2, and p1 is unloaded into l1_2. But how?

Let me think again:

- p2 is loaded into a2 at l2_1 (step 4).

- a2 flies to l1_1 (step 10), carrying p2 and p1 (if p1 was loaded into a2 at l2_1).

- Then, unload p1 into l1_1 (step 11), and p2 remains in a2.

- Then, drive t1 to l1_1, load p2, drive to l1_2, unload (steps 12-15). At this point, p2 is in l1_2, and p1 is in l1_1.

- Then, load p1 into t1, drive to l1_2, unload (steps 16-18). Now p1 is in l1_2. But during this time, p2 was already unloaded from a2, so a2 no longer has p2. So the constraint (p2 in a2 and p1 in l1_2) is not met.

Hmm. This suggests that the only way to satisfy the constraint is to have p1 in l1_2 while p2 is in a2. So perhaps during the time when a2 is at l1_1 with p2 inside, and p1 is moved to l1_2.

So after step 10 (a2 at l1_1 with p2 inside), unload p1 (step 11), then drive t1 to l1_1 (step 12), load p1, drive to l1_2 (steps 13-14), unload p1 (step 15). During this time, p2 is still in a2 (since we haven't unloaded it yet). So after step 15, p1 is in l1_2 and p2 is in a2 (at l1_1). Then, step 16 would unload p2 from a2 into l1_1, and proceed to move it to l1_2.

So steps 1-15 would satisfy the constraint. Then steps 16-20 for p2, and 21-29 for p1.

But this is lengthy. However, given the constraints, this might be the only way. So the optimal plan would have to include these steps.

But perhaps there's a shorter way. Let me think differently.

What if we use a different airplane for p1? For example, after moving p1 to l2_1, load into a1 and fly to l1_1, then use truck to move to l1_2. But how does that affect the constraint?

Alternatively, after p1 is in l1_2, we can fly a2 (with p2) back to l2_1, unload p2, then use truck t2 to move p2 to l2_5. Wait, but p2's goal is l1_2. So that's not applicable.

Wait, no. The goal for p2 is l1_2. So p2 must end up there. So all steps involving p2 must end with it in l1_2.

Given that, perhaps the minimal plan is as follows:

For p2:

1. Load p2 into a1 at l1_1.

2. Fly a1 to l2_1.

3. Unload p2.

4. Load p2 into a2 at l2_1.

5. Fly a2 to l1_1.

6. Unload p2 into l1_1.

7. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1.

8. Load p2 into t1.

9. Drive to l1_2.

10. Unload p2. (Now p2 is at goal)

For p1:

11. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_3.

12. Load p1 into t2.

13. Drive to l2_1.

14. Unload p1.

15. Load into a2 (which is at l2_1? But after step 5, a2 is at l1_1. So this won't work. So perhaps use a different airplane.

Wait, after step 5, a2 is at l1_1. So to move p1 from l2_1 to l1_1, need to use a1 again.

16. Load p1 into a1 at l2_1.

17. Fly a1 to l1_1.

18. Unload p1.

19. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1.

20. Load p1 into t1.

21. Drive to l1_2.

22. Unload p1. (Now p1 is in l1_2, meeting the constraint)

Then, to get p1 to l2_5:

23. Load p1 into t1.

24. Drive to l1_1.

25. Load into a1.

26. Fly to l2_1.

27. Unload.

28. Load into t2.

29. Drive to l2_5.

30. Unload.

This is even longer.

Alternatively, after step 10 (p2 at goal), use a1 to transport p1:

11. Drive t2 to l2_3, load p1.

12. Drive to l2_1.

13. Unload.

14. Load into a1.

15. Fly to l1_1.

16. Unload.

17. Drive t1 to l1_1, load p1.

18. Drive to l1_2, unload. (p1 in l1_2, meeting constraint)

19. Then, transport back to l2_5 as before.

But this again adds steps.

It's clear that satisfying the constraint requires extra steps, and the optimal plan is likely to have around 20 steps. However, perhaps there's a way to interleave the steps to minimize the total number.

Let me try to construct the plan step by step, ensuring the constraint is met and the steps are minimized.

1. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (Wait, but t2 is initially at l2_4. So first need to drive to l2_3.)

Wait, initial positions:

- t1 is at l1_2 (c1)

- t2 is at l2_4 (c2)

- a1 at l1_1 (c1's airport)

- a2 at l2_1 (c2's airport)

Packages:

- p1 at l2_3 (c2)

- p2 at l1_1 (c1)

Goal: p1 at l2_5 (c2), p2 at l1_2 (c1)

Constraint: At some state, p2 in a2 and p1 in l1_2.

Let's try to merge the steps for p1 and p2.

Steps:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2 (move t2 to p1's location)

2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

3. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2 (move to airport)

4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

5. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (a2 is at l2_1)

6. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (now a2 is at l1_1 with p1)

7. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (p1 is at l1_1)

8. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 (move t1 to l1_1)

9. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

10. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1 (return to l1_2)

11. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 (now p1 is in l1_2, meeting part of the constraint)

Now, steps for p2:

12. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (a1 is at l1_1)

13. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (move to c2's airport)

14. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

15. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (a2 is at l1_1 now, so this can't be done. Wait, step 6 flew a2 to l1_1. So a2 is no longer at l2_1. So this step is invalid.

Ah, here's a problem. After step 6, a2 is at l1_1. So step 15 can't load p2 into a2 at l2_1 because a2 is not there.

So this approach is invalid. Need to adjust.

Alternative approach: Let's first handle p2's movement to a2.

Steps for p2:

1. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

2. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

3. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

4. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (now p2 is in a2, meeting part of the constraint)

Now, fly a2 to l1_1 to get p2 closer to its goal.

5. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (now a2 is at l1_1 with p2)

Steps for p1:

6. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2 (move to p1)

7. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

8. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2 (move to airport)

9. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

10. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (but a2 is at l1_1 now. So this is impossible. So need to fly a2 back to l2_1.

Wait, after step 5, a2 is at l1_1. So to load p1 into a2, a2 needs to be at l2_1. So:

5. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (carrying p2)

6. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (p2 is now in l1_1)

7. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1 (return to l2_1)

Now, continue steps for p1:

8. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

9. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (now a2 has p1)

10. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

11. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1

12. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

13. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1

14. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 (p1 in l1_2)

Now, during step 4, p2 is in a2 at l2_1. But p1 is not in l1_2 yet. After step 14, p1 is in l1_2, but p2 was unloaded into l1_1 in step 6. So the constraint isn't met.

Hmm. This is tricky.

Alternative plan:

1. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

2. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

3. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

4. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (now p2 in a2)

5. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (now a2 at l1_1 with p2)

6. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2

7. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

8. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

9. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

10. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (but a2 is at l1_1, can't load. So need to fly a2 back.

11. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1 (now a2 is back at l2_1 with p2)

12. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

13. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (now a2 has p1 and p2)

14. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

15. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (now p1 and p2 are in l1_1)

16. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1

17. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

18. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1

19. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (p2 at goal)

20. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (assuming t1 is back at l1_1)

But steps are getting too convoluted.

Perhaps the optimal plan is the initial one I thought of, which satisfies the constraint and then proceeds to the goal, even if it's lengthy.

Final plan:

```
```
1. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
2. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
3. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
4. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
5. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2
6. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
7. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
8. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
9. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
10. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
11. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
12. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
13. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
14. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
15. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
16. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
17. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
18. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
19. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
20. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
21. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
22. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
23. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
24. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
25. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
26. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
27. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
28. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
29. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
```
```

But this is 29 steps, which seems too long. However, the user requires an optimal plan. But perhaps there's a shorter way.

Wait, after step 15, p1 is in l1_2 and p2 is in a2 (since step 4 loaded p2 into a2, and step 10 flew a2 to l1_1, and step 15 unloads p1 but leaves p2 in a2. So between steps 10 and 16, a2 is at l1_1 with p2 inside. So after step 15, the state is:

- p1 in l1_2 (from step 15)

- p2 in a2 (from step 4, still in a2 because step 16 hasn't been done yet)

So the constraint is met after step 15. Then step 16 unloads p2 from a2 into l1_1. So steps 1-15 satisfy the constraint. Then steps 16-20 move p2 to its goal, and steps 21-29 move p1 to its goal.

But can we optimize steps 21-29? For example, after step 15, p1 is in l1_2. To get to l2_5:

- Load p1 into t1 (step 21).

- Drive to l1_1 (step 22).

- Load into a1 (step 23).

- Fly to l2_1 (step 24).

- Unload (step 25).

- Load into t2 (step 26).

- Drive to l2_5 (step 27).

- Unload (step 28).

That's 8 steps. So total steps: 20 (steps 1-20) for p2, and 8 steps for p1, totaling 28. Still long.

But perhaps there's a way to merge steps. For example, after step 15 (p1 in l1_2), we can:

16. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (now p2 in l1_1)

17. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1

18. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

19. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1

20. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (p2 at goal)

21. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2

22. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1

23. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

24. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

25. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

26. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

27. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

28. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2

29. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

This is 29 steps. But maybe steps can be optimized.

Wait, after step 20, p2 is at goal. Then steps 21-29 handle p1. But after step 15, p1 is in l1_2. The goal is to get p1 to l2_5. So why not use airplane a2 to transport p1 from l1_1 to l2_1 instead of a1? For example:

After step 15:

16. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

17. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1

18. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

19. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1

20. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

21. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2

22. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1

23. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

24. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

25. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1

26. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

27. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

28. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2

29. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

This saves a few steps (using a2 instead of a1). So total steps 29.

But it's still lengthy. However, given the problem constraints, this might be the optimal plan.

Final Answer:

The optimal plan that satisfies the constraint and goals involves moving both packages through airplanes and trucks, ensuring that at some point p2 is in a2 and p1 is in l1_2. Here's the step-by-step plan:

```
1. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
2. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
3. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
4. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
5. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2
6. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
7. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
8. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
9. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
10. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
11. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
12. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
13. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
14. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
15. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
16. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
17. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
18. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
19. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
20. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
21. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
22. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
23. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
24. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
25. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
26. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
27. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
28. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
29. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
30. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
```

But I notice some redundancy here. Let me check again.

Wait, step 23 is fly a2 from l1_1 to l2_1, but after step 10, a2 is at l1_1. Then step 25 loads p1 into a2 at l1_1. So steps 25-27:

25. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (since a2 is there after step 10)

26. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1

27. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

So steps 23-27 can be:

23. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

24. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1

25. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

Then steps 28-29:

26. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

27. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2

28. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

So this reduces steps. Let me reconstruct the plan properly:

Final optimized plan:

```
```
1. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
2. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
3. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
4. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
5. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2
6. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
7. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
8. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
9. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
10. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
11. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
12. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
13. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
14. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
15. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
16. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
17. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
18. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
19. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
20. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
21. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
22. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
23. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
24. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
25. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
26. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
27. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
28. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
29. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
```
```

But this is still 29 steps. However, the constraint is satisfied after step 15, where p1 is in l1_2 and p2 is in a2 (from step 4 to step 16). But step 16 unloads p2 from a2, so between steps 10 and 16, p2 is in a2 and p1 is in l1_2 after step 15. So the constraint is met in the state after step 15.

But maybe there's a shorter way. For example, after step 10, a2 is at l1_1 with both p1 and p2. Then unload p1 and p2 in l1_1. Then move them both via truck. But this doesn't satisfy the constraint unless p2 is in a2 and p1 is in l1_2 at the same time.

Alternatively, after step 10 (a2 at l1_1 with p1 and p2), unload p1 (step 11) but keep p2 in a2. Then drive t1 to l1_1, load p1, drive to l1_2, unload (steps 12-15). Then, p1 is in l1_2 and p2 is still in a2. So the constraint is met at this point. Then unload p2 from a2 (step 16) and move to l1_2.

So steps 1-15 meet the constraint. Then steps 16-20 for p2. Then steps 21-28 for p1.

This reduces the steps. Let's recount:

1. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

2. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

3. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

4. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

5. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2

6. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

7. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

8. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

9. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

10. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

11. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

12. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1

13. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

14. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1

15. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 (constraint met here)

16. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

17. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1

18. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

19. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1

20. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

21. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1

22. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

23. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

24. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

25. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

26. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

27. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2

28. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

Total steps: 28. This is better but still long.

I think the optimal plan must involve these steps, given the constraints. Therefore, the final answer is the sequence of actions as outlined.
