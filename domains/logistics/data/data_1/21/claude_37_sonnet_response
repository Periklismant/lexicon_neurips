Let's break down this problem.

We have 2 cities, c1 and c2, each with 5 locations. There are 2 trucks and 2 airplanes, and 2 packages p1 and p2. The first location in each city is an airport.

The initial state is:
- Locations l1_1, l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5 are in city c1.
- Locations l2_1, l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5 are in city c2.
- Package p1 is in location l2_3 (city c2).
- Package p2 is in location l1_1 (city c1).
- Truck t1 is in location l1_2 (city c1).
- Truck t2 is in location l2_4 (city c2).
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (airport in city c1).
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1 (airport in city c2).

The goal is:
- Package p1 is in location l2_5 (city c2).
- Package p2 is in location l1_2 (city c1).

There's also a constraint:
- At some point, package p2 must be in airplane a2 and package p1 must be in location l1_2 (city c1).

Let's think about the plan. The constraint tells us that package p1 must be moved from l2_3 to l1_2 at some point, and package p2 must be loaded onto a2. Then, we need to ensure p1 ends up in l2_5 and p2 ends up in l1_2.

Given the constraint, a reasonable approach would be:
1. Move truck t2 to l2_3 to pick up p1.
2. Drive t2 to l2_1 (the airport in city c2).
3. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1.
4. Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1.
5. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1 (the airport in city c1).
6. Move truck t1 to l1_1 to pick up p2.
7. Drive t1 to l1_2.
8. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_2.
9. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1.
10. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_1.
11. Drive t1 to l1_2.
12. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_2.
   - At this point, the constraint is satisfied: p2 is in l1_2 and p1 is in l1_2.
13. Load p1 onto a1 at l1_1.
14. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
15. Move truck t2 to l2_1 (if not already there).
16. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1.
17. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_1.
18. Drive t2 to l2_5.
19. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_5.

But wait, there are some inconsistencies in this plan. Let me re-think this, taking into account the specific locations and movements.

Corrected plan:
1. Move truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_3 to pick up p1.
2. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_3.
3. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1 (the airport in city c2).
4. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1.
5. Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1.
6. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1 (the airport in city c1).
7. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1.
8. Load p2 onto a2 at l1_1.
   - Note: p2 is initially at l1_1, so this can happen.
9. Move truck t1 from l1_2 to l1_1.
10. Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1.
    - This is to satisfy the constraint, but it contradicts step 8. Let me rethink.

Actually, the constraint is that at some point, "p2 is in a2" AND "p1 is in l1_2". It doesn't say they have to be there at the same time.

Let me re-plan:
1. Load p2 onto a2 at l1_1.
   - This requires a2 to fly from l2_1 to l1_1 first.
2. Unload p2 from a2.
3. [... other steps to move p1 to l1_2 ...]
   - This would fulfill the constraint.
4. [... remaining steps to achieve the goal ...]

Let's systematically identify what we need to do to achieve the goal while respecting the constraint.

Goal: p1 in l2_5, p2 in l1_2.
Constraint: At some point, p2 is in a2 AND p1 is in l1_2.

Initial state:
- p1 in l2_3
- p2 in l1_1
- t1 in l1_2
- t2 in l2_4
- a1 in l1_1
- a2 in l2_1

Step 1: Plan for Package p1
- We need to move p1 from l2_3 to l2_5.
- On the way, we need to ensure p1 passes through l1_2 (for the constraint).

Step 2: Plan for Package p2
- We need to move p2 from l1_1 to l1_2.
- On the way, we need to ensure p2 is in a2 at some point (for the constraint).

Let's detail the steps:

For Package p1:
1. Move t2 from l2_4 to l2_3.
2. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_3.
3. Drive t2 to the airport l2_1.
4. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1.
5. Load p1 onto an airplane (either a1 or a2) at l2_1.
6. Fly the airplane to l1_1.
7. Unload p1 from the airplane at l1_1.
8. Move a truck (t1) to l1_1.
9. Load p1 onto the truck at l1_1.
10. Drive the truck to l1_2.
11. Unload p1 at l1_2.
    - This satisfies part of the constraint.
12. Load p1 back onto the truck at l1_2.
13. Drive the truck back to l1_1.
14. Unload p1 from the truck at l1_1.
15. Load p1 onto an airplane at l1_1.
16. Fly the airplane to l2_1.
17. Unload p1 from the airplane at l2_1.
18. Move t2 to l2_1.
19. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_1.
20. Drive t2 to l2_5.
21. Unload p1 at l2_5.
    - This achieves the goal for p1.

For Package p2:
1. Load p2 onto a2 at l1_1.
    - But wait, a2 is in l2_1 initially, so we need to fly a2 to l1_1 first.
2. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
3. Load p2 onto a2 at l1_1.
    - This satisfies part of the constraint.
4. Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1.
5. Move t1 to l1_1.
6. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_1.
7. Drive t1 to l1_2.
8. Unload p2 at l1_2.
    - This achieves the goal for p2.

Let's ensure the timing is correct.
- For the constraint, we need p1 in l1_2 and p2 in a2 at the same time.
- Looking at the plans, p1 is in l1_2 at step 11 of its plan.
- p2 is in a2 at step 3 of its plan.

These steps can't happen simultaneously, so we need to replan.

Actually, I realize now that the constraint is NOT explicitly saying that the two conditions need to hold simultaneously. It's asking for a state where both are true. So we need to ensure that at some point in our plan, p2 is in a2 AND p1 is in l1_2. They need to be true in the same state.

Let's reformulate our plan:

1. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
2. Load p2 onto a2 at l1_1.
3. Move t2 from l2_4 to l2_3.
4. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_3.
5. Drive t2 to l2_1 (the airport in city c2).
6. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1.
7. Load p1 onto a1 at l2_1.
   - Note: a1 is initially at l1_1, so we need to fly a1 to l2_1 first.
8. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
9. Load p1 onto a1 at l2_1.
10. Fly a1 from l2_1 to l1_1.
11. Unload p1 from a1 at l1_1.
12. Move t1 from l1_2 to l1_1.
13. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_1.
14. Drive t1 to l1_2.
15. Unload p1 at l1_2.
    - Now p1 is in l1_2, but we also need p2 to be in a2 at the same time.
16. Load p1 back onto t1 at l1_2.
17. Drive t1 back to l1_1.
18. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1.
19. Load p1 onto a1 at l1_1.
20. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
21. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1.
22. Move t2 to l2_1.
23. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_1.
24. Drive t2 to l2_5.
25. Unload p1 at l2_5.
26. Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1.
27. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_1.
28. Drive t1 to l1_2.
29. Unload p2 at l1_2.

But this still doesn't ensure the constraint is satisfied at a single state. Let's reconsider.

I think the clearest approach would be to:
1. Move p2 from l1_1 to a2.
2. Move p1 from l2_3 to l1_2.
3. At this point, the constraint is satisfied.
4. Then, move p1 from l1_2 to l2_5 (goal).
5. Move p2 from a2 to l1_2 (goal).

Let's detail this approach:

1. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
2. Load p2 onto a2 at l1_1.
3. Move t2 from l2_4 to l2_3.
4. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_3.
5. Drive t2 to l2_1 (the airport in city c2).
6. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1.
7. Load p1 onto a1 at l2_1.
   - a1 is initially at l1_1, so we need to fly it to l2_1.
8. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
9. Load p1 onto a1 at l2_1.
10. Fly a1 from l2_1 to l1_1.
11. Unload p1 from a1 at l1_1.
12. Move t1 from l1_2 to l1_1.
13. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_1.
14. Drive t1 to l1_2.
15. Unload p1 at l1_2.
    - At this point, p1 is in l1_2 and p2 is in a2, satisfying the constraint.
16. Load p1 back onto t1 at l1_2.
17. Drive t1 back to l1_1.
18. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1.
19. Load p1 onto a1 at l1_1.
20. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
21. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1.
22. Move t2 to l2_1.
23. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_1.
24. Drive t2 to l2_5.
25. Unload p1 at l2_5.
    - Goal for p1 achieved.
26. Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1.
27. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_1.
28. Drive t1 to l1_2.
29. Unload p2 at l1_2.
    - Goal for p2 achieved.

Now let's check carefully and see if each step works:

Steps 1 and 2 are straightforward, moving p2 onto a2.

Step 3-6 move p1 from l2_3 to l2_1 using t2.

But wait, steps 7-9 are redundant. I say "load p1 onto a1 at l2_1," then fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1, and then load p1 onto a1 again. Let me fix this:

1. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
2. Load p2 onto a2 at l1_1.
3. Move t2 from l2_4 to l2_3.
4. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_3.
5. Drive t2 to l2_1 (the airport in city c2).
6. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1.
7. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
8. Load p1 onto a1 at l2_1.
9. Fly a1 from l2_1 to l1_1.
10. Unload p1 from a1 at l1_1.
11. Move t1 from l1_2 to l1_1.
12. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_1.
13. Drive t1 to l1_2.
14. Unload p1 at l1_2.
    - At this point, p1 is in l1_2 and p2 is in a2, satisfying the constraint.
15. Load p1 back onto t1 at l1_2.
16. Drive t1 back to l1_1.
17. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1.
18. Load p1 onto a1 at l1_1.
19. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
20. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1.
21. Move t2 from l2_3 to l2_1 (but t2 is already at l2_1 from step 5).
22. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_1.
23. Drive t2 to l2_5.
24. Unload p1 at l2_5.
    - Goal for p1 achieved.
25. Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1.
26. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_1.
27. Drive t1 to l1_2.
28. Unload p2 at l1_2.
    - Goal for p2 achieved.

Now, I want to double-check the constraint state. At step 14, I'm saying that "p1 is in l1_2 and p2 is in a2." But I haven't verified that p2 is still in a2 at this point. Let's check:

- p2 is loaded onto a2 at step 2, and it's unloaded at step 25.
- So, at step 14, p2 is indeed still in a2.
- And at step 14, p1 is in l1_2.

So, the constraint is indeed satisfied at step 14.

But step 21 seems redundant. It instructs to move t2 from l2_3 to l2_1, but t2 is already at l2_1 from step 5. Let's clean up:

1. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
2. Load p2 onto a2 at l1_1.
3. Move t2 from l2_4 to l2_3.
4. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_3.
5. Drive t2 to l2_1 (the airport in city c2).
6. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1.
7. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
8. Load p1 onto a1 at l2_1.
9. Fly a1 from l2_1 to l1_1.
10. Unload p1 from a1 at l1_1.
11. Move t1 from l1_2 to l1_1.
12. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_1.
13. Drive t1 to l1_2.
14. Unload p1 at l1_2.
    - Constraint satisfied: p1 is in l1_2 and p2 is in a2.
15. Load p1 back onto t1 at l1_2.
16. Drive t1 back to l1_1.
17. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1.
18. Load p1 onto a1 at l1_1.
19. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
20. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1.
21. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_1.
22. Drive t2 to l2_5.
23. Unload p1 at l2_5.
    - Goal for p1 achieved.
24. Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1.
25. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_1.
26. Drive t1 to l1_2.
27. Unload p2 at l1_2.
    - Goal for p2 achieved.

This looks cleaner. Let's recheck the plan to ensure all the steps are correct:

1. a2 flies from l2_1 to l1_1.
2. p2 is loaded onto a2 at l1_1.
3. t2 drives from l2_4 to l2_3.
4. p1 is loaded onto t2 at l2_3.
5. t2 drives to l2_1.
6. p1 is unloaded from t2 at l2_1.
7. a1 flies from l1_1 to l2_1.
8. p1 is loaded onto a1 at l2_1.
9. a1 flies from l2_1 to l1_1.
10. p1 is unloaded from a1 at l1_1.
11. t1 drives from l1_2 to l1_1.
12. p1 is loaded onto t1 at l1_1.
13. t1 drives to l1_2.
14. p1 is unloaded at l1_2.
    - Constraint: p1 is in l1_2 and p2 is in a2.
15. p1 is loaded back onto t1 at l1_2.
16. t1 drives back to l1_1.
17. p1 is unloaded from t1 at l1_1.
18. p1 is loaded onto a1 at l1_1.
19. a1 flies from l1_1 to l2_1.
20. p1 is unloaded from a1 at l2_1.
21. p1 is loaded onto t2 at l2_1.
22. t2 drives to l2_5.
23. p1 is unloaded at l2_5.
    - Goal for p1 achieved.
24. p2 is unloaded from a2 at l1_1.
25. p2 is loaded onto t1 at l1_1.
26. t1 drives to l1_2.
27. p2 is unloaded at l1_2.
    - Goal for p2 achieved.

This looks correct, but I'm concerned about potential inefficiencies in the plan. Let's review and see if we can simplify:

- p1 travels from l2_3 to l2_1 to l1_1 to l1_2 to l1_1 to l2_1 to l2_5.
- p2 travels from l1_1 to a2 to l1_1 to l1_2.

There's a step where we move p1 to l1_2 solely to satisfy the constraint, and then immediately move it back. Maybe there's a more efficient route, where the constraint is satisfied as part of the optimal path to the goals.

I think the plan is correct, but based on the constraint and the goals, there are several valid plans of equivalent length. Let's see if we can find another valid plan to ensure we're not missing anything:

Goal: p1 in l2_5, p2 in l1_2.
Constraint: At some point, p2 is in a2 AND p1 is in l1_2.

Initial state:
- p1 in l2_3
- p2 in l1_1
- t1 in l1_2
- t2 in l2_4
- a1 in l1_1
- a2 in l2_1

The shortest path for p1 would be from l2_3 to l2_5 directly, but the constraint necessitates p1 going through l1_2. Given this, we want to find the most efficient path for p1 from l2_3 to l2_5 that includes l1_2.

If we're optimizing for plan length, I'm not sure if there's a shorter plan. Let's stick with our plan:

Actually, rather than second-guessing, let's enumerate the plan steps with the correct action formats:

1. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (a2 flies from airport in city c2 to airport in city c1)
2. loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (p2 is loaded onto a2 at airport in city c1)
3. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2 (t2 drives from l2_4 to l2_3 in city c2)
4. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (p1 is loaded onto t2 at l2_3)
5. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2 (t2 drives to airport in city c2)
6. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (p1 is unloaded from t2 at airport in city c2)
7. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (a1 flies from airport in city c1 to airport in city c2)
8. loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 (p1 is loaded onto a1 at airport in city c2)
9. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1 (a1 flies from airport in city c2 to airport in city c1)
10. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (p1 is unloaded from a1 at airport in city c1)
11. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 (t1 drives from l1_2 to airport in city c1)
12. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (p1 is loaded onto t1 at airport in city c1)
13. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1 (t1 drives to l1_2 in city c1)
14. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 (p1 is unloaded at l1_2)
    - Constraint satisfied: p1 is in l1_2 and p2 is in a2.
15. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 (p1 is loaded back onto t1 at l1_2)
16. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 (t1 drives back to airport in city c1)
17. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (p1 is unloaded from t1 at airport in city c1)
18. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (p1 is loaded onto a1 at airport in city c1)
19. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (a1 flies from airport in city c1 to airport in city c2)
20. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 (p1 is unloaded from a1 at airport in city c2)
21. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (p1 is loaded onto t2 at airport in city c2)
22. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2 (t2 drives to l2_5 in city c2)
23. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (p1 is unloaded at l2_5)
    - Goal for p1 achieved.
24. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (p2 is unloaded from a2 at airport in city c1)
25. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (p2 is loaded onto t1 at airport in city c1)
26. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1 (t1 drives to l1_2 in city c1)
27. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (p2 is unloaded at l1_2)
    - Goal for p2 achieved.

Hmm, I realize I've been using incorrect action names for "loadairplane" and "unloadairplane". The correct ones should be "loadairplane" and "unloadairplane".

Let's double-check:
- To load a package onto an airplane: "loadairplane"
- To unload a package from an airplane: "unloadairplane"

Hmm, I was making a typo. The loading/unloading actions are "loadairplane" and "unloadairplane", so I was correct. Let me remove those comments:

1. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
2. loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
3. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2
4. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
5. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
6. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
7. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
8. loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
9. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
10. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
11. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
12. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
13. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
14. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
    - Constraint satisfied: p1 is in l1_2 and p2 is in a2.
15. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
16. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
17. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
18. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
19. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
20. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
21. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
22. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
23. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
    - Goal for p1 achieved.
24. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
25. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
26. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
27. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
    - Goal for p2 achieved.

Let's sanity-check our plan one last time. I think the plan looks good, but I'm concerned that we're being asked for an optimal plan. The plan I created may not be the shortest.

Let's think about two alternatives:
1. Move p2 to l1_2 directly without boarding a2.
2. Move p1 from l2_3 to l2_5 directly without going through l1_2.

But the constraint is that at some point, p2 must be in a2 AND p1 must be in l1_2. So, we can't use alternatives 1 or 2 directly.

I think our plan is near-optimal given the constraint. The only potential improvement might be in the logistics of airplane and truck movements, but I don't immediately see a way to shorten the plan while still satisfying the constraint.

This is our plan:

1. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
2. loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
3. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2
4. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
5. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
6. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
7. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
8. loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
9. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
10. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
11. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
12. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
13. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
14. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
    - Constraint satisfied: p1 is in l1_2 and p2 is in a2.
15. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
16. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
17. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
18. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
19. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
20. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
21. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
22. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2

    - Goal for p1 achieved.

27. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
    - Goal for p2 achieved.

Actually, I forgot to revisit the problem statement to see if anything is unclear:

"
The original state of the world is the following:
	"Location l1_1 is in city c1"
	"Location l1_2 is in city c1"
	"Location l1_3 is in city c1"
	"Location l1_4 is in city c1"
	"Location l1_5 is in city c1"
	"Location l2_1 is in city c2"
	"Location l2_2 is in city c2"
	"Location l2_3 is in city c2"
	"Location l2_4 is in city c2"
	"Location l2_5 is in city c2"
	"Package t1 is in location l1_2"
	"Package t2 is in location l2_4"
	"Package p1 is in location l2_3"
	"Package p2 is in location l1_1"
	"Package a1 is in location l1_1"
	"Package a2 is in location l2_1"
"

This is a bit confusing: "Package t1 is in location l1_2", "Package t2 is in location l2_4", "Package a1 is in location l1_1", and "Package a2 is in location l2_1." It seems like t1, t2, a1, and a2 are being referred to as packages. But from the context and the actions, t1 and t2 are trucks, and a1 and a2 are airplanes.

I'm going to assume that the correct interpretations are:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_2.
- Truck t2 is in location l2_4.
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1.
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1.

Let's apply these corrections to our initial state.

Let's be extremely precise about the domain and the problem:

We have 2 cities, c1 and c2, each with 5 locations. The first location in each city (l1_1 in c1 and l2_1 in c2) is an airport. There are 2 trucks (t1 and t2), 2 airplanes (a1 and a2), and 2 packages (p1 and p2).

Initial state:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_2 (city c1).
- Truck t2 is in location l2_4 (city c2).
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (airport in city c1).
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1 (airport in city c2).
- Package p1 is in location l2_3 (city c2).
- Package p2 is in location l1_1 (airport in city c1).

Destination:
- Package p1 needs to be in location l2_5 (city c2).
- Package p2 needs to be in location l1_2 (city c1).

Constraint:
- At some point, package p2 must be in airplane a2 AND package p1 must be in location l1_2.

Yep, our plan still makes sense.

But now I'm looking at step 11, where t1 drives from l1_2 to l1_1. However, t1 is initially in l1_2, and we haven't moved it before this step. So, this step should be valid without requiring t1 to have moved earlier. Let me recheck the plan:

1. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
2. loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
3. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2
4. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
5. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
6. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
7. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
8. loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
9. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
10. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
11. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
12. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
13. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
14. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
    - Constraint satisfied: p1 is in l1_2 and p2 is in a2.
15. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
16. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
17. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
18. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
19. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
20. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
21. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
22. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
23. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
    - Goal for p1 achieved.
24. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
25. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
26. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
27. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
    - Goal for p2 achieved.

This plan looks good! I think we've accounted for all the initial conditions, and the sequence of actions should logically lead to achieving both the goals and satisfying the constraint.

Let me check once more to ensure I haven't missed anything in the problem statement:

- We're moving 2 packages, p1 and p2, to their respective destinations.
- We have the constraint that, at some point, p2 should be in a2 AND p1 should be in l1_2.
- We use 2 trucks (t1 and t2) and 2 airplanes (a1 and a2) to achieve this.

This seems right.

So, the final optimal plan is:

1. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
2. loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
3. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2
4. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
5. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
6. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
7. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
8. loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
9. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
10. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
11. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
12. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
13. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
14. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
    - Constraint satisfied: p1 is in l1_2 and p2 is in a2.
15. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
16. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
17. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
18. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
19. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
20. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
21. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
22. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
23. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
    - Goal for p1 achieved.
24. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
25. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
26. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
27. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
    - Goal for p2 achieved.

Just to double-check:
- a2 flies from l2_1 to l1_1 and picks up p2.
- t2 picks up p1 from l2_3 and drops it off at l2_1.
- a1 picks up p1 at l2_1 and flies to l1_1.
- t1 picks up p1 at l1_1 and drives to l1_2.
- This satisfies the constraint.
- Then we move p1 back to l1_1, onto a1, back to l2_1, onto t2, and to l2_5.
- We also unload p2 from a2 at l1_1, onto t1, and drive to l1_2.

Everything looks good. This is the optimal plan!

I just realized that I'm saying "Airport l1_1 is in city c1", "Airport l2_1 is in city c2", but based on the problem statement, the locations are denoted as "Location l1_1 is in city c1". l1_1 and l2_1 are "airport" objects, not "location" objects. I'm not sure if this affects the action names. Let me double-check.

Upon re-reading the problem description, it states: "One location of each city is an airport." So, l1_1 and l2_1 are locations that are also designated as airports. I think my action names are correct.

And checking the initial state again:
- "Location l1_1 is in city c1"
- "Location l2_1 is in city c2"
- "Airport l1_1"
- "Airport l2_1"

So l1_1 and l2_1 are both locations and airports. My plan's action names are correct.

A final check: My approach might not be optimal. Let's try a different approach:

1. Move p2 from l1_1 to a2 (to satisfy part of the constraint).
2. Move p1 from l2_3 to l1_2 (to satisfy the other part of the constraint).
3. Move p1 from l1_2 to l2_5 (to satisfy one goal).
4. Move p2 from a2 to l1_2 (to satisfy the other goal).

Steps for this approach:
1. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
2. loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
3. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2
4. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
5. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
6. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
7. loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 -- But wait, a1 is currently at l1_1, not l2_1!

So, we need to fly a1 to l2_1 first. Let's revise:

1. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
2. loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
3. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2
4. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
5. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
6. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
7. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
8. loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
9. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
10. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
11. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
12. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
13. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
14. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
    - Constraint satisfied: p1 is in l1_2 and p2 is in a2.

Now, here's where I might be able to make a slight optimization. If we're thinking about optimal plans, we would want to take the shortest path from this point to achieve both goals.

For p1, the goal is to move it from l1_2 to l2_5. The shortest path is through l1_1 and l2_1, which requires using both a truck and an airplane, as we've been planning.

For p2, the goal is to move it from a2 to l1_2. Since a2 is in l1_1 at this point, we'd need to unload p2 from a2, load it onto t1, and drive to l1_2, which is exactly as we've been planning.

So, our plan should be optimal in terms of the number of steps.
