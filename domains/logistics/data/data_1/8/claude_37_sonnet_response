Alright, let's break down the problem:

1. I need to get p1 to l2_6 and p2 to l1_2.
2. At some point, p2 must be in l2_1.
3. If p2 is in l2_1, then at some point after or at the same time, p2 must be in a1 or t2.

Let's check the initial state and plan from there.

Initial state:
- Package p1 is in location l2_8 (city c2)
- Package p2 is in location l2_2 (city c2)
- Truck t1 is in location l1_7 (city c1)
- Truck t2 is in location l2_4 (city c2)
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (city c1)
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1 (city c2)

Goal:
- p1 should be in l2_6
- p2 should be in l1_2

Constraint 1: p2 must be in l2_1 at some point.
Constraint 2: If p2 is in l2_1, it must be loaded onto a1 or t2 at or after it's in l2_1.

For p1:
1. We need to get it from l2_8 to l2_6.
2. We can use truck t2 to transport it, since they are both in city c2.

For p2:
1. We need to get it from l2_2 to l1_2.
2. Given the constraint, it must pass through l2_1, and when it's in l2_1, it must be loaded onto a1 or t2.
3. Since l2_1 and l1_2 are in different cities, we'll likely use an airplane to transport it between cities.

Let's plan for p1 first:

1. Drive truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_8
2. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_8
3. Drive t2 from l2_8 to l2_6
4. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_6

Now, for p2:

1. Drive truck t2 from l2_6 (after dropping p1) to l2_2
2. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_2
3. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1
4. Unload p2 at l2_1 to satisfy constraint 1
5. Load p2 onto a2 (since it's at l2_1)
6. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1
7. Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1
8. Drive truck t1 from l1_7 to l1_1
9. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_1
10. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_2
11. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_2

However, there's a problem with this plan. According to the constraint, after p2 is in l2_1, it must be loaded onto a1 or t2. In my plan, I loaded it onto a2. Let's adjust the plan:

For p2:
1. Drive truck t2 from l2_6 (after dropping p1) to l2_2
2. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_2
3. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1
4. Unload p2 at l2_1 to satisfy constraint 1
5. Load p2 onto t2 (satisfying constraint 2)
6. Load p2 onto a2 (since it's at l2_1)
7. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1
8. Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1
9. Drive truck t1 from l1_7 to l1_1
10. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_1
11. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_2
12. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_2

Wait, there's a contradiction in my plan for p2. If p2 is already on t2, I can't load it onto a2. Let me rethink this.

For p2:

1. Drive truck t2 from l2_6 (after dropping p1) to l2_2
2. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_2
3. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1
4. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1 to satisfy constraint 1
5. Load p2 onto t2 again (satisfying constraint 2)
6. We need to get p2 to city c1. We can either:
   a. Load p2 onto a2 or a1 (if a1 flies to l2_1)
   b. Drive t2 to all locations in city c2, then unload p2 somewhere.

Actually, there's another issue I need to consider. The constraint says that if p2 is in l2_1, then it must be in a1 or t2 "at s or at some state after s." This means right after p2 is in l2_1, it must be loaded onto a1 or t2. Let me adjust the plan again.

For p2:

1. Drive truck t2 from l2_6 (after dropping p1) to l2_2
2. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_2
3. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1
4. p2 is now in l2_1 (via t2), satisfying both constraints. Constraint 1 is satisfied because p2 is in l2_1. Constraint 2 is satisfied because p2 is in t2 at the same time.
5. We need to get p2 to city c1. We can:
   a. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1.
   b. Load p2 onto a2 (since a2 is at l2_1).
   c. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
   d. Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1.
   e. Drive truck t1 from l1_7 to l1_1.
   f. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_1.
   g. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_2.
   h. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_2.

Wait, there's another issue. The initial state says that a1 and a2 are packages. That doesn't sound right. Checking the problem statement again, I see that they are defined as airplanes. I think there's an issue with the initial state. Let me adjust my understanding and plan again.

I'm going to restate what I believe the initial state is, based on the context of the problem:

Initial state:
- Package p1 is in location l2_8 (city c2)
- Package p2 is in location l2_2 (city c2)
- Truck t1 is in location l1_7 (city c1)
- Truck t2 is in location l2_4 (city c2)
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (airport of city c1)
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1 (airport of city c2)

Now, let's replan:

For p1:
1. Drive truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_8
2. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_8
3. Drive t2 from l2_8 to l2_6
4. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_6

For p2:
1. Drive truck t2 from l2_6 (after dropping p1) to l2_2
2. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_2
3. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1
4. p2 is now in l2_1 (via t2), satisfying constraint 1. Additionally, since p2 is in t2 at the same time, constraint 2 is also satisfied.
5. Now, to get p2 to city c1, we can:
   a. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1.
   b. Load p2 onto a2 (since a2 is at l2_1).
   c. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
   d. Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1.
   e. Drive truck t1 from l1_7 to l1_1.
   f. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_1.
   g. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_2.
   h. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_2.

Actually, there's an alternative way to satisfy constraint 2. We could have p2 in a1 after it's in l2_1. Let me think about this again.

From the initial state, a1 is in l1_1. To get a1 to l2_1, we would:
1. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.

But this would be an extra step compared to using a2, which is already at l2_1.

However, there's another possibility. If we're considering optimality:

For p2:
1. Drive truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_2
2. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_2
3. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1
4. p2 is now in l2_1 (via t2), satisfying constraint 1. Additionally, since p2 is in t2 at the same time, constraint 2 is also satisfied.
5. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1.
6. (Getting a1 to l2_1):
   a. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
7. Load p2 onto a1 at l2_1. (This also satisfies constraint 2 if we considered unloading p2 from t2 first.)
8. Fly a1 from l2_1 to l1_1.
9. Unload p2 from a1 at l1_1.
10. Drive truck t1 from l1_7 to l1_1.
11. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_1.
12. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_2.
13. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_2.

This is a longer plan than the one using a2. So, it's better to stick with the previous plan using a2.

But wait, I've been making a crucial mistake. The constraint doesn't require that p2 is loaded onto a1 or t2 immediately after (or at the same time) it's in l2_1. It just says "at s or at some state after s." This means p2
 can be in a1 or t2 any time after it's in l2_1, not necessarily immediately after.

But then, reading the constraint again, I think I misunderstood. It says "if p2 is in l2_1, then at some state at or after that, p2 must be in a1 or t2." This means that after p2 is in l2_1, it must be loaded onto a1 or t2 at some point.

Whew. Ok, so (i) we need a state where p2 is in l2_1. and (ii) at or after this state, we need a state where p2 is in a1 or t2. At no point does it need to be at the same time.

So the constraint would be satisfied if:
1. p2 is in l2_1
2. Later, p2 is loaded onto either a1 or t2

Ok, let me redo the plan for optimal length:

For p1:
1. Drive truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_8
2. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_8
3. Drive t2 from l2_8 to l2_6
4. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_6

For p2:
1. Drive truck t2 from l2_6 (after dropping p1) to l2_2
2. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_2
3. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1 (this satisfies constraint 1, because p2 is in l2_1 via t2)
4. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1
5. Load p2 onto a2 (since a2 is at l2_1)
6. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1
7. Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1
8. Drive truck t1 from l1_7 to l1_1
9. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_1
10. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_2
11. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_2

Actually, there's a flaw in this plan. Step 3 doesn't satisfy constraint 1. Constraint 1 requires that p2 is *in* location l2_1, not just that the truck containing p2 is in l2_1. I think the constraint requires p2 to be directly in location l2_1, not inside a truck or airplane. Let me try again.

Let's satisfy constraint 1 by making sure p2 is directly in location l2_1 at some point.

For p1:
1. Drive truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_8
2. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_8
3. Drive t2 from l2_8 to l2_6
4. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_6

For p2:
1. Drive truck t2 from l2_6 (after dropping p1) to l2_2
2. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_2
3. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1
4. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1 (this satisfies constraint 1)
5. Load p2 onto t2 (this satisfies constraint 2, because after p2 is in l2_1, it's now in t2)
6. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_6 (or anywhere in city c2, it doesn't matter as long as it's a location in city c2)
7. Unload p2 from t2 at the chosen location
8. Drive t2 back to l2_1
9. Load p2 onto a2 (since a2 is at l2_1)
10. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1
11. Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1
12. Drive truck t1 from l1_7 to l1_1
13. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_1
14. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_2
15. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_2

Actually, this plan is unnecessarily convoluted, with steps 6-8. Let me simplify.

For p2:
1. Drive truck t2 from l2_6 (after dropping p1) to l2_2
2. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_2
3. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1
4. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1 (this satisfies constraint 1)
5. Load p2 onto a2 (this satisfies constraint 2, because after p2 is in l2_1, it's now in a2)
6. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1
7. Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1
8. Drive truck t1 from l1_7 to l1_1
9. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_1
10. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_2
11. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_2

Hmm, wait a sec. I need to check the wording again. 

The constraint says "Then expression ... must hold at s or at some state after s."

So for constraint 2 to be satisfied, after p2 is in l2_1, it must be in a1 or t2. But a2 is not mentioned, so putting p2 on a2 doesn't satisfy constraint 2.

Alright so the options are:

1. Fly a1 to l2_1, then load p2 onto a1 (this satisfies constraint 2).
2. Load p2 back onto t2 (this also satisfies constraint 2).

Let's see.

Using a1:
1. Drive truck t2 from l2_6 (after dropping p1) to l2_2
2. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_2
3. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1
4. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1 (this satisfies constraint 1)
5. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1
6. Load p2 onto a1 (this satisfies constraint 2)
7. Fly a1 from l2_1 to l1_1
8. Unload p2 from a1 at l1_1
9. Drive truck t1 from l1_7 to l1_1
10. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_1
11. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_2
12. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_2

Using t2:
1. Drive truck t2 from l2_6 (after dropping p1) to l2_2
2. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_2
3. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1
4. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1 (this satisfies constraint 1)
5. Load p2 onto t2 again (this satisfies constraint 2)
6. Now, we need to get p2 to l1_2, which is in city c1. Since t2 is in city c2, we need to transfer p2 to a1 or a2.
   a. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_1 (it's already there, so this step is redundant)
   b. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1
   c. Load p2 onto a2 (since a2 is at l2_1)
   d. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1
   e. Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1
   f. Drive truck t1 from l1_7 to l1_1
   g. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_1
   h. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_2
   i. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_2

The plan using a1 has 12 steps, while the plan using t2 has 13 steps. So, for optimal length, it's better to use a1.

Actually, I made an error. The step "Load p2 onto t2 again (this satisfies constraint 2)" is followed immediately by "Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1". This makes the loading and unloading redundant. Let's revise the t2 plan.

Using t2:
1. Drive truck t2 from l2_6 (after dropping p1) to l2_2
2. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_2
3. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1
4. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1 (this satisfies constraint 1)
5. Load p2 onto t2 again (this satisfies constraint 2)
6. Now, we need to get p2 to l1_2, which is in city c1. Since t2 is in city c2, we need to transfer p2 to a1 or a2.
   a. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1
   b. Load p2 onto a2 (since a2 is at l2_1)
   c. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1
   d. Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1
   e. Drive truck t1 from l1_7 to l1_1
   f. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_1
   g. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_2
   h. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_2

This plan now has 12 steps, the same as the a1 plan. Let's note that we load p2 onto t2 and then immediately unload it. This seems wasteful.

Directly loading p2 onto a2 after unloading it from t2 doesn't satisfy constraint 2, because the constraint explicitly requires p2 to be in a1 or t2 after it's in l2_1. So we have to either load it onto t2 again immediately and then unloaded it immediately, or fly a1 to l2_1 and load p2 onto a1. It seems that the a1 approach is more straightforward for this constraint,since we can avoid the load, unload cycle.

Ok, I think I'm satisfied with our approach using a1.

Combining the plans for p1 and p2:

1. Drive truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_8
2. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_8
3. Drive t2 from l2_8 to l2_6
4. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_6
5. Drive truck t2 from l2_6 to l2_2
6. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_2
7. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1
8. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1 (this satisfies constraint 1)
9. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1
10. Load p2 onto a1 (this satisfies constraint 2)
11. Fly a1 from l2_1 to l1_1
12. Unload p2 from a1 at l1_1
13. Drive truck t1 from l1_7 to l1_1
14. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_1
15. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_2
16. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_2

Alternatively, I wonder if we can satisfy the constraints in a less convoluted way. The key is that:

1. At some point, p2 must be in l2_1. 
2. After p2 is in l2_1, at some point p2 must be in a1 or t2.

So let's see if there's a simple path for p2 to satisfy these constraints where they are steps getting us to the goal (having p2 in l1_2):

1. Drive truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_2
2. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_2
3. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1
4. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1 (this satisfies constraint 1)
5. Load p2 onto a2 (a2 is already at l2_1)
6. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1
7. Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1
8. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1 (now a1 is at l2_1)
9. Drive truck t1 from l1_7 to l1_1
10. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_1
11. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_2
12. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_2

But this doesn't satisfy constraint 2, since p2 has already gone to city c1 before step 8.

Hmm, let me be more methodical.

Let me explicitly check constraint satisfaction to make sure my prior plan is ok.

The initial state says p2 is in l2_2.

To get p2 to l1_2, these are the steps it must go through:
1. l2_2 (initially)
2. t2 (after we load it onto t2)
3. l2_1 (after t2 drives to l2_1 and we unload p2)
4. a1 (after a1 flies to l2_1 and we load p2)
5. l1_1 (after a1 flies to l1_1 and we unload p2)
6. t1 (after t1 drives to l1_1 and we load p2)
7. l1_2 (after t1 drives to l1_2 and we unload p2) - final goal state

So at step 3, p2 is in l2_1, which satisfies constraint 1.
At step 4, after p2 is in l2_1, it's in a1, which satisfies constraint 2.

Yep, this works!

Let's now combine the plans for p1 and p2, and determine the most optimal way to do it.

For p1:
1. Drive truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_8
2. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_8
3. Drive t2 from l2_8 to l2_6
4. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_6

For p2:
5. Drive truck t2 from l2_6 to l2_2
6. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_2
7. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1
8. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1 (this satisfies constraint 1)
9. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1
10. Load p2 onto a1 (this satisfies constraint 2)
11. Fly a1 from l2_1 to l1_1
12. Unload p2 from a1 at l1_1
13. Drive truck t1 from l1_7 to l1_1
14. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_1
15. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_2
16. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_2

These steps, in this order, should optimally satisfy all the constraints and goals.

Alright, I'll translate this into the required format (with action names in the required format:

```
drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_8 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_8
drivetruck t2 l2_8 l2_6 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_6
drivetruck t2 l2_6 l2_2 c2
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_1 c1
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
```

Actually, let me double check my format for the actions. The problem statement describes the actions as:

- "loadtruck p t l": Load package p in truck t. Both p and t are in location l.
- "loadairplane p ap l": Load package p in airplane ap. Both p and ap are in location l.
- "unloadtruck p t l": Unload package p from truck t in location l.
- "unloadairplane p ap l": Unload package p from airplane ap in location l.
- "drivetruck t l_from l_to c": Drive truck t from location l_from to location l_to in city c.
- "flyairplane ap l_from l_to": Fly airplane ap from location l_from to location l_to.

For loadairplane and  unloadairplane my order of arguments is off. Let me correct the action names:

```
drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_8 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_8
drivetruck t2 l2_8 l2_6 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_6
drivetruck t2 l2_6 l2_2 c2
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_1 c1
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
```

Oops, I missed another issue with an action name. loadairplane is given twice in the problem statement (once for loading, once for unloading). Clearly one of them should be "unloadairplane". Based on the preconditions, I believe the second one is intended to be "unloadairplane". My plan already uses "unloadairplane" in the correct way, so I think my action names are correct.

Let me double check that all the preconditions are satisfied for each action in sequence:

1. `drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_8 c2`: t2 is in l2_4, and l2_4 and l2_8 are both in c2. Preconditions satisfied.
2. `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_8`: p1 is in l2_8, and t2 is in l2_8 after step 1. Preconditions satisfied.
3. `drivetruck t2 l2_8 l2_6 c2`: t2 is in l2_8 after step 1, and l2_8 and l2_6 are both in c2. Preconditions satisfied.
4. `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_6`: t2 is in l2_6 after step 3, and p1 is in t2 after step 2. Preconditions satisfied.
5. `drivetruck t2 l2_6 l2_2 c2`: t2 is in l2_6 after step 3, and l2_6 and l2_2 are both in c2. Preconditions satisfied.
6. `loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2`: p2 is initially in l2_2, and t2 is in l2_2 after step 5. Preconditions satisfied.
7. `drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2`: t2 is in l2_2 after step 5, and l2_2 and l2_1 are both in c2. Preconditions satisfied.
8. `unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1`: t2 is in l2_1 after step 7, and p2 is in t2 after step 6. Preconditions satisfied.
9. `flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1`: a1 is initially in l1_1. Preconditions satisfied.
10. `loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1`: p2 is in l2_1 after step 8, and a1 is in l2_1 after step 9. Preconditions satisfied.
11. `flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1`: a1 is in l2_1 after step 9. Preconditions satisfied.
12. `unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1`: a1 is in l1_1 after step 11, and p2 is in a1 after step 10. Preconditions satisfied.
13. `drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_1 c1`: t1 is initially in l1_7, and l1_7 and l1_1 are both in c1. Preconditions satisfied.
14. `loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1`: p2 is in l1_1 after step 12, and t1 is in l1_1 after step 13. Preconditions satisfied.
15. `drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1`: t1 is in l1_1 after step 13, and l1_1 and l1_2 are both in c1. Preconditions satisfied.
16. `unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2`: t1 is in l1_2 after step 15, and p2 is in t1 after step 14. Preconditions satisfied.

Alright, the plan is valid. Let's also check that the constraints are satisfied:

Constraint 1: p2 must be in l2_1 at some point. This is satisfied after step 8, where we unload p2 from t2 at l2_1.

Constraint 2: If p2 is in l2_1, then at some state at or after that, p2 must be in a1 or t2. This is satisfied at step 10, where we load p2 onto a1. (And, importantly, this is after p2 is in l2_1.)

Additionally, the goal is satisfied after step 16, with p1 in l2_6 and p2 in l1_2.

So the finalized plan is:

```
drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_8 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_8
drivetruck t2 l2_8 l2_6 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_6
drivetruck t2 l2_6 l2_2 c2
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_1 c1
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
