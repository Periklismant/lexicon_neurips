Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. So, the goal is to get p1 to l2_6 and p2 to l1_2, right? And there are some constraints we need to satisfy. Let me start by understanding the initial state and the constraints.

First, the initial locations:

- p1 is in l2_8 (city c2)
- p2 is in l2_2 (city c2)
- t1 is in l1_7 (city c1)
- t2 is in l2_4 (city c2)
- a1 is in l1_1 (airport in c1)
- a2 is in l2_1 (airport in c2)

The goal is p1 at l2_6 (c2) and p2 at l1_2 (c1). So p1 needs to move within c2, while p2 needs to go from c2 to c1.

Constraints:

1. At some state, p2 must be in l2_1. So, p2 has to be at the airport of c2 at some point.
2. If p2 is in l2_1 in a state, then either p2 is in a1 or t2 in that state or a subsequent one. But wait, a1 is in c1's airport. If p2 is in l2_1 (c2's airport), how can it be in a1 which is in c1? Unless we fly a1 to l2_1, load p2, then fly back. Alternatively, use t2 to carry p2. Let me think.

Wait, the constraint says that whenever p2 is in l2_1 at any state s, then in s or a later state, p2 must be in a1 or t2. So if p2 is unloaded in l2_1 (the airport), we need to ensure that either it's immediately loaded into a1 or t2. But t2 is a truck in c2. So if p2 is in l2_1, and we load it into t2, that's possible. But t2 is in city c2, so l2_1 is in c2. So maybe drive t2 to l2_1, load p2 into t2 there, then drive to another location?

Wait, but initially, t2 is in l2_4. So to get p2 to l2_1, maybe we need to move t2 to l2_2 (where p2 is), load p2 into t2, then drive to l2_1. But then, when p2 is in l2_1 (if we unload it there), we have to make sure that it's then loaded into either a1 or t2. But why would we unload it there? Maybe to transfer to an airplane. Let's see.

So for p2 to get to c1, it has to be transported via airplane. Because trucks can't go between cities. So the plan for p2 would be: move it from l2_2 to the airport l2_1 (using truck t2), load it onto an airplane (maybe a2, which is already at l2_1), fly a2 to l1_1 (c1's airport), then unload p2 and use truck t1 (which is in c1) to take it to l1_2.

But wait, the initial location of a2 is l2_1. So we can load p2 onto a2 at l2_1, fly a2 to l1_1, unload p2 there. Then use t1 (which is in l1_7) to drive to l1_1, load p2 into t1, then drive to l1_2 and unload. That makes sense.

But the constraints require that at some point p2 is in l2_1. So in this plan, when we load p2 onto a2 at l2_1, that's the state where p2 is in l2_1 (since the load action happens when the package and airplane are at l2_1). Wait, no. When you load a package into an airplane at a location, the package is no longer at that location. So the state where the package is in l2_1 would be before loading. Wait, the initial state has p2 in l2_2. So to get p2 to l2_1, we need to move it there.

Wait, maybe the sequence is: drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_2 (where p2 is), load p2 into t2. Then drive t2 to l2_1. Then unload p2 in l2_1. That would satisfy the first constraint (p2 is in l2_1 in that state). But then, according to the second constraint, in that state or after, p2 must be in a1 or t2. So if we unload p2 in l2_1, then immediately after, p2 is in l2_1 (location), which violates the constraint. Therefore, we can't unload p2 at l2_1. Instead, we need to load p2 into a2 (which is already at l2_1) before unloading. Wait, but how?

Wait, the initial position of a2 is l2_1. So if we bring p2 to l2_1 via t2, then load it into a2. So the steps would be:

1. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_2 (truck movement within c2).
2. Load p2 into t2 at l2_2.
3. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1.
4. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1. At this point, p2 is in l2_1 (so constraint is met here). But according to the constraint, in this state (s), we must have p2 in a1 or t2. But in s, p2 is in l2_1 (location), not in any vehicle. So this violates the constraint. Therefore, we can't unload p2 here. Instead, after driving t2 to l2_1, we need to load p2 into a2 directly. Wait, but to load into a2, both p2 and a2 need to be at l2_1. Since a2 is already there, and p2 is in t2 at l2_1 (after driving), we can load p2 into a2 directly from t2, without unloading. Wait, but can we load directly from the truck into the airplane?

The loadairplane action requires that the package and airplane are at the same location. So if the truck is at l2_1 (after driving), then the package is inside the truck. So to load into the airplane, the package needs to be in the location. So perhaps we need to unload p2 from t2 into l2_1, then load into a2. But unloading would put p2 in l2_1, which triggers the constraint. So after unloading, we must immediately load into a2 or t2. But if we unload into l2_1, then load into a2, that's allowed. Because when unloading, p2 is in l2_1 (triggering the constraint), but then in the next action, we load into a2, so the constraint is satisfied because in the next state, p2 is in a2. So the sequence would be:

3. Drive t2 to l2_1.
4. Unload p2 into l2_1 (now p2 is here, satisfying the first constraint).
5. Load p2 into a2 at l2_1 (now p2 is in a2, satisfying the second constraint because in the state after unloading (s), the next action loads it into a2, so in s, it's in l2_1, but the next state (after loading) it's in a2. The constraint says that in s or after, it's in a1 or t2. Wait, but in this case, after s, it's in a2, which is not a1 or t2. So that would violate the constraint.

Wait, the constraint says: if in some state s, p2 is in l2_1, then in s or some state after s, p2 must be in a1 or t2. So when we unload p2 into l2_1 (state s), then in s, p2 is in l2_1. So the constraint requires that either in s or in a later state, p2 is in a1 or t2. So in the next action, we load p2 into a2. That doesn't satisfy the constraint because a2 is not a1 or t2. So this would be a problem. Therefore, this approach doesn't work.

Alternative idea: use t2 to carry p2 to l2_1, but keep p2 in t2. Because if p2 is in t2 while t2 is in l2_1, then in that state, p2 is in t2, so the constraint is satisfied. But how to get p2 into t2 at l2_1.

Wait, the initial position of t2 is l2_4. So:

1. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_2 (where p2 is).
2. Load p2 into t2 at l2_2.
3. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1. Now, t2 is at l2_1, and p2 is inside t2. So in this state, p2 is in t2, which is in l2_1. So the location of p2 is considered to be inside t2, not l2_1. So the constraint that p2 must be in l2_1 at some state isn't met here. Because the package is in the truck, not the location. So the constraint requires that p2 is actually in the location l2_1. So we need to have p2 in l2_1 at some point, which would require unloading it. But unloading would trigger the constraint.

Hmm. So this seems like a problem. The only way to have p2 in l2_1 is to unload it there, but then we need to immediately load it into a1 or t2. But a1 is in c1's airport. So how can we get a1 to l2_1? We can fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1. Then load p2 into a1. But that's possible.

Let's outline this approach for p2:

- Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1 (c2's airport). Now a1 is in l2_1.
- Then, drive t2 to l2_2, load p2, drive to l2_1, unload p2 into l2_1. Then load p2 into a1. But then, when we unload p2 into l2_1 (state s), we have to then load it into a1 (which is in l2_1), satisfying the constraint.

But flying a1 to l2_1 is an action. Let's see if that's feasible. Yes, because airplanes can fly between airports. So steps:

For p2:

1. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1. (Now a1 is in l2_1)
2. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_2. (p2 is here)
3. Load p2 into t2 at l2_2.
4. Drive t2 to l2_1.
5. Unload p2 into l2_1. (Now p2 is here, triggering the constraint. But then in the next step, load into a1.)
6. Load p2 into a1 at l2_1. (Now p2 is in a1)
7. Fly a1 back to l1_1. (Now a1 is back in c1's airport)
8. Unload p2 from a1 into l1_1.
9. Drive t1 from l1_7 to l1_1.
10. Load p2 into t1 at l1_1.
11. Drive t1 to l1_2.
12. Unload p2 into l1_2. Done.

But this seems a bit long. Also, what about p1? Let's check p1's movement. p1 is in l2_8 (c2). Needs to go to l2_6 (c2). So probably use truck t2 to move it, but t2 is being used for p2. Alternatively, use another truck. Wait, the trucks available are t1 (in c1) and t2 (in c2). So for p1 in c2, we need to use t2. But t2 is being used to move p2. So we have to sequence the actions correctly.

Wait, after moving p2 to a1 and flying back to l1_1, then we can use t2 for p1. Let's see:

For p1:

p1 is at l2_8. Need to get to l2_6. So in c2, use t2 to move it. Steps:

After step 4 (t2 is at l2_1 with p2 loaded?), wait, no. Let me re-examine.

Wait, in the earlier steps for p2, after step 4, t2 is driven to l2_1. Then step 5 unloads p2 into l2_1. Then step 6 loads p2 into a1. Then step 7 flies a1 to l1_1. Then steps 8-12 handle moving p2 to l1_2. Then, after that, we can use t2 (which is in l2_1) to drive to l2_8, load p1, then drive to l2_6. But we need to check if t2 is available.

But let's think about the order. Maybe we can interleave the actions for p1 and p2 to optimize.

But given that the problem requires an optimal (shortest) plan, we need to find the most efficient sequence.

Alternative approach for p2:

Instead of using a1, use a2. Because a2 is already at l2_1. So:

For p2:

1. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_2 (load p2).
2. Load p2 into t2 at l2_2.
3. Drive t2 to l2_1.
4. Unload p2 at l2_1. Now p2 is here (constraint met).
5. Load p2 into a2 at l2_1. (Now in a2)
6. Fly a2 to l1_1. (But a2's initial location is l2_1, which is in c2. So flying to l1_1 (c1's airport) is allowed.
7. Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1.
8. Drive t1 from l1_7 to l1_1.
9. Load p2 into t1 at l1_1.
10. Drive t1 to l1_2.
11. Unload p2. Done.

Now, for the constraints:

In step 4, p2 is in l2_1. So the first constraint is met here. Then, in step 5, we load into a2. So in the state after step 4 (s), the next action is step 5, which puts p2 into a2. Therefore, in state s (after step 4), the condition is met because in the next state, p2 is in a2, which is after s, so the constraint is satisfied.

Wait, the constraint says: if p2 is in l2_1 in state s, then in s or some state after, p2 must be in a1 or t2. But in this case, in state s (after step 4), p2 is in l2_1. Then in the next action (step 5), p2 is loaded into a2. So the constraint requires that in s or after, p2 is in a1 or t2. But a2 is neither. So this violates the constraint. Therefore, this approach is invalid.

Ah, right. So the second constraint requires that after p2 is in l2_1, it must be in a1 or t2. So using a2 would not satisfy this. So we have to use a1 or t2.

So for the p2 part:

If we unload p2 into l2_1 (step 4), then the next action must load it into a1 or t2.

But a1 is initially at l1_1 (c1's airport). So to load p2 into a1, a1 must be at l2_1. So we need to fly a1 to l2_1 first.

So steps for p2:

1. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1. (Now a1 is in l2_1)
2. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_2.
3. Load p2 into t2 at l2_2.
4. Drive t2 to l2_1.
5. Unload p2 into l2_1. (Now constraint is met)
6. Load p2 into a1 at l2_1. (Now p2 is in a1, satisfying the constraint)
7. Fly a1 back to l1_1.
8. Unload p2 from a1 at l1_1.
9. Drive t1 from l1_7 to l1_1.
10. Load p2 into t1.
11. Drive t1 to l1_2.
12. Unload p2. Done.

This satisfies the constraints because after step 5, p2 is in l2_1 (state s), and in the next step (step 6), it's loaded into a1, which is one of the allowed vehicles. So the constraint is satisfied.

Now, for p1: it's in l2_8 (c2) and needs to go to l2_6. So we can use t2 (which is in l2_1 after step 4). So after step 4, t2 is in l2_1. But p2 is unloaded there. So after step 5 (unload p2 into l2_1), t2 is still in l2_1. So after step 6, we can use t2 to move p1.

Wait, but after step 6, we've loaded p2 into a1. So steps for p1:

After step 4, t2 is in l2_1. But after step 5, we unload p2 into l2_1. Then step 6 is loading p2 into a1. So after step 6, t2 is still in l2_1. So after that, we can use t2 to move p1.

So steps for p1:

13. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_8.
14. Load p1 into t2 at l2_8.
15. Drive t2 to l2_6.
16. Unload p1 into l2_6.

But let's see the order. The steps for p2 are steps 1-12, and p1 steps 13-16. But can we interleave them to make the plan shorter?

For example:

After step 7 (fly a1 back to l1_1), we can unload p2 (step 8), then drive t1 (step 9), load (10), drive (11), unload (12). Meanwhile, after step 4 (t2 is at l2_1), maybe we can start moving p1 before dealing with p2's flight.

Wait, but after step 4, t2 is at l2_1. Then steps 5-7 are for p2. So during that time, t2 is still at l2_1. So after step 7, t2 is available. So steps for p1 would be after step 7.

But this would make the plan longer. Let me think of a way to do both in parallel.

Alternatively, after step 4 (t2 is at l2_1 with p2 unloaded), can we start moving t2 to l2_8 for p1? But after step 5 (unload p2 into l2_1), t2 is in l2_1. So after that, t2 is free to move. So perhaps after step 5:

6. Load p2 into a1 (step 6)
7. Fly a1 to l1_1 (step 7)
8. Unload p2 (step 8)
9. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_8 (for p1)
10. Load p1 into t2
11. Drive to l2_6 and unload.
Meanwhile, in parallel, t1 is moving in c1:

But steps 9-12 for p2 require t1 to move. So after step 8 (p2 is at l1_1), drive t1 from l1_7 to l1_1 (step 9), load (10), drive to l1_2 (11), unload (12). These can be done while t2 is handling p1.

So the total steps would be:

1. Fly a1 l1_1 l2_1
2. Drive t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2
3. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
4. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
5. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
6. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
7. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
8. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
9. drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_1 c1
10. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
11. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
12. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
13. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_8 c2
14. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_8
15. drivetruck t2 l2_8 l2_6 c2
16. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_6

But this is 16 steps. However, maybe there's a shorter way.

Wait, after step 4, t2 is at l2_1. So after step 5 (unload p2), step 6 (load into a1), step 7 (fly a1 to l1_1), step 8 (unload p2), then steps 9-12 for t1. Meanwhile, after step 5, t2 is at l2_1. So after step 5, can we start moving t2 to p1's location (l2_8) before handling a1's flight? Let's see.

For example:

Steps 1-5 as before.

6. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_8 c2 (to get p1)
7. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_8
8. drivetruck t2 l2_8 l2_6 c2
9. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_6

Then handle p2's movement:

10. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (but wait, after step 5, a1 is at l2_1, and p2 is at l2_1. So step 6 would be loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1. Then fly to l1_1, etc. But the problem is that after step 5, we have to do step 6 (load into a1) before moving t2. Otherwise, if we move t2 first, then p2 is in l2_1, and we have to ensure that after unloading p2 into l2_1, we load it into a1 or t2. But if we move t2 away, then we can't load into t2 anymore. So the correct order is to load p2 into a1 first, then move t2.

So the sequence must be:

After step 5 (unload p2 into l2_1), we must next load it into a1 (step 6), then fly a1 to l1_1 (step 7), then unload (step 8), then move t1 (steps 9-12). Meanwhile, after step 6, t2 is still at l2_1. So after step 6, we can start moving t2 for p1:

7. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1 (step 7)
8. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_8 c2 (step 13)
9. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_8 (step14)
10. drivetruck t2 l2_8 l2_6 c2 (step15)
11. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_6 (step16)

But steps 7 and 8 can be in parallel? Wait, no, because actions are sequential. So after step 6 (load p2 into a1), step 7 is fly a1 to l1_1. Then step 8 is unload p2 from a1. Then steps for t1. But during this time, t2 can be moving to p1.

Wait, but after step 6 (load p2 into a1), a1 is at l2_1 with p2. Then step 7 is fly to l1_1. Then step 8 unloads p2 there. Then steps 9-12 for t1. Meanwhile, steps for t2 can start after step 6.

So:

1. Fly a1 l1_1 l2_1
2. Drive t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2
3. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
4. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
5. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
6. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
7. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
8. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
9. drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_1 c1
10. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
11. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
12. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
13. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_8 c2
14. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_8
15. drivetruck t2 l2_8 l2_6 c2
16. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_6

That's 16 steps, but maybe there's a way to optimize.

Wait, after step 6, a1 is loaded with p2 at l2_1. Then step 7 is fly to l1_1. Then step 8 unloads p2 there. Meanwhile, after step 6, t2 is at l2_1. So after step 6, can we immediately start moving t2 for p1? So steps 7 and 13 can be in parallel? But actions are sequential. So step 7 must come after step 6, then step 13 (moving t2) can be done after step 7. So:

After step 7 (fly a1), then step 13 (drive t2 to l2_8). Then step 8 (unload p2) can be done while t2 is moving. So:

7. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
13. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_8 c2
14. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_8
15. drivetruck t2 l2_8 l2_6 c2
16. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_6
8. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
9. drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_1 c1
10. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
11. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
12. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

But does this ordering work? Because after step 7, a1 is at l1_1, and step 8 can be done at any time after step 7. So if we interleave steps for p1 and p2, the total steps can be shorter.

For example:

Steps 1-7 as before.

Then:

8. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_8 c2 (step13)
9. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_8 (step14)
10. drivetruck t2 l2_8 l2_6 c2 (step15)
11. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_6 (step16)
12. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (step8)
13. drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_1 c1 (step9)
14. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (step10)
15. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1 (step11)
16. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (step12)

But this way, the plan has 16 steps, same as before. So the order doesn't shorten it. However, perhaps some steps can be reordered.

Wait, after step 7 (fly a1 to l1_1), steps for p2 can be unloaded (step8) and then handled by t1. Meanwhile, steps for p1 can be done in parallel. But since actions are sequential, we have to list them in order. However, maybe some actions can be done in a different order.

Wait, after step 7, a1 is at l1_1 with p2. So step8 (unload p2) can be done immediately. Then steps for t1 (drive to l1_1, but t1 is already at l1_7). So steps would be:

7. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
8. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
9. drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_1 c1
10. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
11. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
12. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

Meanwhile, after step6 (load p2 into a1 at l2_1), steps for t2 can start moving to p1's location.

So steps after 6:

7. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
13. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_8 c2
14. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_8
15. drivetruck t2 l2_8 l2_6 c2
16. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_6

Then steps 8-12 for p2. So total steps would be 16. No improvement.

Alternatively, is there a way to combine actions? For example, after flying a1 to l2_1, then driving t2 to l2_2, etc.

But I think the minimal plan would be 16 steps. But maybe there's a smarter way.

Wait, what if we use airplane a2 for p2 instead of a1? But then the constraint requires that after unloading p2 into l2_1, it must be loaded into a1 or t2. But if we load into a2, that's not allowed. So a2 is not an option. So must use a1.

Another idea: instead of flying a1 to l2_1, can we use t2 to carry p2 to l2_1 and keep it inside t2, thus not needing to unload it. But then, the constraint requires that p2 must be in l2_1 at some point, which wouldn't happen if it's in t2. So we have to unload it.

So the only way to satisfy the first constraint is to unload p2 into l2_1, which requires the subsequent load into a1 or t2. Therefore, the earlier plan seems necessary.

Is there any way to reduce the steps? Let's see:

For p2:

- Fly a1 to l2_1 (step1)
- Use t2 to move p2 to l2_1 and load into a1 (steps2-6)
- Fly back to l1_1 (step7)
- Unload (step8)
- Use t1 to move to l1_2 (steps9-12)

For p1:

- Use t2 to move p1 from l2_8 to l2_6 (steps13-16)

But maybe after step6 (load p2 into a1), t2 is free to move, so steps for p1 can start immediately after step6, before flying a1 back. For example:

1. Fly a1 l1_1 l2_1
2. Drive t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2
3. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
4. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
5. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
6. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
7. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_8 c2 (start moving t2 for p1)
8. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
9. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
10. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_8
11. drivetruck t2 l2_8 l2_6 c2
12. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_6
13. drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_1 c1
14. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
15. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
16. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

This way, steps7 and8 are interleaved. After step6, t2 can start moving to l2_8 (step7) while a1 flies back (step8). But the order matters. The fly action (step8) can happen after step6. Then step7 (drive t2) can happen after step6. So the order would be steps1-6, then step7 (drive t2), then step8 (fly a1).

But the plan would then be:

1. Fly a1 to l2_1
2. Drive t2 to l2_2
3. Load p2
4. Drive to l2_1
5. Unload p2
6. Load into a1
7. Drive t2 to l2_8
8. Fly a1 to l1_1
9. Unload p2
10. Load p1 into t2
11. Drive to l2_6
12. Unload p1
13. Drive t1 to l1_1
14. Load p2 into t1
15. Drive to l1_2
16. Unload p2

This is still 16 steps. I don't think we can reduce it further because each step is necessary. So the optimal plan should have 16 steps. However, perhaps there's a way to optimize by combining some actions.

Wait, when flying a1 back to l1_1 (step8), then unloading p2 (step9), can we drive t1 to l1_1 in parallel? For example:

After step8 (fly a1 to l1_1), step9 is unload p2. Then step13: drive t1 from l1_7 to l1_1. Then load p2 into t1, etc. But that's already the case.

Alternatively, can we drive t1 to l1_1 before unloading p2? Because if t1 is already at l1_1 when p2 is unloaded, then we can load immediately.

But initially, t1 is at l1_7. So steps:

After step8 (fly a1 to l1_1), step9 is drive t1 to l1_1. Then step10 unload p2 from a1. Then load into t1. But this might save a step.

Wait:

Original steps after flying a1 to l1_1:

8. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
9. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
10. drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_1
11. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
12. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2
13. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

But if we drive t1 first before unloading:

8. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
9. drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_1
10. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
11. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
12. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2
13. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

This reduces the steps by one, because unloading after driving. So steps9 and10 can be swapped. But can you unload after driving? Because after flying, a1 is at l1_1. Then driving t1 to l1_1 (step9), then unloading p2 (step10) is possible.

Yes, because after flying, a1 is at l1_1. Then drive t1 to l1_1 (which is allowed, since it's in the same city). Then unload p2 from a1 (which is at l1_1). Then load into t1. This would save a step. So instead of:

Original steps 9-12:

9. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
10. drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_1
11. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
12. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2
13. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

With new steps:

9. drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_1
10. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
11. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
12. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2
13. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

This saves one step (from 5 steps to 4 for p2's movement in c1). So the total steps become 15.

Let me recount the entire plan with this optimization:

1. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
2. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2
3. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
4. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
5. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
6. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
7. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_8 c2
8. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
9. drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_1 c1
10. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
11. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
12. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
13. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
14. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_8
15. drivetruck t2 l2_8 l2_6 c2
16. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_6

Wait, no. After step7, t2 is at l2_8. Then step14 is load p1 into t2. Then step15 is drive to l2_6. Then step16 unload.

But what about steps8-13: after step7 (t2 at l2_8), steps8 is fly a1 to l1_1, step9 drive t1 to l1_1, step10 unload p2, step11 load into t1, step12 drive to l1_2, step13 unload.

So total steps are 16. Hmm, but by swapping steps9 and10, it doesn't save a step. Because step9 is drive t1, step10 is unload p2, step11 load, etc. So it's still 5 steps for that part. Wait, no:

Original:

8. fly
9. unload
10. drive t1
11. load
12. drive
13. unload

That's 6 steps (8-13). With swapping:

8. fly
9. drive t1
10. unload
11. load
12. drive
13. unload

That's 6 steps as well. So no reduction. So maybe there's no step reduction here.

Alternatively, perhaps the loading and unloading can be done in fewer steps. For example, if t1 is already at l1_1, we wouldn't need to drive it. But t1 starts at l1_7.

Another angle: can we fly a1 to l2_1, load p2, fly back, and during that time, use t2 to move p1, while t1 is moving towards l1_1.

But I think the initial plan with 16 steps is the minimal. Let's check again.

Another possibility: after step6 (load p2 into a1), fly a1 to l1_1, and while it's flying, t2 starts moving to p1. So steps:

1. fly a1 l1_1 l2_1
2. drive t2 l2_4 l2_2
3. load p2 t2 l2_2
4. drive t2 l2_2 l2_1
5. unload p2 l2_1
6. load p2 a1 l2_1
7. fly a1 l2_1 l1_1
8. unload p2 a1 l1_1
9. drive t1 l1_7 l1_1
10. load p2 t1 l1_1
11. drive t1 l1_1 l1_2
12. unload p2 t1 l1_2
13. drive t2 l2_1 l2_8
14. load p1 t2 l2_8
15. drive t2 l2_8 l2_6
16. unload p1 t2 l2_6

Yes, this is 16 steps. So I think this is the minimal plan. It meets all constraints:

- p2 is in l2_1 at step5 (unloaded), then loaded into a1 at step6, satisfying the second constraint.

Now, to verify:

- Step5: unload p2 into l2_1. This satisfies the first constraint that p2 is in l2_1 at some state.

- At this state (after step5), p2 is in l2_1. The second constraint requires that in this state or after, p2 is in a1 or t2. In step6, p2 is loaded into a1, which is after step5. So the constraint is satisfied.

For p1:

- Steps13-16 move p1 from l2_8 to l2_6 using t2.

All preconditions and effects are met. Each action's preconditions are checked:

- For example, step6: loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1. At this point, a1 is at l2_1 (due to step1), and p2 is at l2_1 (due to step5). So the precondition is met.

Step7: fly a1 from l2_1 to l1_1. a1 is at l2_1, so allowed.

Step9: drive t1 from l1_7 to l1_1. Both in c1.

Yes, this plan should be valid.
