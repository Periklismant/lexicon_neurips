Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. Hmm, the goal is to get p1 to l1_4 and p2 to l2_4. The constraints say that for p2 to be in l2_4, it must have been in either l2_2 or l1_5 before. Let me check the initial state first.

Looking at the initial state: p1 is in l2_2 (city c2), p2 is in l2_3 (city c2). Trucks t1 is in l1_4 (city c1), t2 is in l2_2 (city c2). Airplanes a1 is in l1_1 (c1's airport), a2 is in l2_1 (c2's airport). 

First, for p1: it starts in l2_2 (c2). We need to get it to l1_4 (c1). Since cities are connected via airplanes, maybe use a1 or a2. But how? Let's see. To move between cities, we need an airplane. So, p1 needs to be loaded onto an airplane in c2, flown to c1, then transported via truck. But wait, initial location of a1 is l1_1 (c1), a2 is l2_1 (c2). So maybe use a2 to fly p1 from c2 to c1's airport, then truck to l1_4.

Wait, p1 is in l2_2. To get it to an airplane, we need a truck to carry it to the airport. In c2, the airport is l2_1. So first, move p1 from l2_2 to l2_1 using truck t2 (since t2 is in l2_2). Load p1 into t2, drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1, then unload p1 at l2_1. Then load p1 onto airplane a2, fly a2 to l1_1 (c1's airport). Then in c1, use truck t1 (which is at l1_4) to drive to l1_1, load p1, drive back to l1_4, unload. That could work.

Now for p2: starts in l2_3, needs to go to l2_4. Both are in c2. So maybe use truck t2. But wait, t2 is initially in l2_2. But p2 is in l2_3. So first, drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_3, load p2, drive to l2_4, unload. But wait, the constraint says that before p2 is in l2_4, it must have been in l2_2 or l1_5. So the direct plan of moving p2 from l2_3 to l2_4 via truck would require that in some state before, p2 was in l2_2 or l1_5. But initially, p2 is in l2_3. So if we move it directly to l2_4, that doesn't satisfy the constraint. So we need to first get p2 to l2_2 or l1_5, then to l2_4.

Hmm, so possible approach: move p2 from l2_3 to l2_2, then to l2_4. Let's see. Using truck t2. Since t2 is in l2_2 initially. Wait, no: initial state says "Package t2 is in location l2_2" — wait, no, t2 is a truck. The original state says "Package t1 is in location l1_4", "Package t2 is in location l2_2". Wait, that can't be right. Wait, the original state lists "Package t1 is in location l1_4" — but t1 is a truck. Wait, maybe that's a typo? Because in the objects, "truck t1", "truck t2" are listed. So maybe the original state entries for t1 and t2 are incorrect. Because "Package t1" would imply t1 is a package, but t1 is a truck. This is confusing. Let me recheck the original state.

Original state entries:
- "Package t1 is in location l1_4"
- "Package t2 is in location l2_2"
- "Package p1 is in location l2_2"
- "Package p2 is in location l2_3"
- "Package a1 is in location l1_1"
- "Package a2 is in location l2_1"

Wait, this can't be right. Because the objects include trucks t1 and t2, airplanes a1 and a2, and packages p1 and p2. So the original state is stating that the trucks (t1, t2) and airplanes (a1, a2) are packages? That's impossible. Wait, maybe there's a mistake in the original state description. For example, maybe "Truck t1 is in location l1_4" instead of "Package t1...". Similarly for airplanes. Otherwise, the problem is inconsistent because trucks and airplanes are supposed to be vehicles, not packages.

Assuming that this is a typo, and the correct initial positions are:

- "Truck t1 is in location l1_4"
- "Truck t2 is in location l2_2"
- "Airplane a1 is in location l1_1"
- "Airplane a2 is in location l2_1"

Otherwise, if t1 is a package, but the problem defines trucks t1 and t2, then there's a conflict. So I think the original state entries for t1, t2, a1, a2 are typos, and they should be the vehicles, not packages. So correcting that:

Original state (corrected):
- "Truck t1 is in location l1_4"
- "Truck t2 is in location l2_2"
- "Airplane a1 is in location l1_1"
- "Airplane a2 is in location l2_1"
- "Package p1 is in location l2_2"
- "Package p2 is in location l2_3"

That makes sense. So, with that in mind, let's proceed.

For p1: in l2_2 (c2), need to get to l1_4 (c1). So steps:

1. Load p1 into truck t2 at l2_2 (since t2 is already there).
2. Drive t2 to l2_1 (the airport in c2) — because airplanes can only move between airports. So drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1 (city c2).
3. Unload p1 at l2_1.
4. Load p1 into airplane a2 (which is at l2_1).
5. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1 (c1's airport).
6. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1.
7. Load p1 into truck t1 (but wait, t1 is in l1_4. So need to drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1. But can trucks move within the same city? Yes, drivetruck allows moving between locations in the same city. So drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1 (city c1).
8. Load p1 into t1 at l1_1.
9. Drive t1 back to l1_4.
10. Unload p1 at l1_4.

That's p1 done.

For p2: starts at l2_3 (c2), needs to go to l2_4 (c2). The constraint is that before p2 is in l2_4, it must have been in l2_2 or l1_5. So, to satisfy this, we need to first move p2 to l2_2 or l1_5. Since l2_2 is in c2 and l1_5 is in c1. Moving to l2_2 is easier. Let's do that.

So for p2:

1. Move truck t2 (which was initially at l2_2, but after moving to l2_1 for p1's transport, is at l2_1). Wait, but after handling p1, t2 would have been driven to l2_1. So after step 2 (drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2), t2 is at l2_1. Then we unload p1 there, then load p1 into a2 and fly away. But for p2, we need to get it to l2_2 first. But t2 is now at l2_1. So perhaps after handling p1's flight, we need to drive t2 back to l2_3 via l2_2. Wait, but let's think.

Alternatively, maybe handle p2 first. Let's see. The steps for p1 involve using t2, which is in l2_2. But if we first handle p2, maybe that's possible. Let me think.

Wait, but the two packages are in different cities. Let's see.

p1 is in c2, needs to go to c1. p2 is in c2, needs to stay in c2 but go to l2_4. So maybe handle p2 first.

But the order might not matter as long as the constraints are met. Let's think about p2's movement.

Option: Use truck t2 (initially at l2_2) to pick up p2 from l2_3. But t2 is in l2_2. So drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_3 (c2), load p2, drive to l2_2 (satisfy the constraint that p2 was in l2_2 before l2_4), then drive to l2_4. But how?

Wait, the constraint says that in some state before p2 is in l2_4, it must have been in l2_2 or l1_5. So if we first move p2 to l2_2, then to l2_4, that satisfies the constraint.

So steps for p2:

1. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_3 (c2) — possible since both are in c2.
2. Load p2 into t2 at l2_3.
3. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_2 (so now p2 is in l2_2, satisfying the constraint).
4. Unload p2 at l2_2.
5. Then load p2 again into t2, drive to l2_4, and unload. 

But that's two extra steps. Alternatively, could drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_4 directly, but that wouldn't meet the constraint. So we need to pass through l2_2 or l1_5. Since l1_5 is in c1, that's a different city. So moving p2 to l1_5 would require using an airplane, which is more steps. So better to go via l2_2.

So steps for p2:

- Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_3 (load p2), then drive back to l2_2 (unload), then drive to l2_4 (load again). Wait, but that's inefficient. Let's see:

Alternatively, after moving p2 to l2_2, we can load it into t2 there and then drive to l2_4. So:

1. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_3 (c2).
2. Load p2 into t2 at l2_3.
3. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_2.
4. Unload p2 at l2_2. Now, p2 is in l2_2. (This satisfies the constraint for the later state where p2 is in l2_4.)
5. Load p2 into t2 again at l2_2.
6. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_4.
7. Unload p2 at l2_4.

That works. So the constraint is met because in step 4, p2 is in l2_2, which is before step 7 when it's in l2_4.

But now, how does this fit with handling p1? Because t2 is used for both p1 and p2. Let's see.

The initial position of t2 is l2_2. Let's process p1 first:

For p1:

1. Load p1 into t2 at l2_2.
2. Drive t2 to l2_1.
3. Unload p1 at l2_1.
4. Load p1 into a2 at l2_1.
5. Fly a2 to l1_1.
6. Unload p1 at l1_1.
7. Drive t1 (which is at l1_4) to l1_1.
8. Load p1 into t1.
9. Drive t1 back to l1_4.
10. Unload p1.

But after step 2, t2 is at l2_1. Then, after unloading p1 (step3), t2 is still at l2_1. Then, for p2's steps, we need to use t2. But for p2's first steps, we need to drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_3. But if t2 is at l2_1 after handling p1, then we need to drive it back. So that adds steps. Let's see.

Alternatively, maybe process p2 first, then p1. Let's try that.

Process p2 first:

1. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_3.
2. Load p2 into t2.
3. Drive t2 back to l2_2.
4. Unload p2 (now in l2_2).
5. Load p2 again into t2.
6. Drive t2 to l2_4.
7. Unload p2. Done with p2.

Then handle p1:

8. Load p1 into t2 (now at l2_4? Wait, after step 6, t2 is at l2_4. But p1 is in l2_2. Wait, initial p1 is in l2_2. So after step 7, t2 is at l2_4, but p1 is still at l2_2. So to load p1, t2 needs to be in l2_2. But after step 7, t2 is in l2_4. So we need to drive t2 back to l2_2. That adds more steps. So steps 8-:

8. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_2.
9. Load p1 into t2.
10. Drive t2 to l2_1.
11. Unload p1.
12. Load into a2.
13. Fly to l1_1.
14. Unload p1.
15. Drive t1 to l1_1.
16. Load p1.
17. Drive back to l1_4.
18. Unload.

That's a lot of steps. Maybe there's a better way.

Alternatively, can we interleave the steps for p1 and p2?

But the optimal plan needs to be as short as possible. Let's think again.

Maybe handle p2 first but find a way that doesn't require moving t2 back and forth so much.

Wait, after moving p2 to l2_2 (steps 1-4), then drive t2 to l2_4. But how?

Wait, after step 4 (p2 is in l2_2), load p2 into t2 again, then drive to l2_4 and unload. So steps 5-7. Then, t2 is in l2_4. To handle p1, which is in l2_2, we need t2 to go back to l2_2. So:

8. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_2.
9. Load p1 into t2.
10. Drive to l2_1.
11. Unload p1.
12. Load into a2.
13. Fly to l1_1.
14. Unload.
15. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1.
16. Load p1.
17. Drive back to l1_4.
18. Unload.

That's 18 steps. But perhaps there's a way to optimize.

Alternative approach for p1: Can we use airplane a1 in c1? But a1 is at l1_1. To use a1, we need to fly it to c2's airport, load p1, then fly back. But initially, a1 is in l1_1. So:

1. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1 (c2's airport).
2. Load p1 into a1 at l2_1. But p1 is in l2_2. So need to get p1 to l2_1 first using truck t2.

So steps:

For p1:

1. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_2 (wait, no. t2 is already at l2_2. So load p1 into t2.
But t2 is at l2_2, and p1 is at l2_2. So:

1. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2.
2. Drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2.
3. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1.
4. Loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1.
5. Flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.
6. Unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1.
7. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1.
8. Loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1.
9. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1.
10. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4.

That's 10 steps for p1.

For p2:

1. Drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2. (But after handling p1, t2 is at l2_1. So after step 3, t2 is at l2_1. So to handle p2, need to drive t2 back to l2_2, then to l2_3. Let's see.

Wait, after step 2, t2 is at l2_1 (c2). Then step 3 unloads p1 there. Then, for p2, need to get t2 back to l2_3. So:

For p2:

11. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2. (Drive back to l2_2)
12. Drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2.
13. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3.
14. Drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2. (Now p2 is in l2_2)
15. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2. (Now p2 is in l2_2, satisfying the constraint)
16. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2.
17. Drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2.
18. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4.

Total steps for both packages: 18. But this seems long. Can we optimize?

Wait, after step 3 (unloading p1 at l2_1), t2 is at l2_1. To handle p2, need to move it to l2_3. But that's in c2. So:

Alternatively, maybe after unloading p1 at l2_1 (step3), drive t2 back to l2_3 via l2_2. But how?

Wait, p2 is in l2_3. So steps for p2:

After step 3 (p1 unloaded at l2_1):

11. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2. (t2 returns to l2_2)
12. Drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2. (go to l2_3)
13. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3.
14. Drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2. (bring p2 to l2_2)
15. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2. (now p2 is here)
16. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2.
17. Drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2.
18. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4.

So that's 8 steps for p2, plus 10 for p1: total 18 steps. Is there a way to combine steps or find a shorter path?

Alternatively, maybe after step 3 (unload p1 at l2_1), instead of moving t2 back to l2_2, can we use another truck? But in c2, only t2 is available. So no. So must use t2.

Another idea: When handling p2, after driving t2 to l2_3, load p2 and drive directly to l2_4. But this would violate the constraint unless p2 was in l2_2 or l1_5 before. So to meet the constraint, we have to first move p2 to one of those locations.

Wait, the constraint says that if p2 is in l2_4 in some state, there must be an earlier state where p2 was in l2_2 or l1_5. So, during the transportation of p2 from l2_3 to l2_4, if we take a path that goes through l2_2, then in that step, p2 would be in l2_2.

For example:

1. Load p2 into t2 at l2_3.
2. Drive t2 to l2_2 (unload there), then drive to l2_4. But that requires two drives. Alternatively, if the truck can go from l2_3 to l2_4 via l2_2, but I think each drive action is between two locations. So the truck must drive from l2_3 to l2_2, then to l2_4. But that would require two drive actions. So in this case, p2 is in l2_2 during the intermediate step, satisfying the constraint.

So steps for p2:

1. Drive t2 from l2_1 (after handling p1) to l2_2. (step11)
2. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_3. (step12)
3. Load p2. (step13)
4. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_2. (step14)
5. Unload p2 (step15), then load again (step16) and drive to l2_4 (step17), unload (step18). 

Alternatively, after step14 (arrive at l2_2 with p2 in truck), unload p2 (step15), then load again (step16) and drive to l2_4. But that's adding steps. 

Alternatively, after step14 (arrive at l2_2 with p2 in truck), instead of unloading, just drive to l2_4. Because the truck is at l2_2, and p2 is in it. Driving to l2_4, then unloading. So:

Steps for p2:

11. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2.
12. Drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2.
13. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3.
14. Drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2. (now t2 is at l2_2 with p2)
15. Drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2. (drive to l2_4)
16. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4.

But here, during step14, p2 is in t2 at l2_2. So the condition is met because in the state after step14 (when the truck is at l2_2 with p2), the package is in l2_2 (inside the truck, but the location of the truck is l2_2, so when unloaded, it would be there). However, the constraint requires that in some state before p2 is in l2_4, it was in l2_2 or l1_5. So in this case, during step14, even though p2 is in the truck at l2_2, does that count as p2 being in l2_2? No, because the package is in the truck, not the location. To have p2 in l2_2, we need to unload it there. So the constraint requires that p2 is situated in l2_2 or l1_5 in some prior state. So unless we unload it, the constraint isn't met. Therefore, we must unload p2 in l2_2 or l1_5.

So the correct approach is to unload p2 in l2_2, which satisfies the constraint, then load it again and drive to l2_4. So steps:

11. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2.
12. Drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2.
13. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3.
14. Drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2.
15. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2. (now p2 is in l2_2)
16. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2.
17. Drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2.
18. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4.

This way, step15 satisfies the constraint.

Now, combining this with the steps for p1, the total plan would have 18 steps. But maybe there's a way to optimize.

Wait, let's look at the steps for p1 again:

1. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2.
2. Drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2.
3. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1.
4. Loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1.
5. Flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.
6. Unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1.
7. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1.
8. Loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1.
9. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1.
10. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4.

For p2:

11. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2.
12. Drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2.
13. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3.
14. Drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2.
15. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2.
16. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2.
17. Drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2.
18. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4.

But steps 11-18 require t2 to move back to l2_2 after step10. But after step3, t2 is at l2_1. Then, step11 is driving it back to l2_2. That's necessary for p2's handling. So total steps are 18.

But wait, maybe there's a way to handle p2's movement while t2 is in l2_1. For example, after step3 (t2 at l2_1), instead of driving back to l2_2, can we use another truck? But the problem states that the only trucks are t1 and t2. t1 is in c1. So no, in c2, only t2 is available. So no.

So the plan must involve these steps. Now, let's check for optimality. Is there a shorter plan? Let's think.

Alternative approach for p2: After p1 is loaded into a2 and flown to l1_1, perhaps use airplane a2 to transport p2 to l1_5 (which is in c1), then back to c2? But l1_5 is a location in c1. The constraint requires that p2 is in l2_4, but if we take p2 to l1_5, then back to c2's l2_4, that would satisfy the constraint. But that would require more steps. Let's see:

For p2:

1. Drive t2 from l2_3 (current position) to l2_1.
2. Load p2 into airplane a2.
3. Fly a2 to l1_5's airport? Wait, airports are l1_1 and l2_1. Other locations are not airports. So airplanes can only fly between airports. So a2 can fly from l2_1 to l1_1. Then, to get p2 to l1_5, need to unload at l1_1 and use truck t1 to take it to l1_5. Then, load back into airplane a1 (if available) to fly back to c2. But this would be very long.

So that's not efficient. So the initial approach is better.

Therefore, the optimal plan is 18 steps. But perhaps I'm missing something. Let's check if any steps can be merged or avoided.

Wait, after step7 (drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1), t1 is at l1_1. Then, after step8 (load p1 into t1), step9 drives back to l1_4. So that's necessary.

Another thought: when unloading p1 from a2 at l1_1 (step6), could we use another airplane to transport it, but since a1 is already at l1_1, maybe not necessary.

Alternatively, after step6, p1 is at l1_1. If truck t1 is already there, but initially, t1 is at l1_4. So we need to drive t1 to l1_1. So steps7-10 are necessary.

So the plan seems to be as short as possible. Therefore, the final answer is the sequence of actions as outlined.
