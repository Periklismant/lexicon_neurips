Let's first understand the problem:

1. We have a logistics domain with cities, locations, airports, trucks, airplanes, and packages.
2. We are given an initial state and a goal state.
3. We have constraints that need to be satisfied.

Initial State:
- Cities: c1, c2
- Locations in c1: l1_1 (airport), l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5
- Locations in c2: l2_1 (airport), l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5
- Trucks: t1 in l1_4, t2 in l2_1
- Airplanes: a1 in l1_1, a2 in l2_1
- Packages: p1 in l1_4, p2 in l1_4

Goal State:
- p1 in l2_1
- p2 in l1_4

Constraints:
1. p1 must be in l1_1 at some point in the plan.
2. If p1 is in l1_1, then there must be an earlier state where p2 is in l2_4.

This means our plan needs to:
1. Move p2 to l2_4 at some point.
2. Then move p1 to l1_1 at some point.
3. Finally, move p1 to l2_1 and ensure p2 is in l1_4.

Let's think through a possible plan:

1. Initial state: p1 and p2 are in l1_4
2. Move p2 to l2_4:
   - Load p2 onto t1 in l1_4
   - Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1 (airport) in c1
   - Unload p2 from t1 in l1_1
   - Load p2 onto a1 in l1_1
   - Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1
   - Unload p2 from a1 in l2_1
   - Load p2 onto t2 in l2_1
   - Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4 in c2
   - Unload p2 from t2 in l2_4

3. Move p1 to l1_1:
   - Load p1 onto t1 in l1_4
   - Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1 in c1
   - Unload p1 from t1 in l1_1

4. Move p1 to l2_1 (final destination):
   - Load p1 onto a1 in l1_1
   - Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1
   - Unload p1 from a1 in l2_1

5. Move p2 back to l1_4 (final destination):
   - Load p2 onto t2 in l2_4
   - Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1 in c2
   - Unload p2 from t2 in l2_1
   - Load p2 onto a1 in l2_1
   - Fly a1 from l2_1 to l1_1
   - Unload p2 from a1 in l1_1
   - Load p2 onto t1 in l1_1
   - Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_4 in c1
   - Unload p2 from t1 in l1_4

This plan satisfies all the constraints, but I need to double-check:

1. p1 is in l1_1 during step 3: √
2. p2 is in l2_4 during step 2, before p1 is in l1_1: √
3. p1 ends up in l2_1 and p2 ends up in l1_4: √

However, I've realized a mistake in the problem description. It refers to "Package t1" and "Package t2", but t1 and t2 are trucks, not packages. It also refers to "Package a1" and "Package a2", but a1 and a2 are airplanes, not packages. Let me reread the initial state:

Ok, so there's a misunderstanding in the problem description. It mentions "Package t1", "Package t2", "Package a1", and "Package a2" in the initial state, but these are trucks and airplanes, not packages. Let me reinterpret the initial state:

- Trucks: t1 is in location l1_4, t2 is in location l2_1
- Airplanes: a1 is in location l1_1, a2 is in location l2_1
- Packages: p1 is in location l1_4, p2 is in location l1_4

This makes more sense. Let's reconsider the plan:

1. Initial state: p1 and p2 are in l1_4, t1 is in l1_4, t2 is in l2_1, a1 is in l1_1, a2 is in l2_1.
2. Move p2 to l2_4:
   - Load p2 onto t1 in l1_4
   - Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1 (airport) in c1
   - Unload p2 from t1 in l1_1
   - Load p2 onto a1 in l1_1
   - Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1
   - Unload p2 from a1 in l2_1
   - Load p2 onto t2 in l2_1
   - Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4 in c2
   - Unload p2 from t2 in l2_4

3. Move p1 to l1_1:
   - Load p1 onto t1 in l1_4
   - Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1 in c1
   - Unload p1 from t1 in l1_1

4. Move p1 to l2_1 (final destination):
   - Load p1 onto a1 in l1_1
   - Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1
   - Unload p1 from a1 in l2_1

5. Move p2 back to l1_4 (final destination):
   - Load p2 onto t2 in l2_4
   - Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1 in c2
   - Unload p2 from t2 in l2_1
   - Load p2 onto a1 in l2_1
   - Fly a1 from l2_1 to l1_1
   - Unload p2 from a1 in l1_1
   - Load p2 onto t1 in l1_1
   - Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_4 in c1
   - Unload p2 from t1 in l1_4

However, I overlooked that p2 is already in l1_4 at the beginning, and that's also its goal location. So, I don't need to move p2 at all. But that contradicts the constraint that p2 must be in l2_4 at some point before p1 is in l1_1. So I do need to move p2 to l2_4 and then back to l1_4.

Let's redo the plan:

1. Initial state: p1 and p2 are in l1_4, t1 is in l1_4, t2 is in l2_1, a1 is in l1_1, a2 is in l2_1.

2. Move p2 to l2_4 (to satisfy the constraint):
   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
   - drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
   - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
   - loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
   - flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
   - unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
   - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
   - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
   - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

3. Move p1 to l1_1 (to satisfy the constraint):
   - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
   - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1 (t1 is in l1_1 now after step 2)
   - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

Hmm, there's an issue. After step 2, t1 is in l1_1 but p1 is still in l1_4. I need to make sure t1 goes back to l1_4 before it can pick up p1.

Let's correct the plan:

1. Initial state: p1 and p2 are in l1_4, t1 is in l1_4, t2 is in l2_1, a1 is in l1_1, a2 is in l2_1.

2. Move p2 to l2_4 (to satisfy the constraint):
   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
   - drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
   - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
   - loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
   - flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
   - unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
   - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
   - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
   - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

3. Move p1 to l1_1 (to satisfy the constraint):
   - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
   - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
   - drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
   - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

4. Move p1 to l2_1 (final destination):
   - loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
   - flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
   - unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

5. Move p2 back to l1_4 (final destination):
   - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
   - drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
   - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
   - loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
   - flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
   - unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
   - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
   - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

Actually, I'm noticing I misunderstood one more thing. I said "a1 is in l1_1 after step 2" but that's not right. Let me redo the plan from scratch:

1. Initial state: p1 and p2 are in l1_4, t1 is in l1_4, t2 is in l2_1, a1 is in l1_1, a2 is in l2_1.

2. Move p2 to l2_4 (to satisfy the constraint):
   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
   - drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
   - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
   - loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
   - flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
   - unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
   - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
   - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
   - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

At this point: p2 is in l2_4, p1 is in l1_4, t1 is in l1_1, t2 is in l2_4, a1 is in l2_1.

3. Move p1 to l1_1 (to satisfy the constraint):
   - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
   - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
   - drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
   - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

At this point: p2 is in l2_4, p1 is in l1_1, t1 is in l1_1, t2 is in l2_4, a1 is in l2_1.

4. Move p1 to l2_1 (final destination):
   - loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

Wait, a1 is in l2_1, not l1_1. I need to fly a1 back to l1_1 first.

   - flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
   - loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
   - flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
   - unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

At this point: p2 is in l2_4, p1 is in l2_1, t1 is in l1_1, t2 is in l2_4, a1 is in l2_1.

5. Move p2 back to l1_4 (final destination):
   - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
   - drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
   - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
   - loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
   - flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
   - unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
   - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
   - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

At this point: p2 is in l1_4, p1 is in l2_1, t1 is in l1_4, t2 is in l2_1, a1 is in l1_1.

This completes our plan. Let's check if it satisfies the constraints:

1. p1 is in l1_1 after step 3: √
2. p2 is in l2_4 after step 2, before p1 is in l1_1: √
3. p1 ends up in l2_1 and p2 ends up in l1_4: √

The plan is valid and satisfies all the constraints.

However, I'm noticing a discrepancy in my solution. In my plan, I have "unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1", but the action should be "unloadplane". Let me check the action definitions again.

Ok, I misremembered. The action is indeed "unloadairplane". Let me fix my plan:

Actually, looking at the problem description again, it doesn't define the actions using the correct format. It says "loadairplane p ap l" but then says "unloadtruck p t l" and "loadairplane p ap l" again for unloading. There's a typo in the action definitions. But based on the context, the correct actions should be "loadtruck", "loadairplane", "unloadtruck", and "unloadairplane".

I'll proceed with the same plan using these actions.

Let me recap my solution:

1. Initial state: p1 and p2 are in l1_4, t1 is in l1_4, t2 is in l2_1, a1 is in l1_1, a2 is in l2_1.

2. Move p2 to l2_4 (to satisfy the constraint):
   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
   - drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
   - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
   - loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
   - flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
   - unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
   - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
   - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
   - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

3. Move p1 to l1_1 (to satisfy the constraint):
   - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
   - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
   - drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
   - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

4. Move p1 to l2_1 (final destination):
   - flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
   - loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
   - flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
   - unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

5. Move p2 back to l1_4 (final destination):
   - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
   - drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
   - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
   - loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
   - flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
   - unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
   - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
   - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

    - a1 is in l1_1
    - a2 is in l2_1

Final state:
- p1 is in l2_1
- p2 is in l1_4

Checking constraints:
1. p1 must be in l1_1 at some point in the plan. This is satisfied in step 14.
2. If p1 is in l1_1, then there must be an earlier state where p2 is in l2_4. This is satisfied from steps 10 to 14.

The plan is valid and satisfies all constraints.

However, I'm wondering if I can optimize the plan further. Let's see...

Actually, we can eliminate a few actions:

Instead of flying a1 from l2_1 to l1_1 (step 15) and then back to l2_1 (step 17), we could use a2 (which is already at l2_1) to directly transport p1 to l2_1. This would save us steps 15 and 17, and potentially reduce our plan by 2 steps. However, to do this, we'd have to fly a2 to l1_1, which would add back 1 step.

So the total actions would reduce by 1 if we use a2 instead of a1 at steps 15, 16, 17.

Actually, let me reconsider. I misunderstood where a2 actually is. Based on my statement, a2 is in l2_1, which is correct based on the initial state. However, I don't remember using a2 in the plan so it stays there. So, we could use a2 to transport p1 directly from l1_1 to l2_1, which would save us 1 step. But I'm not sure if this is the most optimal plan.

Let me check the current plan length:
- Steps 2-10: Move p2 to l2_4 (9 steps)
- Steps 11-14: Move p1 to l1_1 (4 steps)
- Steps 15-18: Move p1 to l2_1 (4 steps)
- Steps 19-27: Move p2 back to l1_4 (9 steps)
Total: 26 steps

If we use a2 instead of a1 for p1:
- Steps 2-10: Move p2 to l2_4 (9 steps)
- Steps 11-14: Move p1 to l1_1 (4 steps)
- New steps: Use a2 to move p1 to l2_1 (3 steps: loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1, flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1, unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1)
- Steps 19-27: Move p2 back to l1_4 (9 steps)
Total: 25 steps

This saves us 1 step. But are there more optimizations we can make?

Actually, after thinking it through, I think the optimized plan I just outlined is likely the optimal plan for this problem. We've shaved off 1 step by using airplane a2 more efficiently.

So, the final optimal plan is:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
4. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
6. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
7. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
8. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
9. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
10. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
11. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
12. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
13. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
14. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
15. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
16. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
17. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
18. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
19. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
20. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
21. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
22. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
23. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
24. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
25. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

Wait, I forgot that a2 is already in l2_1. We can't directly use it to transport p1 from l1_1 to l2_1 without first flying it to l1_1. This would add a step, making our plan 26 steps again, which is the same length as our original plan. So, there's no real advantage to using a2 over a1 in this particular case.

However, after clarifying that, I notice another optimization: after step 10, we've already moved p2 to l2_4, which satisfies the first part of the constraint. Then, in steps 11-14, we move p1 to l1_1, which satisfies the second part of the constraint. From that point on, we could potentially devise a more direct plan to reach the goal state.

Actually, I realized another optimization. Since a2 is already in l2_1, and we'll use a1 to transport p2 from l1_1 to l2_1, perhaps we can use a2 to transport p1 from l1_1 to l2_1. This would avoid having to wait for a1 to return from l2_1.

Let's reconsider the plan from step 14, where p1 is in l1_1, p2 is in l2_4, a1 is in l2_1, and a2 is in l2_1:

15. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
16. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
17. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
18. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
19. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
20. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
21. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
22. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (a1 is still in l2_1 from step 6)
23. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
24. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
25. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
26. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
27. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

This plan still has 27 steps, which is one more than my original plan. But I realized I'm committing a mistake in my optimization. Let's be more principled.

Let's focus on the plan from the beginning:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
4. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
6. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
7. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
8. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
9. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

At this point, p2 is in l2_4, p1 is in l1_4, t1 is in l1_1, t2 is in l2_4, a1 is in l2_1, a2 is in l2_1.

Now, to satisfy the constraint, we need p1 to be in l1_1 after p2 is in l2_4. We could:

10. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (using a2 instead of flying a1 back)
11. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
12. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
13. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
14. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

At this point, p2 is in l2_4, p1 is in l1_1, t1 is in l1_1, t2 is in l2_4, a1 is in l2_1, a2 is in l1_1.

Now, we need to get p1 to l2_1 and p2 back to l1_4:

15. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
16. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
17. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

At this point, p2 is in l2_4, p1 is in l2_1, t1 is in l1_1, t2 is in l2_4, a1 is in l2_1, a2 is in l2_1.

18. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
19. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
20. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
21. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
22. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
23. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
24. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
25. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
26. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

This plan has 26 steps, which is the same length as my original plan. However, it uses a2 more efficiently, and I believe it's a valid and optimal plan.

Let me double-check the state of the world at each step:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

    - a2 is in l2_1

24. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
    - p2 is in t1
    - p1 is in l2_1
    - t1 is in l1_1
    - t2 is in l2_1
    - a1 is in l1_1
    - a2 is in l2_1

25. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
    - p2 is in t1
    - p1 is in l2_1
    - t1 is in l1_4

26. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
    - p2 is in l1_4
    - p1 is in l2_1
    - t1 is in l1_4
    - t2 is in l2_1
    - a1 is in l1_1
    - a2 is in l2_1

Final state:
- p1 is in l2_1
- p2 is in l1_4

Checking constraints:
1. p1 must be in l1_1 at some point in the plan. This is satisfied in step 14.
2. If p1 is in l1_1, then there must be an earlier state where p2 is in l2_4. This is satisfied from steps 9 to 14.

The plan is valid and satisfies all constraints. It is a valid 26-step plan.

Actually, I just realized that if we're going to get p1 to l2_1, we can use a1 which is already in l2_1 by step 9. We can fly a1 from l2_1 to l1_1, pick up p1, and fly a1 back to l2_1. This would be steps 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 in the original plan. We'd save one step because we don't need the extra flight of a2 from l2_1 to l1_1. The total steps would then be 25.

However, but after a follow up think, I realize that still doesn't work optimally! We need to fly a1 from l2_1 to l1_1 to pick up p1, which is the same number of flight steps as flying a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.

Actually, the constraint complicates things a lot. We need to move p2 from l1_4 to l2_4 and then move p1 from l1_4 to l1_1. Then, we need to get the agents to the goal locations: p1 to l2_1 and p2 to l1_4. 

I think I've been overcomplicating this by chasing optimalities that don't exist. Let's go back to the most straightforward, valid plan and see if we can optimize from there.

Here's the general strategy:
1. Move p2 from l1_4 to l2_4 (to satisfy constraint 2)
2. Move p1 from l1_4 to l1_1 (to satisfy constraint 1)
3. Move p1 from l1_1 to l2_1 (goal for p1)
4. Move p2 from l2_4 to l1_4 (goal for p2)

Now, let's be more precise and develop the specific steps of the plan.

Starting state:
- p1 is in l1_4
- p2 is in l1_4
- t1 is in l1_4
- t2 is in l2_1
- a1 is in l1_1
- a2 is in l2_1

I think my final optimal plan is as follows:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
4. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
6. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
7. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
8. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
9. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
10. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
11. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
12. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
13. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
14. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (as this "loadairplane" appears "earlier" in the list of defined actions)
15. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
16. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
17. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
18. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
19. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
20. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
21. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
22. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
23. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
24. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
25. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

This is a valid 25-step plan.

Wait, there's a flaw in my reasoning. After step 9, I have a1 in l2_1 and then immediately I fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1 in step 15, which is impossible. I should account for the state of a1 correctly.

Let me correct the plan from step 10:

10. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
11. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
12. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
13. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
14. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
15. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
16. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
17. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
18. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
19. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
20. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
21. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
22. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
23. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
24. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
25. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
26. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

This is a valid 26-step plan.

Actually, I think I can optimize by using a2 instead of a1 for one of the transports. After step 9:

10. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (using a2 which is in l2_1)
11. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
12. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
13. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
14. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
15. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
16. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
17. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
18. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
19. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
20. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
21. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
22. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
23. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
24. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
25. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
26. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

This is a valid 26-step plan. I used a2 for p1's transportation, but I don't think I've managed to reduce the step count. 

Let me question: can I reduce the step count if I use a2 for p2's transportation from l2_1 to l1_1? Instead of steps 21-23, I could:

21. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
22. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
23. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

But, this doesn't change the number of steps either.

I don't think I can optimize further. 26 steps is likely the optimal plan for this problem, and I've provided a valid plan. No matter which airplane I use for which transport, I need to move p2 to l2_4 first, then move p1 to l1_1, then get p1 to its goal location l2_1, and finally get p2 to its goal location l1_4.

Actually, let's think more broadly. Is it absolutely necessary to move p2 back to l1_4? The goal is to have p1 in l2_1 and p2 in l1_4. Since p2 starts in l1_4, is there a way to never move it?

No, that's not possible, because of the constraints. p1 must be in l1_1 at some point, and before that happens, p2 must be in l2_4. So we must move p2 from l1_4 to l2_4, and then we must move it back to l1_4 to satisfy the goal.

So, my final 26-step plan is as follows:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
4. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
6. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
7. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
8. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
9. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
10. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
11. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
12. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
13. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
14. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
15. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
16. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
17. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
18. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
19. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
20. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
21. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
22. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
23. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
24. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
25. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
26. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

This is a valid 26-step plan that satisfies all the constraints and goals.

Actually, in looking at this plan, I think I might be able to optimize one more time by using a2 (which is already at l2_1) for the first leg of p1's transportation. But I would need to move a2 to l1_1 first. Let's try to replan from there.

Starting state:
- p1 is in l1_4
- p2 is in l1_4
- t1 is in l1_4
- t2 is in l2_1
- a1 is in l1_1
- a2 is in l2_1

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
4. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
6. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
7. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
8. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
9. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

At this point: p2 is in l2_4, p1 is in l1_4, t1 is in l1_1, t2 is in l2_4, a1 is in l2_1, a2 is in l2_1.

10. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
11. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
12. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
13. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
14. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

At this point: p2 is in l2_4, p1 is in l1_1, t1 is in l1_1, t2 is in l2_4, a1 is in l2_1, a2 is in l1_1.

15. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
16. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
17. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

At this point: p2 is in l2_4, p1 is in l2_1, t1 is in l1_1, t2 is in l2_4, a1 is in l2_1, a2 is in l2_1.

18. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
19. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
20. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
21. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
22. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
23. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
24. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
25. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
26. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

This is still a valid 26-step plan. I used a2 for p1's transportation, but it didn't reduce the step count. I've explored several variations, and it seems that 26 steps is the optimal solution for this problem.

Actually, that's not quite right. The problem is with how we structured the plan. We're making the assumption that we must first complete the constraints and then complete the goal, in sequence. But maybe there's a more interleaved approach that could be more efficient.

But given the constraints and the goal, and considering that p2 starts at l1_4 and needs to end up at l1_4, while p1 starts at l1_4 and needs to end up at l2_1, and given the constraint that p2 needs to be at l2_4 before p1 is at l1_1, I think a 26-step plan is indeed optimal, and I've provided a valid 26-step plan.

Actually, as a sanity check, I'll try a completely different plan structure. Let's try to reach the goal first, and then satisfy the constraints separately.

Here's the smallest example:

1. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
3. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
4. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
6. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

At this point: p2 is in l1_4, p1 is in l2_1, t1 is in l1_1, t2 is in l2_1, a1 is in l2_1, a2 is in l2_1.

Hmm, this doesn't work because we still need to satisfy the constraint that p2 is in l2_4 before p1 is in l1_1, so we'll need more steps to satisfy this constraint. So it's not more efficient.

I think my 26-step plan is optimal, and here it is again for clarity:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
4. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
6. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
7. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
8. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
9. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
10. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
11. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
12. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
13. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
14. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
15. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
16. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
17. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
18. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
19. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
20. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
21. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
22. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
23. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
24. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
25. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
26. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
