Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. So, the goal is to get package p1 to l2_1 and keep p2 in l1_4. But there are some constraints to consider. Let me start by understanding the initial state and the constraints.

First, the initial state: p1 and p2 are both in l1_4, which is in city c1. The trucks and airplanes: t1 is in l1_4 (wait, no, the original state says "Package t1 is in location l1_4". Wait, that might be a typo. Because t1 is a truck, right? Wait, looking back: The objects include "truck t1" and "truck t2". So the original state mentions "Package t1 is in location l1_4"—that must be a mistake. Maybe it's a typo and should be "Truck t1 is in location l1_4". Similarly, "Package a1 is in location l1_1"—but a1 is an airplane. So perhaps there's a mix-up in the original state's declarations. That's confusing. Because packages are p1, p2, and the others are trucks and airplanes. So maybe the original state entries for t1, t2, a1, a2 are miswritten as "Package" instead of "Truck" or "Airplane". That's a critical point because if t1 is a truck, then its location is important for moving packages.

Assuming that the original state entries for t1, t2, a1, a2 are incorrectly labeled as "Package" but should be "Truck" or "Airplane". For example:

Original state says:
- "Package t1 is in location l1_4" → Should be Truck t1 is in l1_4.
- "Package t2 is in location l2_1" → Truck t2 is in l2_1.
- "Package a1 is in location l1_1" → Airplane a1 is in l1_1.
- "Package a2 is in location l2_1" → Airplane a2 is in l2_1.

Because otherwise, if t1 is a package, then we can't use it as a truck. So this must be a typo. So correcting that, t1 (truck) is at l1_4, t2 (truck) at l2_1, a1 (airplane) at l1_1 (which is an airport in c1), and a2 (airplane) at l2_1 (airport in c2).

Now, the goal is to get p1 to l2_1 and p2 to remain in l1_4. But the constraints are:

1. At least one state must have p1 in l1_1.
2. If p1 is ever in l1_1, then there must be an earlier state where p2 is in l2_4.

Wait, l2_4 is in city c2. So the second constraint means that if p1 is in l1_1 at any point, then before that, p2 must have been in l2_4. But p2 starts in l1_4 (c1). So we need to get p2 to l2_4 at some point before moving p1 to l1_1. But the final goal requires p2 to be back in l1_4. Hmm, so this might complicate things.

But the final goal is that p2 is in l1_4. So if we have to move p2 to l2_4 first (to satisfy the constraint when we move p1 to l1_1), then we need to bring it back. But that would add steps. But the plan needs to be optimal, so we need the shortest possible.

Let me outline the steps needed for p1 to get to l2_1. Since l2_1 is an airport in c2. So from c1, the way to get a package to another city is via airplane. So p1 needs to be transported from l1_4 (c1) to l1_1 (airport in c1), loaded onto airplane a1, flown to l2_1 (airport in c2), then unloaded. But how to get p1 to l1_1? Using truck t1, which is already at l1_4.

Wait, t1 is in l1_4. So drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1. But l1_4 is in c1, so the truck can drive within c1. But l1_1 is an airport in c1. So drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1. Then load p1 onto t1 at l1_4, but wait, no. Wait, initially, p1 is in l1_4. So to load it into the truck, the truck must be in l1_4. So first, load p1 into t1 while t1 is in l1_4. Then drive t1 to l1_1. Then unload p1 at l1_1. Then load p1 onto airplane a1 (which is at l1_1). Then fly a1 to l2_1. Then unload p1 there. That would get p1 to l2_1.

But then the constraint says that at some state, p1 must be in l1_1. That's satisfied when we unload p1 from the truck into l1_1. So that's good. But then the second constraint: if p1 is in l1_1, there must be an earlier state where p2 is in l2_4. So before p1 is in l1_1, p2 must be in l2_4. But p2 starts in l1_4. So how do we get p2 to l2_4?

Wait, l2_4 is in c2. To get p2 from c1 to c2, we need to use an airplane. But p2 is supposed to end up in l1_4. So moving p2 to l2_4 and then back would require a lot of steps. But maybe we can do that.

But this complicates the plan. Let's think. The optimal plan would require the least steps. Let's see:

Possible steps for p1:

1. Load p1 into t1 at l1_4.
2. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1.
3. Unload p1 at l1_1.
4. Load p1 into a1 at l1_1.
5. Fly a1 to l2_1.
6. Unload p1 at l2_1.

That's 6 steps. But during step 3, p1 is in l1_1, which triggers the first constraint. So we need to ensure that before this step, p2 was in l2_4.

So before step 3 (unload p1 at l1_1), there must be a state where p2 is in l2_4. How to get p2 to l2_4?

p2 starts in l1_4. To get to l2_4 (c2), we need to:

- Move p2 from l1_4 to l1_1 via truck t1 (but t1 is already being used for p1). Alternatively, use another truck. Wait, the trucks are t1 (in l1_4) and t2 (in l2_1). So t1 is in c1, t2 in c2. So to move p2 within c1, we can use t1. But if we load p2 into t1, drive to l1_1, then load into a1, fly to l2_1, then use t2 to drive to l2_4. Then unload p2 there. But then we have to bring p2 back to l1_4. That's a lot of steps. But since the final goal requires p2 to be in l1_4, this back-and-forth would add steps, making the plan longer. So maybe this isn't optimal.

Alternatively, find a way to satisfy the constraint without moving p2 to l2_4, but that's impossible because the constraint requires that if p1 is ever in l1_1, then p2 must have been in l2_4 before. So we have to do that.

Wait, maybe there's a way to get p2 to l2_4 temporarily. Let's outline:

First, move p2 from l1_4 to l1_1 using t1:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

Now p2 is in l1_1. Then load into a1:

4. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
6. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

Now p2 is in l2_1. Then use t2 (which is in l2_1) to drive to l2_4:

7. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
8. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 → Wait, no, after flying, p2 is in l2_1. So steps 6 unloads p2 in l2_1. Then, to get to l2_4, need to load p2 into t2 (which is at l2_1), drive to l2_4, then unload.

So step 7: loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

Step 8: drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2

Step 9: unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

Now p2 is in l2_4. This satisfies the condition for the constraint. Then, we can proceed with moving p1.

But then we need to get p2 back to l1_4. So after step 9, we have to reverse the process:

10. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

11. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2

12. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

13. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (since a2 is in l2_1)

14. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

15. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

Then load into t1 and drive back to l1_4:

16. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

17. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

18. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

That's 18 steps just for p2, plus the steps for p1. But this is way too long, and the optimal plan needs to be as short as possible. So this approach is not feasible. There must be a smarter way.

Wait, the constraint says that if p1 is in l1_1 at any state, then there must be an earlier state where p2 is in l2_4. So we need to have p2 in l2_4 before p1 is in l1_1. But maybe we can have p1 in l1_1 during its transport to the airport. So the step where p1 is loaded into the airplane would require it to be at l1_1, but maybe during unloading, but wait: when you unload a package from a truck into l1_1, that's when p1 is in l1_1. So that step would trigger the constraint. So before that step, p2 must have been in l2_4.

But how can we get p2 to l2_4 before p1 is in l1_1? Let's think.

Alternatively, perhaps we can first handle p2's movement to l2_4 and back before moving p1. But that would require moving p2 to l2_4 and back, which seems time-consuming. Let's see:

Scenario:

1. Move p2 from l1_4 to l1_1 via t1.

2. Load p2 into a1 and fly to l2_1.

3. Unload p2 in l2_1, load into t2, drive to l2_4, unload (now p2 is in l2_4).

4. Now, since p2 is in l2_4, we can proceed to move p1 to l1_1, which will satisfy the constraint that there's an earlier state (step 3) where p2 was in l2_4.

5. Then move p1 to l2_1 as planned.

6. Then bring p2 back to l1_4.

But this adds a lot of steps. However, since the final goal requires p2 to be in l1_4, we have to bring it back. But maybe there's a way to avoid moving p2 to l2_4 and back. For example, can we have p2 in l2_4 temporarily without moving it all the way back?

Wait, the final goal is p2 in l1_4. So if we move p2 to l2_4 and then leave it there, the goal isn't met. So we have to bring it back. So this seems unavoidable. But this would make the plan very long.

Is there another way to satisfy the constraints without moving p2 to l2_4? Let's re-examine the constraints.

The first constraint: "Package p1 is in location l1_1" must hold in at least one state.

The second constraint: If p1 is ever in l1_1, then there must be an earlier state where p2 is in l2_4.

So the only way to satisfy both is to have p1 in l1_1 at some point, and before that, p2 was in l2_4.

Alternatively, can we arrange the plan so that p1 is never in l1_1? But then the first constraint wouldn't be met, which is required. So we must have p1 in l1_1 at some point.

So, given that, the steps for p1 must involve being in l1_1, which means we need to have p2 in l2_4 earlier.

So the plan must include moving p2 to l2_4, then moving p1 to l1_1, and then proceed to move p1 to l2_1, and p2 back to l1_4.

But this seems like a lot. Let's think if there's a way to combine some steps.

Alternative approach:

Use airplane a1 to carry both p1 and p2. Wait, but p2 needs to be in l2_4. Let me try to outline:

First, move p2 to l2_4:

1. Load p2 into t1 at l1_4.
2. Drive t1 to l1_1.
3. Unload p2 at l1_1.
4. Load p2 into a1.
5. Fly a1 to l2_1.
6. Unload p2 at l2_1.
7. Load p2 into t2 (which is in l2_1).
8. Drive t2 to l2_4.
9. Unload p2 at l2_4. → Now the constraint is satisfied that p2 was in l2_4.

Now, proceed to move p1:

10. Load p1 into t1 at l1_4 (t1 was driven to l1_1 earlier, but after step 2, it's in l1_1. Wait, no. After step 2, t1 is in l1_1. So to load p1, t1 must be back in l1_4. But how? Because t1 was driven to l1_1 in step 2. So we need to drive it back.

Wait, after step 2: t1 is at l1_1. After step 3, we unload p2 there. So to load p1 into t1, t1 must be back in l1_4. So steps:

After step 3, drive t1 back to l1_4:

4. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

Then load p1:

5. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

Then drive to l1_1:

6. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1

Unload p1:

7. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 → Now p1 is in l1_1, which triggers the first constraint, and since we had p2 in l2_4 at step 9, which is before step 7, the second constraint is satisfied.

Then load p1 into a1:

8. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

Fly a1 to l2_1:

9. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

Unload p1:

10. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 → Now p1 is at goal.

But p2 is currently in l2_4 (step 9). We need to bring it back to l1_4. So:

11. Load p2 into t2 at l2_4.

12. Drive t2 to l2_1.

13. Unload p2 at l2_1.

14. Load p2 into a2 (which is in l2_1).

15. Fly a2 to l1_1.

16. Unload p2 at l1_1.

17. Load p2 into t1 (which is at l1_1 from step 6).

18. Drive t1 to l1_4.

19. Unload p2 at l1_4 → Now p2 is back at goal.

So total steps are 19, which is very long. But the problem requires an optimal plan, which is as short as possible. So this approach is not optimal. There must be a better way.

Wait, maybe we can have the same airplane transport both packages. Let's see:

Alternatively, after moving p2 to l2_4 (step 9), instead of bringing it back via a2, maybe use the same airplane a1 which is now in l2_1. So steps after step 9:

But wait, after step 9, a1 is in l2_1 (after flying there in step 9). So to bring p2 back, perhaps:

10. Load p2 into t2 at l2_4.

11. Drive t2 to l2_1.

12. Unload p2 at l2_1.

13. Load p2 into a1.

14. Fly a1 back to l1_1.

15. Unload p2 at l1_1.

16. Load p2 into t1 (which is in l1_1).

17. Drive t1 to l1_4.

18. Unload p2 at l1_4.

Then proceed with moving p1:

But in this case, the steps for p1 would start after step 9. Wait, but the steps for p1 would have to happen after p2 is back. No, because p1's movement to l1_1 must occur after p2 is in l2_4. Let's see:

Wait, the constraint is that if p1 is in l1_1, then there's an earlier state where p2 is in l2_4. So as long as p2 was in l2_4 before p1 is in l1_1, it's okay. So maybe we can interleave the steps.

Alternative approach:

1. Move p2 to l2_4 first.

Then move p1 to l1_1, which requires p2 to have been in l2_4 before.

Then move p1 to l2_1.

Then move p2 back to l1_4.

Let's try to outline:

To move p2 to l2_4:

- p2 starts in l1_4.

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
4. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
6. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
7. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (t2 is in l2_1)
8. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
9. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 → Now p2 is in l2_4 (satisfies the constraint's precondition)

Now, move p1:

10. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4 (t1 is in l1_1 after step 2. Wait, step 2 drove t1 to l1_1. So t1 is in l1_1. So how can we load p1 into t1 if t1 is in l1_1 and p1 is in l1_4?

Ah, here's a problem. After step 2, t1 is in l1_1. So to load p1 into t1, t1 must be in l1_4. So we need to drive t1 back to l1_4 after moving p2 to l1_1.

So after step 3 (unload p2 in l1_1), we have to drive t1 back to l1_4:

4. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

Now t1 is back in l1_4. Then load p1:

5. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

6. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1

7. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 → Now p1 is in l1_1, which triggers the first constraint. But before this step (step 7), p2 was in l2_4 at step 9. Wait, no, the steps are interleaved here. Let's renumber:

Wait, the initial steps for p2 are steps 1-9. Then steps for p1 are 10-? But in this approach, after moving p2 to l2_4, we need to move t1 back to l1_4 to pick up p1.

But perhaps the steps are:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1

3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

4. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1 (drive back)

5. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

6. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1

7. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (now p1 is in l1_1)

Then proceed to load p2 into a1 and fly:

8. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

9. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

10. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

11. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

12. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2

13. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 → Now p2 is in l2_4, but this happens after p1 is in l1_1. Which violates the constraint: if p1 is in l1_1 (step 7), then p2 must have been in l2_4 before step 7. But here, p2 is moved to l2_4 after step 7. So that's a problem.

So this approach doesn't satisfy the constraint. Therefore, we need to ensure that p2 is in l2_4 before p1 is in l1_1.

So the correct sequence must be:

Move p2 to l2_4 first, then move p1 to l1_1.

So steps:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1

3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

4. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

6. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

7. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

8. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2

9. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 → Now p2 is in l2_4 (step 9)

Now, proceed to move p1:

10. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4 (but t1 is in l1_1 after step 2. So we need to get t1 back to l1_4.

Wait, after step 2, t1 is in l1_1. After step 3, it's still in l1_1. So to get t1 back to l1_4:

10. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

11. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

12. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1

13. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 → Now p1 is in l1_1 (step 13). Before this, step 9 has p2 in l2_4. So constraint satisfied.

Then move p1 to l2_1:

14. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (a1 is in l2_1 after step 5. Wait, no: step 5 was fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1. So after step 5, a1 is in l2_1. So to load p1 into a1, a1 must be in l1_1. But after step 5, a1 is in l2_1. So we can't use a1 to transport p1 unless we fly it back.

So to fly a1 back to l1_1:

14. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1

Now a1 is back in l1_1.

15. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

16. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

17. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 → Now p1 is at goal.

Now, we need to get p2 back to l1_4. Currently, p2 is in l2_4 (step 9).

Steps to move p2 back:

18. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

19. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2

20. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

21. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (a2 is in l2_1)

22. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

23. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

24. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (t1 is in l1_1 from step 12)

25. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

26. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 → Now p2 is back.

This totals 26 steps, which is way too long. Clearly, this isn't optimal. There must be a better way.

Wait, maybe we can use a different airplane. For example, a2 is in l2_1. So after step 9 (p2 in l2_4), maybe use a2 to fly p2 back. But a2 is in l2_1. So steps:

After step 9:

10. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

11. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2

12. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

13. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

14. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

15. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

16. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

17. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

18. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 → p2 back.

Then handle p1:

But during this time, p1 is still in l1_4. So after moving p2 back, we can move p1:

19. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

20. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1

21. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 → now p1 is in l1_1, which requires that before this step (step 21), p2 was in l2_4. But in this scenario, p2 was in l2_4 at step 9, which is before step 21. So that's okay.

Then move p1 to l2_1:

22. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (a1 is in l2_1 after step 5. Wait, no, in this approach, a1 is in l2_1 after step 5 (fly to l2_1). So to use a1, we need to fly it back to l1_1.

But step 5 is part of moving p2 to l2_1. So after step 5, a1 is in l2_1. So to use a1 for p1, we need to fly it back:

23. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1

24. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

25. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

26. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 → Now p1 is at goal.

This is still 26 steps. Not optimal. There's got to be a smarter way.

Wait, perhaps we can combine the movement of p2 to l2_4 and p1 to l1_1 in a way that shares some steps.

Alternative Idea:

Use airplane a2 to move p2 from l2_1 to l2_4. Wait, no, a2 is in l2_1. But p2 is in l1_4. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe use the same truck to move both packages. For example, after moving p2 to l1_1 and flying to l2_1, then use the same truck t2 to drive to l2_4. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the constraints can be satisfied by having p2 in l2_4 during the plan, even if it's not required for the final goal. For example, moving p2 to l2_4 and then leaving it there would fail the final goal. So we have to bring it back.

This is getting too complicated. Let's try to think of the minimal steps required.

Let's consider that the final goal requires p2 to remain in l1_4. So the only way to satisfy the constraint is to temporarily move p2 to l2_4 and then bring it back.

But this seems unavoidable. So the minimal plan would involve:

- Moving p2 to l2_4.

- Moving p1 to l1_1 (satisfying the first constraint) after p2 is in l2_4.

- Moving p1 to l2_1.

- Moving p2 back to l1_4.

The question is how to do this with the least steps.

Let me try to outline the minimal steps:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1

3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

4. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

6. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

7. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

8. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2

9. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 → p2 in l2_4 (constraint satisfied)

Now, move p1:

10. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1 (drive t1 back to l1_4)

11. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

12. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1

13. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 → p1 in l1_1 (now, step 9 is before step 13 → constraint met)

14. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (but a1 is in l2_1 after step 5. Need to fly back.)

15. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1

16. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

17. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

18. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 → p1 at goal.

Now, move p2 back:

19. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

20. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2

21. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

22. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (a2 is in l2_1)

23. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

24. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

25. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (t1 is in l1_1 after step 12)

26. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

27. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 → p2 at goal.

This is 27 steps. Clearly not optimal. I must be missing something.

Wait, maybe there's a way to have p2 move to l2_4 and back without using airplanes twice. For example, after moving p2 to l2_4, use truck t2 to bring it back to l2_1, then load into a2 and fly to l1_1, then load into t1 and drive to l1_4.

But that's still steps.

Alternative Idea: Use airplane a2 to move p2 from l2_4 to l1_1. Wait, but a2 is in l2_1. So:

After step 9 (p2 in l2_4):

10. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

11. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2

12. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

13. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

14. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

15. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

16. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (t1 is in l1_1 from step 2)

17. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

18. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 → p2 back.

Then move p1:

19. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4 (t1 is back in l1_4)

20. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1

21. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 → now p1 is in l1_1, and earlier step 9 had p2 in l2_4.

22. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (a1 is in l2_1 after step 5. Need to fly back.)

23. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1

24. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

25. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

26. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 → p1 at goal.

This is 26 steps. Still too long.

Wait, maybe we can use airplane a2 to move p1. But a2 is in l2_1. So after step 14, a2 is in l1_1. Then we can use a2 to fly p1 to l2_1.

But after step 14: fly a2 to l1_1. So a2 is in l1_1. So:

After step 15 (unload p2 in l1_1), we can load p1 into a2 and fly to l2_1.

So steps:

After step 18 (p2 back in l1_4), then:

19. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

20. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1

21. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

22. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (a2 is in l1_1 after step 14)

23. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1

24. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 → p1 at goal.

This would save some steps. Let's count:

Steps to move p2 to l2_4 and back: steps 1-18.

Steps to move p1: 19-24. So total 24 steps. Still not optimal.

But perhaps there's a way to interleave the steps.

Alternative Idea: Use a2 to fly p2 back while a1 is being used for p1.

But this is getting too convoluted. Let's think differently.

What if we move p1 to l1_1 without using a truck? No, because p1 starts in l1_4. So must use a truck to move to l1_1.

Wait, but the truck t1 is initially in l1_4. So:

1. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1

3. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 → Now p1 is in l1_1. But this triggers the first constraint, requiring that before this step, p2 was in l2_4.

So before step 3, we must have p2 in l2_4. So how?

p2 starts in l1_4. To get to l2_4, we need to:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1

3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

4. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

6. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

7. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

8. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2

9. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 → Now p2 is in l2_4 (step 9)

Then, proceed to move p1:

10. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4 (but after step 2, t1 is in l1_1. So we need to drive it back.)

10. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

11. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

12. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1

13. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 → Now p1 is in l1_1 (step 13). This satisfies the first constraint because step 9 is before step 13.

Then move p1 to l2_1:

14. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (a1 is in l2_1 after step 5. So need to fly back.)

15. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1

16. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

17. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

18. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 → p1 at goal.

Now, move p2 back:

19. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

20. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2

21. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

22. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

23. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

24. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

25. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (t1 is in l1_1 after step 12)

26. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

27. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 → p2 back.

Total steps: 27. Still not optimal.

This is clearly not working. I must be missing a more efficient path.

Wait, what if we use the same airplane a1 for both p1 and p2? For example:

After moving p2 to l2_4 and then back to l2_1, load it into a1 and fly back to l1_1. But a1 is in l2_1 after moving p2 there.

Alternatively, after step 9 (p2 in l2_4), to bring p2 back:

10. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

11. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2

12. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

13. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (a1 is in l2_1 after step 5)

14. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1

15. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

16. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (t1 is in l1_1 after step 2)

17. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

18. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 → p2 back.

Now, move p1:

19. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4 (t1 is back in l1_4)

20. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1

21. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 → p1 in l1_1 (step 21), which is after p2 was in l2_4 (step 9)

22. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (a1 is in l1_1 after step 14)

23. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

24. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 → p1 at goal.

This is 24 steps. Still long. But maybe this is the minimal possible. However, the problem states that the plan must be optimal, which means it's the shortest possible. So perhaps there's a way to do it with fewer steps.

Alternative Idea: Can we satisfy the constraint by having p2 briefly in l2_4 during the plan, without needing to move it all the way there?

Wait, the constraint is that if p1 is in l1_1, then there must be an earlier state where p2 is in l2_4. So if we can arrange for p2 to be in l2_4 before p1 is in l1_1, even if p2 is moved there and back quickly.

But how? For example, if p2 is loaded into a truck in l2_4 for a moment.

But p2 starts in l1_4. To get to l2_4, we need to move it via airplane and truck.

Alternatively, perhaps use a different airplane.

Wait, there's a2 in l2_1. So after moving p2 to l2_1, load into a2 and fly to l2_4's airport. Wait, l2_4 is not an airport. Airports are l1_1 and l2_1. So airplanes can only land at airports. Therefore, l2_4 is a regular location, not an airport. So to get p2 to l2_4, we must use a truck from l2_1 (the airport in c2) to l2_4.

So the only way to get p2 to l2_4 is:

- Fly to l2_1 (airport), then truck to l2_4.

So the steps are unavoidable.

So maybe the minimal steps are:

For p2 to reach l2_4 and return:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1

3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

4. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

6. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

7. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

8. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2

9. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (now p2 is in l2_4)

10. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

11. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2

12. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

13. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

14. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

15. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

16. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

17. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

18. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (p2 back)

For p1:

19. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

20. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1

21. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (p1 in l1_1)

22. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (a1 is in l2_1 after step 5. Need to fly back.)

23. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1

24. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

25. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

26. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

Total steps: 26.

But perhaps there's a way to overlap some steps. For example, while p2 is being moved back, we can start moving p1.

But this requires careful planning.

Alternatively, after step 9 (p2 in l2_4), we can proceed to move p1:

10. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4 (but t1 is in l1_1. So need to drive back.)

10. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

11. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

12. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1

13. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (p1 in l1_1, which requires p2 was in l2_4 at step 9)

Then move p1:

14. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (a1 is in l2_1. Need to fly back.)

15. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1

16. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

17. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

18. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 → p1 done.

Then move p2 back:

19. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

20. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2

21. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

22. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

23. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

24. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

25. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

26. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

27. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 → p2 back.

This is 27 steps. Still not optimal.

At this point, I'm realizing that due to the constraints, the minimal plan has to involve moving p2 to l2_4 and back, which requires a significant number of steps. However, there might be a way to optimize by reusing the same airplane or truck for multiple steps.

Another Idea: Use a2 to fly p2 back. After step 9 (p2 in l2_4), instead of using a1, use a2 which is in l2_1.

But to do that:

After step 9:

10. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

11. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2

12. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

13. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

14. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

15. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

16. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (t1 is in l1_1 after step 12)

17. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

18. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 → p2 back.

Then move p1:

19. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

20. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1

21. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

22. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (a1 is in l2_1 after step 5. Need to fly back.)

23. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1

24. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

25. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

26. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 → p1 done.

This is 26 steps. Still too many.

Wait, but in step 22, after moving p1 to l1_1 (step 21), we can use a2 to fly p1 to l2_1. Because a2 is in l1_1 after step 14.

So:

After step 18 (p2 back):

19. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

20. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1

21. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

22. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (a2 is in l1_1 after step 14)

23. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1

24. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 → p1 done.

This saves steps 23-26 from previous plan, reducing to 24 steps.

So the steps are:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1

3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

4. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

6. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

7. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

8. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2

9. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

10. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

11. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2

12. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

13. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

14. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

15. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

16. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

17. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

18. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

19. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

20. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1

21. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

22. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

23. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1

24. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

Now, this plan has 24 steps. Is there a way to reduce it further?

Yes! Because steps 10-12 (moving p2 back to l2_1) can be done before moving p1. But perhaps there's overlapping.

Wait, after step 9, p2 is in l2_4. Then steps 10-12 move p2 back to l2_1. Then steps 13-18 move p2 back to l1_4.

But maybe we can interleave some steps for p1 during this process.

For example, after step 9, while moving p2 back, we can start moving p1.

But how?

After step 9:

10. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

11. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2

12. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (p2 in l2_1)

At the same time, we can start moving t1 back to l1_4 to pick up p1:

13. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1 (assuming t1 is in l1_1 after step 3)

14. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

15. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1

16. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (p1 in l1_1)

Now, p1 is in l1_1 (step 16), which requires that p2 was in l2_4 before this. But step 9 (p2 in l2_4) is before step 16. So constraint is satisfied.

Then, proceed to move p2 back:

17. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (a2 is in l2_1)

18. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

19. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

20. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (t1 is in l1_1)

21. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

22. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 → p2 back.

Then move p1:

23. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (a1 is in l2_1 after step 5. Need to fly back.)

24. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1

25. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

26. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

27. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 → p1 done.

But this is still 27 steps. Not better.

Alternatively, after step 12 (p2 in l2_1):

13. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

14. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

15. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

16. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

17. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

18. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 → p2 back.

Meanwhile, after step 3 (p2 unloaded in l1_1), drive t1 back to l1_4 to pick up p1:

4. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

5. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

6. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1

7. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 → p1 in l1_1 (step 7), which requires p2 was in l2_4 before.

But in this scenario, p2 is moved to l2_4 after step 9. So steps for p2 would be:

Steps for p2:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1

3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

4. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

6. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

7. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

8. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2

9. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 → step 9

So steps for p1:

4. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1 (after step 3)

5. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

6. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1

7. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 → step 7

But step 7 is after step 9? No, because step 9 is part of p2's movement. So in this ordering, step 7 for p1 would be before step 9 for p2. Which violates the constraint, because p1 is in l1_1 (step 7) before p2 is in l2_4 (step 9). This is not allowed.

Thus, the steps must be ordered such that p2 is in l2_4 before p1 is in l1_1.

Therefore, the minimal plan must first move p2 to l2_4, then move p1 to l1_1, and so on.

This seems unavoidable, leading to a longer plan.

After several attempts, it seems the minimal plan requires at least 20 steps. But perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Let me try to find a different approach:

The key is to satisfy the two constraints with the least steps.

First, we need p1 to be in l1_1 at least once. During that time, there must have been a previous state where p2 was in l2_4.

So perhaps we can:

1. Move p2 to l2_4 quickly, then move p1 to l1_1.

2. Move p1 to l2_1.

3. Move p2 back to l1_4.

But how?

Alternative Idea:

Use airplane a2 to fly p2 from l2_1 to l2_4. Wait, but airports are only in l1_1 and l2_1. So airplanes can't land in l2_4. So p2 must be trucked from l2_1 to l2_4.

Thus, the steps for p2 to reach l2_4 are unavoidable.

But perhaps we can combine the movement of p2 to l2_4 and p1 to l1_1 in a way that shares some steps.

For example:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1

3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 → p2 in l1_1

4. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

6. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 → p2 in l2_1

7. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

8. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2

9. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 → p2 in l2_4 (step 9)

Now, move p1:

10. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (t1 is in l1_1 after step 2)

But p1 is in l1_4. So t1 is in l1_1, can't load p1. So need to drive t1 back:

10. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

11. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

12. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1

13. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 → p1 in l1_1 (step 13)

Now, constraint is met because step 9 is before step 13.

Then, move p1 to l2_1:

14. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (a1 is in l2_1 after step 5. Need to fly back.)

15. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1

16. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

17. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

18. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 → p1 done.

Move p2 back:

19. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

20. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2

21. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

22. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

23. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

24. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

25. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

26. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

27. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 → p2 back.

This is still 27 steps. I think I'm stuck here. Given the time I've spent and the complexity, I'll proceed with a plan that satisfies the constraints and goals, even if it's long, as I can't find a shorter one.
