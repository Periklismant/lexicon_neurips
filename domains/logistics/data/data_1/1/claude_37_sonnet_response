Let me break down this planning problem:

1. We have two cities, c1 and c2. In each city, there's an airport (l1_1 in c1 and l2_1 in c2) and other locations.
   - Locations in c1: l1_1 (airport), l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5
   - Locations in c2: l2_1 (airport), l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5

2. We have two trucks (t1 and t2), two airplanes (a1 and a2), and two packages (p1 and p2).

3. The initial state:
   - t1 is in location l1_2 (city c1)
   - t2 is in location l2_4 (city c2)
   - p1 is in location l2_2 (city c2)
   - p2 is in location l2_3 (city c2)
   - a1 is in location l1_1 (airport in city c1)
   - a2 is in location l2_1 (airport in city c2)

4. The goal is to have:
   - p1 in location l2_5 (city c2)
   - p2 in location l1_5 (city c1)

5. Constraints: At some point during the plan, p2 must be in location l2_4 AND p1 must be in truck t1.

Let's think through this:

First, let's outline a high-level plan:
1. p1 needs to be moved from l2_2 to l2_5 (both in city c2).
2. p2 needs to be moved from l2_3 to l1_5 (from city c2 to city c1).
3. At some point, p2 must be in l2_4 AND p1 must be in t1.

Let's start with the scenario for p1:
- p1 starts in l2_2.
- We need to get p1 into t1 (constraint).
- But t1 is in l1_2 (city c1), and p1 is in l2_2 (city c2).
- So, we need to either move t1 to p1 or p1 to t1.
- Since trucks can only move within the same city, we need to use an airplane to move p1 to city c1.
- After p1 is loaded into t1 and the constraint is met, we need to move p1 back to l2_5 in city c2.

For p2:
- p2 starts in l2_3.
- We need to move p2 to l2_4 (constraint).
- Then, we need to move p2 to l1_5 in city c1.

Let's work out the detailed plan:

For p1:
1. Move t2 from l2_4 to l2_2.
2. Load p1 into t2 at l2_2.
3. Move t2 to the airport l2_1.
4. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1.
5. Load p1 into a2 (which is already at l2_1).
6. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
7. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1.
8. Move t1 from l1_2 to l1_1.
9. Load p1 into t1 at l1_1. (This meets the constraint that p1 must be in t1 at some point).
10. Move t1 to the airport l1_1 (it's already there).
11. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1.
12. Load p1 into a2 at l1_1.
13. Fly a2 from l1_1 to l2_1.
14. Unload p1 from a2 at l2_1.
15. Move t2 from the airport l2_1 to l2_5.
16. Load p1 into t2 at l2_1.
17. Move t2 from l2_1 to l2_5.
18. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_5.

For p2:
1. Move t2 from its current location to l2_3.
2. Load p2 into t2 at l2_3.
3. Move t2 to l2_4. (This meets the constraint that p2 must be in l2_4 at some point).
4. Move t2 to the airport l2_1.
5. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1.
6. Load p2 into a2 at l2_1.
7. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
8. Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1.
9. Move t1 from its current location to l1_1.
10. Load p2 into t1 at l1_1.
11. Move t1 from l1_1 to l1_5.
12. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_5.

Hmm, I've realized that this plan isn't optimal because it involves a lot of back-and-forth movement. Let me revise and create a more efficient plan:

Wait, let me re-assess the problem. In the initial state, t1 is in location l1_2 (city c1) and t2 is in location l2_4 (city c2). p1 is in l2_2 and p2 is in l2_3, both in city c2.

For the constraint, we need p2 to be in l2_4 AND p1 to be in t1 at some point. This means p1 needs to be moved to city c1 and loaded into t1, and p2 needs to be moved to l2_4.

Let's plan this step by step:

For p1:
1. Move t2 from l2_4 to l2_2.
2. Load p1 into t2 at l2_2.
3. Move t2 to airport l2_1.
4. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1.
5. Load p1 into a2 (which is already at l2_1).
6. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
7. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1.
8. Move t1 from l1_2 to l1_1.
9. Load p1 into t1 at l1_1. (This meets the constraint that p1 must be in t1 at some point).

For p2:
1. Move t2 from its current location (after the steps for p1) to l2_3.
2. Load p2 into t2 at l2_3.
3. Move t2 to l2_4. (This meets the constraint that p2 must be in l2_4 at some point).

Now, to meet the goals:
- p1 should end up in l2_5 (city c2).
- p2 should end up in l1_5 (city c1).

To continue:

For p1 (after meeting the constraint):
10. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1.
11. Load p1 into a2 at l1_1.
12. Fly a2 from l1_1 to l2_1.
13. Unload p1 from a2 at l2_1.
14. Move t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
15. Load p1 into t2 at l2_1.
16. Move t2 from l2_1 to l2_5.
17. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_5.

For p2 (after meeting the constraint):
4. Move t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
5. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1.
6. Load p2 into a2 at l2_1.
7. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
8. Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1.
9. Move t1 from l1_1 to l1_5.
10. Load p2 into t1 at l1_1.
11. Move t1 from l1_1 to l1_5.
12. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_5.

This plan still seems inefficient. The key insight is that, for the constraint, p1 needs to be in t1 and p2 needs to be in l2_4 at the same time. 

Wait, I need to re-read the problem statement carefully. 

Actually, there's an inconsistency in the initial state. The problem specifies "Package t1 is in location l1_2" and "Package t2 is in location l2_4". But t1 and t2 are trucks, not packages. Let me assume that the intention is "Truck t1 is in location l1_2" and "Truck t2 is in location l2_4".

Similarly, I'll assume that "Package a1 is in location l1_1" and "Package a2 is in location l2_1" are meant to be "Airplane a1 is in location l1_1" and "Airplane a2 is in location l2_1".

So, the initial state is:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_2 (city c1)
- Truck t2 is in location l2_4 (city c2)
- Package p1 is in location l2_2 (city c2)
- Package p2 is in location l2_3 (city c2)
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (airport in city c1)
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1 (airport in city c2)

And the constraint is that at some point, p2 should be in l2_4 and p1 should be in t1. The goals are for p1 to end up in l2_5 and p2 to end up in l1_5.

Actually, the constraint isn't that these conditions should happen at the same time, but that they should both happen at some point during the plan. So I need to make sure both happen individually, but they don't have to happen simultaneously.

Let's revise the plan with this understanding:

For p1:
1. Move t2 from l2_4 to l2_2.
2. Load p1 into t2 at l2_2.
3. Move t2 to airport l2_1.
4. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1.
5. Load p1 into a2 (which is already at l2_1).
6. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
7. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1.
8. Move t1 from l1_2 to l1_1.
9. Load p1 into t1 at l1_1. (This meets the constraint that p1 must be in t1 at some point).
10. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1.
11. Load p1 into a2 at l1_1.
12. Fly a2 from l1_1 to l2_1.
13. Unload p1 from a2 at l2_1.
14. Move t2 from l2_3 (after picking up p2) to l2_1.
15. Load p1 into t2 at l2_1.
16. Move t2 from l2_1 to l2_5.
17. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_5.

For p2:
1. Move t2 from airport l2_1 (after dropping off p1) to l2_3.
2. Load p2 into t2 at l2_3.
3. Move t2 to l2_4. (This meets the constraint that p2 must be in l2_4 at some point).
4. Move t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
5. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1.
6. Load p2 into a2 at l2_1.
7. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
8. Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1.
9. Move t1 from l1_1 to l1_5 (t1 is already at l1_1 after we load p1 into it).
10. Load p2 into t1 at l1_1.
11. Move t1 from l1_1 to l1_5.
12. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_5.

But as I look at the plan, I notice that I've made changes to t2's location without properly accounting for its previous state. Let me re-plan this again to ensure the proper sequence of actions.

Actually, there's a little bit of confusion here. Let me re-read the constraint:

"The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'The following conditions are all true: "Package p2 is in location l2_4", "Package p1 is in t1"'"

I was interpreting this as p2 needing to be in l2_4, which would be accomplished by driving t2 (with p2 loaded) to l2_4. But on a closer reading, it specifically says "Package p2 is in location l2_4", not "Package p2 is in t2 and t2 is in location l2_4". So p2 actually needs to be unloaded at l2_4.

Similarly, "Package p1 is in t1" means p1 must be loaded into t1 at some point.

So, the constraint is that at some state, p2 should be unloaded and present in location l2_4, and p1 should be loaded in truck t1.

Let's ensure our plan accounts for this.

Actually, the constraint doesn't specify the exact state or sequence of actions. It only says that both conditions (p2 in l2_4 and p1 in t1) must be true at some point during the plan, not necessarily at the same time.

So, let's revise our plan once more:

For p1:
1. Move t2 from l2_4 to l2_2.
2. Load p1 into t2 at l2_2.
3. Move t2 to airport l2_1.
4. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1.
5. Load p1 into a2 (which is already at l2_1).
6. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
7. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1.
8. Move t1 from l1_2 to l1_1.
9. Load p1 into t1 at l1_1. (This meets the constraint that p1 must be in t1 at some point).
10. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1.
11. Load p1 into a2 at l1_1.
12. Fly a2 from l1_1 to l2_1.
13. Unload p1 from a2 at l2_1.
14. Move t2 from l2_4 (after dropping p2) to l2_1.
15. Load p1 into t2 at l2_1.
16. Move t2 from l2_1 to l2_5.
17. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_5.

For p2:
1. Move t2 from l2_1 (after dropping off p1) to l2_3.
2. Load p2 into t2 at l2_3.
3. Move t2 to l2_4.
4. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_4. (This meets the constraint that p2 must be in l2_4 at some point).
5. Load p2 into t2 at l2_4.
6. Move t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
7. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1.
8. Load p2 into a2 at l2_1.
9. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
10. Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1.
11. Move t1 from l1_1 to l1_5 (t1 is already at l1_1 after we load and unload p1 from it).
12. Load p2 into t1 at l1_1.
13. Move t1 from l1_1 to l1_5.
14. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_5.

But this plan still has inconsistencies in the movement of trucks and airplanes. Let me adjust the plan to account for the proper sequencing.

Actually, to make this clearer, let me form a sequential plan for all actions, making sure that each action follows logically from the previous state of the world:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2 (Move t2 to get p2)
2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (Load p2 into t2)
3. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2 (Move t2 to l2_4, satisfying part of the constraint)
4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (Unload p2 at l2_4, satisfying the constraint "Package p2 is in location l2_4")
5. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (Load p2 back into t2)
6. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2 (Move t2 to get p1)
7. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (Load p1 into t2)
8. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 (Move t2 to the airport in c2)
9. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (Unload p1 at the airport in c2)
10. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (Load p1 into airplane a2)
11. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2 (Move t2 back to pick up p2, which was unloaded there)
12. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (Fly a2 with p1 to the airport in c1)
13. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (Unload p1 at the airport in c1)
14. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 (Move t1 to pick up p1)
15. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (Load p1 into t1, satisfying the constraint "Package p1 is in t1")
16. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (Unload p1 from t1)
17. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (Load p1 back into a2)
18. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1 (Fly a2 back to the airport in c2)
19. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (Unload p1 at the airport in c2)
20. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2 (Move t2 to pick up p1)
21. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (Load p1 into t2)
22. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2 (Move t2 to l2_5)
23. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (Unload p1 at l2_5, satisfying the goal for p1)
24. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2 (Move t2 back to pick up p2)
25. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (Load p2 into t2)
26. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2 (Move t2 to the airport in c2)
27. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (Unload p2 at the airport in c2)
28. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (Load p2 into a2)
29. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (Fly a2 with p2 to the airport in c1)
30. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (Unload p2 at the airport in c1)
31. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1 (Move t1 to deliver p2 to l1_5)
32. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (Load p2 into t1)
33. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1 (Move t1 to l1_5)
34. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 (Unload p2 at l1_5, satisfying the goal for p2)

Wait, I think I made a logical error in my sequence. Let me review the reasoning and ensure that all actions are logically sound.

Actually, looking more carefully, I see that I have t2 in l2_4 and then later move it to l2_3 to pick up p2. But p2 is already in l2_3 in the initial state. So I should have t2 move directly from its initial location (l2_4) to l2_3 to pick up p2. Let me revise this:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2 (Move t2 to get p2)
2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (Load p2 into t2)
3. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2 (Move t2 to l2_4, satisfying part of the constraint)
4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (Unload p2 at l2_4, satisfying the constraint "Package p2 is in location l2_4")
5. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (Load p2 back into t2)
6. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2 (Move t2 to get p1)
7. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (Load p1 into t2)
8. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 (Move t2 to the airport in c2)
9. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (Unload p1 at the airport in c2)
10. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (Load p1 into airplane a2)
11. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (Fly a2 with p1 to the airport in c1)
12. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (Unload p1 at the airport in c1)
13. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 (Move t1 to pick up p1)
14. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (Load p1 into t1, satisfying the constraint "Package p1 is in t1")
15. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (Unload p1 from t1)
16. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (Load p1 back into a2)
17. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1 (Fly a2 back to the airport in c2)
18. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (Unload p1 at the airport in c2)
19. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2 (Move t2 to l2_5, with p2 still in it)
20. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 (Unload p2 temporarily at l2_5)
21. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (Load p1 into t2)
22. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2 (Move t2 to l2_5)
23. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (Unload p1 at l2_5, satisfying the goal for p1)
24. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 (Load p2 back into t2)
25. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 (Move t2 to the airport in c2)
26. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (Unload p2 at the airport in c2)
27. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (Load p2 into a2)
28. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (Fly a2 with p2 to the airport in c1)
29. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (Unload p2 at the airport in c1)
30. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (Load p2 into t1)
31. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1 (Move t1 to l1_5)
32. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 (Unload p2 at l1_5, satisfying the goal for p2)

Hmm, I think I'm still making errors in the movement of t2. For instance, I have t2 moving from l2_1 to l2_5, but then I say "Load p1 into t2 at l2_1". This doesn't make sense because t2 is no longer at l2_1. Let me revise my plan one more time.

Actually, I think there's another issue. I cannot have t2 drive to l2_5 with p2 still in it (as implied by step 19). Let me restructure the plan to ensure all actions follow a logical sequence:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2 (Move t2 to get p2)
2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (Load p2 into t2)
3. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2 (Move t2 to l2_4)
4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (Unload p2 at l2_4, satisfying the constraint "Package p2 is in location l2_4")
5. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2 (Move t2 to get p1)
6. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (Load p1 into t2)
7. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 (Move t2 to the airport in c2)
8. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (Unload p1 at the airport in c2)
9. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (Load p1 into airplane a2)
10. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (Fly a2 with p1 to the airport in c1)
11. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (Unload p1 at the airport in c1)
12. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 (Move t1 to pick up p1)
13. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (Load p1 into t1, satisfying the constraint "Package p1 is in t1")
14. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1 (Move t1 with p1 to l1_5, preparing for p2)
15. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 (Unload p1 temporarily at l1_5)
16. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1 (Move t1 back to the airport)
17. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (Load p1 back into a2)
18. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1 (Fly a2 back to the airport in c2)
19. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (Unload p1 at the airport in c2)
20. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2 (Move t2 to pick up p2)
21. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (Load p2 into t2)
22. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2 (Move t2 with p2 to the airport in c2)
23. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (Unload p2 at the airport in c2)
24. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (Load p1 into t2)
25. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2 (Move t2 with p1 to l2_5)
26. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (Unload p1 at l2_5, satisfying the goal for p1)
27. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 (Move t2 back to the airport in c2)
28. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (Load p2 into t2)
29. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2 (Move t2 with p2 to l2_5)
30. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 (Unload p2 at l2_5)
31. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 (Move t2 back to the airport in c2)
32. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (Load p2 into a2)
33. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (Fly a2 with p2 to the airport in c1)
34. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (Unload p2 at the airport in c1)
35. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (Load p2 into t1)
36. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1 (Move t1 to l1_5)
37. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 (Unload p2 at l1_5, satisfying the goal for p2)

Wait, there's a redundancy in the sequence. I unload p2 at l2_5 and then move it back to the airport, which is unnecessary. Let me further optimize this plan:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2 (Move t2 to get p2)
2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (Load p2 into t2)
3. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2 (Move t2 to l2_4)
4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (Unload p2 at l2_4, satisfying the constraint "Package p2 is in location l2_4")
5. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2 (Move t2 to get p1)
6. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (Load p1 into t2)
7. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 (Move t2 to the airport in c2)
8. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (Unload p1 at the airport in c2)
9. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (Load p1 into airplane a2)
10. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (Fly a2 with p1 to the airport in c1)
11. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (Unload p1 at the airport in c1)
12. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 (Move t1 to pick up p1)
13. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (Load p1 into t1, satisfying the constraint "Package p1 is in t1")
14. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (Unload p1 from t1)
15. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (Load p1 back into a2)
16. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1 (Fly a2 back to the airport in c2)
17. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (Unload p1 at the airport in c2)

I noticed a couple of errors in my plan. Let me revise it once more:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2 (Move t2 to get p2)
2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (Load p2 into t2)
3. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2 (Move t2 to l2_4)
4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (Unload p2 at l2_4, satisfying the constraint "Package p2 is in location l2_4")
5. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2 (Move t2 to get p1)

31. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (Fly a2 with p2 to the airport in c1)
32. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (Unload p2 at the airport in c1)
33. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (Load p2 into t1)
34. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1 (Move t1 to l1_5)
35. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 (Unload p2 at l1_5, satisfying the goal for p2)

But there's still an error. I'm trying to fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1 (step 28) and then again (step 31). I should correct this by consolidating the movements of a2.

Let me try one more time:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2 (Move t2 to get p2)
2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (Load p2 into t2)
3. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2 (Move t2 to l2_4)
4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (Unload p2 at l2_4, satisfying the constraint "Package p2 is in location l2_4")
5. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2 (Move t2 to get p1)
6. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (Load p1 into t2)
7. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 (Move t2 to the airport in c2)
8. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (Unload p1 at the airport in c2)
9. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (Load p1 into airplane a2)
10. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (Fly a2 with p1 to the airport in c1)
11. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (Unload p1 at the airport in c1)
12. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 (Move t1 to pick up p1)
13. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (Load p1 into t1, satisfying the constraint "Package p1 is in t1")
14. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (Unload p1 from t1)
15. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (Load p1 back into a2)
16. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1 (Fly a2 back to the airport in c2)
17. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (Unload p1 at the airport in c2)
18. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2 (Move t2 to pick up p2)
19. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (Load p2 into t2)
20. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2 (Move t2 with p2 to the airport in c2)
21. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (Unload p2 at the airport in c2)
22. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (Load p1 into t2)
23. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2 (Move t2 with p1 to l2_5)
24. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (Unload p1 at l2_5, satisfying the goal for p1)
25. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 (Move t2 back to the airport in c2)
26. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (Load p2 into t2)
27. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (This is a mistake, p2 is already in t2. I should unload p2 first.)
28. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (Unload p2 from t2)
29. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (Load p2 into a2)
30. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (Fly a2 with p2 to the airport in c1)
31. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (Unload p2 at the airport in c1)
32. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (Load p2 into t1)
33. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1 (Move t1 to l1_5)
34. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 (Unload p2 at l1_5, satisfying the goal for p2)

I think the only redundancy left is that I am both loading p2 into t2 (step 26) and then immediately unloading it (step 28). This doesn't make sense. Let me fix this to have a clean, optimized plan:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2 (Move t2 to get p2)
2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (Load p2 into t2)
3. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2 (Move t2 to l2_4)
4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (Unload p2 at l2_4, satisfying the constraint "Package p2 is in location l2_4")
5. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2 (Move t2 to get p1)
6. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (Load p1 into t2)
7. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 (Move t2 to the airport in c2)
8. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (Unload p1 at the airport in c2)
9. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (Load p1 into airplane a2)
10. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (Fly a2 with p1 to the airport in c1)
11. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (Unload p1 at the airport in c1)
12. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 (Move t1 to pick up p1)
13. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (Load p1 into t1, satisfying the constraint "Package p1 is in t1")
14. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (Unload p1 from t1)
15. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (Load p1 back into a2)
16. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1 (Fly a2 back to the airport in c2)
17. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (Unload p1 at the airport in c2)
18. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2 (Move t2 to pick up p2)
19. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (Load p2 into t2)
20. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2 (Move t2 with p2 to the airport in c2)
21. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (Unload p2 at the airport in c2)
22. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (Load p1 into t2)
23. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2 (Move t2 with p1 to l2_5)
24. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (Unload p1 at l2_5, satisfying the goal for p1)
25. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 (Move t2 back to the airport in c2)
26. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (Load p2 into a2)
27. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (Fly a2 with p2 to the airport in c1)
28. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (Unload p2 at the airport in c1)
29. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (Load p2 into t1)
30. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1 (Move t1 to l1_5)
31. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 (Unload p2 at l1_5, satisfying the goal for p2)

I believe this plan is now logically consistent and meets both the constraint and the goals. Let me double-check one more time to ensure there are no logical inconsistencies or redundancies.

It looks good! Here's a summary:
1. We first move p2 to l2_4 to satisfy the constraint "Package p2 is in location l2_4".
2. We then transport p1 to the airport in c2, fly it to the airport in c1, load it into t1 to satisfy the constraint "Package p1 is in t1", and then transport it back to l2_5 in c2 to satisfy the goal for p1.
3. Finally, we transport p2 from l2_4 to the airport in c2, fly it to the airport in c1, and then transport it to l1_5 to satisfy the goal for p2.

The plan is now free of redundancies and follows a logical sequence. I'm now confident in the correctness of this plan.
