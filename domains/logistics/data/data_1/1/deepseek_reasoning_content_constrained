Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this planning problem. So, the goal is to get package p1 to l2_5 and p2 to l1_5. But there's a constraint that at some point, p1 must be in truck t1 and p2 must be in l2_4. Let's break this down step by step.

First, let's look at the initial state. The packages are at l2_2 (p1) and l2_3 (p2). Trucks t1 is at l1_2 and t2 is at l2_4. Airplanes a1 is at l1_1 (airport in c1) and a2 is at l2_1 (airport in c2). The cities are c1 and c2, each with their own locations. The airports are l1_1 and l2_1.

So, p1 is in city c2, and needs to go to l2_5, which is also in c2. But p2 is in c2 and needs to go to l1_5 in c1. That means p2 has to move between cities, probably using an airplane. But first, both packages need to be transported to airports, loaded onto planes, flown to the destination city, then unloaded and delivered via trucks.

But wait, the constraint says that at some state, p2 must be in l2_4 and p1 in t1. Let's parse that. The constraint requires that in at least one state during the plan, both p2 is in l2_4 and p1 is in t1. Initially, p2 is in l2_3, and p1 is in l2_2. So how can we get p1 into t1? Because t1 is in l1_2, which is in c1. But p1 is in c2. So how can p1 get into t1? That seems impossible unless we move t1 to c2. But wait, trucks can only move within their own city. So t1 is in c1, so it can't go to c2. So how can p1 end up in t1? Maybe we need to have p1 transported to c1 first, loaded into t1 there, then maybe transported back? But that seems complicated. Wait, perhaps there's a mistake here. Let me check the initial state again.

Wait, looking back: The original state says "Package t1 is in location l1_2". Wait, that must be a typo. Because t1 is a truck, right? So maybe the correct initial state is "Truck t1 is in location l1_2". Similarly for "Package t2 is in location l2_4" should probably be "Truck t2...". Because packages are p1, p2. So I think there's a mistake in the problem statement. Let me recheck:

The original state of the world is the following:
	"Location l1_1 is in city c1"
	... (other locations)
	"Package t1 is in location l1_2"
	"Package t2 is in location l2_4"
	"Package p1 is in location l2_2"
	"Package p2 is in location l2_3"
	"Package a1 is in location l1_1"
	"Package a2 is in location l2_1"

Wait, that can't be right. Because t1 and t2 are trucks, not packages. Similarly, a1 and a2 are airplanes. So the problem statement here has a mistake. The correct initial positions should be:

Truck t1 is in location l1_2.

Truck t2 is in location l2_4.

Airplane a1 is in location l1_1.

Airplane a2 is in location l2_1.

Because otherwise, the problem is inconsistent. For example, you can't load a truck (t1) if it's a package. So I think there's a typo in the problem statement where "Package t1..." should be "Truck t1...", same for t2, a1, a2. Otherwise, the problem is impossible because the trucks and airplanes are listed as packages, which doesn't make sense. Assuming that's a typo, I'll proceed with that correction.

So initial positions:

Trucks: t1 in l1_2 (c1), t2 in l2_4 (c2).

Airplanes: a1 in l1_1 (c1's airport), a2 in l2_1 (c2's airport).

Packages: p1 in l2_2 (c2), p2 in l2_3 (c2).

The goal is p1 in l2_5 (c2), p2 in l1_5 (c1).

Constraints: At some point, p2 is in l2_4 and p1 is in t1.

But t1 is a truck in c1. How can p1 get into t1? Because p1 starts in c2. So we need to transport p1 from c2 to c1, load it into t1 (in c1), then maybe move it back. But why would we do that? Because the constraint requires that at some point, p1 is in t1. So perhaps during the plan, p1 is loaded into t1 in c1. But how does p1 get to c1?

So steps for p2: p2 needs to go from l2_3 (c2) to l1_5 (c1). That requires moving between cities, so using an airplane. So steps for p2: load into a truck in c2, drive to airport l2_1, load into airplane a2, fly to l1_1, unload, load into truck t1 (but t1 is in l1_2), so drive t1 to l1_1, load p2 into t1, then drive to l1_5 and unload.

But p2's journey: l2_3 (c2) → truck t2? Wait, t2 is in l2_4. So first, drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_3 (can't, because trucks can only move within their city. So l2_4 is in c2. So t2 can drive to l2_3. Wait, cities c1 has locations l1_1 to l1_5, and c2 has l2_1 to l2_5. So t2 is in l2_4 (c2). So to pick up p2 from l2_3 (c2), t2 needs to drive from l2_4 to l2_3. Then load p2 into t2, drive to l2_1 (airport), unload p2, load into airplane a2, fly to l1_1 (c1's airport). Then unload p2 into a1 (but a1 is in l1_1), then load onto truck t1 which is at l1_2. Wait, t1 is in l1_2, which is in c1. So to get p2 from l1_1 (airport in c1) to l1_5, need to load into t1. So steps: drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1, load p2 into t1, then drive to l1_5 and unload.

But for the constraint, we need p1 to be in t1 and p2 in l2_4. Let's see. The constraint must be true in at least one state. So maybe during the plan, p2 is moved to l2_4 (which is where t2 starts). Wait, initially, t2 is at l2_4, and p2 is at l2_3. So if we drive t2 to l2_3, load p2 into t2, then drive back to l2_4. Then p2 would be in t2 at l2_4. But the constraint requires p2 to be in l2_4, which would be the case after unloading p2 from t2 at l2_4. Wait, but the constraint is that "p2 is in location l2_4" and "p1 is in t1". So perhaps when p2 is in l2_4 (maybe after unloading there), and p1 is in t1. But how does p1 get into t1?

For p1 to be in t1, which is in c1, we need to get p1 from c2 to c1. So p1's path: l2_2 → t2 (if possible), but t2 is in c2. Wait, p1 is in l2_2 (c2). To move p1 to c1, we need to use airplane. So first, load p1 into a truck in c2. Let's see, t2 is in l2_4. Drive t2 to l2_2 (possible), load p1 into t2, drive to l2_1 (airport in c2), unload p1, load into airplane a2, fly to l1_1 (c1's airport), unload, then load into truck t1 (which would need to be at l1_1). So drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1, load p1 into t1. At this point, p1 is in t1, which is in l1_1. Then, for the constraint to hold, we need p2 to be in l2_4. How to get p2 to l2_4?

Perhaps during p2's transport. Let's see, p2 starts in l2_3. If we load p2 into t2 (which is in l2_4, so drive t2 to l2_3, load p2, then drive back to l2_4 and unload. Then p2 is in l2_4. But that would be after unloading. But then, after that, we need to load p2 again to move it to c1. So maybe during the process, we first move p2 to l2_4 (by loading into t2 and moving), then move p1 into t1. Then the constraint is satisfied in that state where p2 is in l2_4 and p1 is in t1.

So here's a possible plan outline:

1. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_3 (to pick up p2).
2. Load p2 into t2 at l2_3.
3. Drive t2 from l2_3 back to l2_4.
4. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_4. Now p2 is in l2_4. (This satisfies the p2 part of the constraint.)
5. Now, handle p1's movement. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_2 (where p1 is).
6. Load p1 into t2 at l2_2.
7. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1 (airport).
8. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1.
9. Load p1 into airplane a2 at l2_1.
10. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1 (c1's airport).
11. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1.
12. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1.
13. Load p1 into t1 at l1_1. Now p1 is in t1. (This satisfies the p1 part of the constraint. At this step, after loading, the state has p1 in t1 and p2 in l2_4 (from step 4). So the constraint is met in this state.)

Then, continue with moving p1 to l2_5? Wait, no. Wait, the goal is p1 in l2_5 (c2) and p2 in l1_5 (c1). Wait, but after step 13, p1 is in t1 in l1_1 (c1). How does p1 get back to c2? That doesn't make sense. Because the goal is p1 in l2_5 (c2). So perhaps this approach is wrong.

Wait, maybe I messed up. The goal is p1 in l2_5 (c2), which is the same city where it started. So why would we move p1 to c1? That complicates things. The constraint requires that p1 is in t1 (which is in c1) at some point. But then p1 has to go back to c2's l2_5. So the plan would have to involve moving p1 from c2 to c1 (to get into t1), then back to c2. That's possible but seems inefficient.

Alternatively, maybe the constraint is met before p1 is moved back. Let's re-examine the constraint: it must hold in at least one state. So during the plan, once p1 is in t1 and p2 is in l2_4, that's sufficient. Then, after that, p1 can be moved out of t1 and to its destination.

So steps for p1:

1. Move p1 from l2_2 to l2_1 via truck t2.

2. Load into airplane a2 and fly to l1_1.

3. Unload into l1_1, load into truck t1 (after driving t1 to l1_1).

4. Now, p1 is in t1 (in c1). At this point, the constraint is satisfied if p2 is in l2_4. How to get p2 to l2_4?

5. For p2: perhaps after moving p2 to l2_4 (as part of its journey to c1). Wait, but p2's journey requires moving to c1. So maybe after moving p2 to l2_4 (unloading there), then moving it again to the airport.

But this seems conflicting. Let me think again.

Maybe the steps are:

For the constraint:

- Get p2 to l2_4 and p1 into t1.

How to do that:

- For p2: drive t2 to l2_3, load p2, drive back to l2_4 and unload. Now p2 is in l2_4.

- For p1: transport to c1, load into t1. So steps for p1:

   a. Drive t2 (in c2) from l2_4 to l2_2, load p1.

   b. Drive to l2_1, unload p1.

   c. Load p1 into a2, fly to l1_1.

   d. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1.

   e. Load p1 into t1. Now p1 is in t1 (satisfying the constraint) and p2 was unloaded in l2_4.

So the constraint is satisfied after step e (assuming p2 was unloaded in l2_4 before this).

So combining these steps:

1. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_3 (to pick up p2).

2. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3.

3. Drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2.

4. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4. Now p2 is in l2_4.

5. Now handle p1's movement:

6. Drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2.

7. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2.

8. Drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2.

9. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1.

10. Loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1.

11. Flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

12. Unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1.

13. Drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1.

14. Loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1. Now, at this point, p1 is in t1 (in l1_1) and p2 is in l2_4. So the constraint is satisfied here.

Then, proceed to move p1 back to c2 to reach l2_5. Wait, but how? Because t1 is in c1. So to get p1 back to c2, we need to use an airplane again. So steps after 14:

15. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1.

16. Loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1.

17. Flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1.

18. Unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1.

19. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (assuming t2 is back at l2_1).

But wait, after step 8, t2 is at l2_1. Then step 8 was driving t2 to l2_1. Then in step 9, we unload p1 there. So after step 9, t2 is still in l2_1. So steps 10 and 11 are loading p1 into a2 and flying to l1_1. Then, after step 18, when p1 is back in l2_1 via a1, we need to load into t2 again. Then drive t2 to l2_5.

So steps 15-20:

15. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2. (But can t2 drive directly from l2_1 to l2_5? If they are in the same city, yes. Are l2_1 and l2_5 in c2? Yes. So yes.)

But wait, after step 9, t2 is at l2_1. After that, steps 10-11: p1 is in a2 and flown to l1_1. Then steps 12-14: p1 is loaded into t1. Then steps 15-17: moving p1 back to c2.

Wait, maybe there's a better way. Let's think again.

Once p1 is in t1 (step 14), then we need to get it to l2_5 in c2. So:

14. p1 is in t1 at l1_1.

15. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1. Now p1 is at l1_1.

16. Loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1.

17. Flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1.

18. Unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1.

19. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (if t2 is there). But after step 9, t2 was at l2_1. Then steps 10-11: a2 flies to l1_1, leaving t2 at l2_1. So yes, t2 is at l2_1.

20. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2.

21. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5.

Then p1 is at l2_5, which is the goal.

Now, for p2's journey to l1_5:

At step 4, p2 is at l2_4. Then, we need to move it to l1_5.

Steps for p2 after step 4:

22. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4. Wait, t2 is at l2_1 after step 9, and then after step 20, t2 is at l2_5. Hmm, this is conflicting. Because after step 9, t2 is at l2_1. Then in step 19, we load p1 into t2 (still at l2_1), drive to l2_5 (step 20), unload p1 (step 21). So t2 is now at l2_5. So how do we get p2 from l2_4 to c1?

We need to use another truck in c2. But the only trucks are t2 and t1. t1 is in c1. So in c2, only t2 is available. So after step 21, t2 is at l2_5. To get p2 from l2_4, we need to drive t2 back to l2_4, load p2, then drive to l2_1 (airport), load into a2, fly to l1_1, unload, then load into t1 (which is at l1_1 after step 13), drive t1 to l1_5, unload.

So steps for p2:

23. Drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2. (But after step 21, t2 is at l2_5.)

24. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4.

25. Drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2.

26. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.

27. Loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1.

28. Flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

29. Unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1.

30. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1.

31. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5.

Wait, but t1 was driven to l1_1 in step 13. So after step 13, t1 is at l1_1. Then step 30 is driving t1 from l1_1 to l1_5. Then unload p2 there. But p2 is loaded into t1 when? Because after step 29, p2 is in l1_1. So need to load into t1:

29. Unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1.

30. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

31. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1.

32. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5.

But t1 is already at l1_1 after step 13. Wait, step 13: drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1. So after that, t1 is at l1_1. Then, step 14 loads p1 into t1. Then step 15 unloads p1 from t1, leaving t1 at l1_1. So when we get to step 30, t1 is still at l1_1. So after step 29, p2 is at l1_1. So steps:

After step 29:

30. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

31. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1.

32. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5.

So putting it all together, the plan would be:

1. Drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2
2. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
3. Drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
4. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
5. Drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2
6. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
7. Drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
8. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
9. Loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
10. Flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
11. Unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
12. Drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
13. Loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
   [Now constraint is met: p1 in t1 (step13), p2 in l2_4 (step4)]
14. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
15. Loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
16. Flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
17. Unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
18. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
19. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
20. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
21. Drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2
22. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
23. Drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
24. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
25. Loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
26. Flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
27. Unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
28. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
29. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
30. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

But this seems very long. Let me check for possible optimizations. For example, after step 13, p1 is in t1. Then, steps 14-20 are moving p1 back to c2. But maybe there's a way to combine steps. Alternatively, after step13, can we move p1 directly from t1 to the airplane?

Wait, after step13: p1 is in t1 at l1_1. So instead of unloading p1 (step14), can we drive t1 (with p1) to l1_1's airport (which is l1_1), unload p1 there, load into a1, fly to l2_1, etc. But t1 is already at l1_1. So:

13. Loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
14. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_1 c1 (no, can't drive to same location)
So no, need to unload p1 from t1 at l1_1, then load into a1.

Alternatively, after step13, unload p1 from t1 at l1_1, then load into a1, fly to l2_1, then proceed.

So steps 14-20 are necessary.

But maybe there's a shorter path. Let's see.

Another approach: After satisfying the constraint (steps 1-13), we need to move p1 to l2_5 and p2 to l1_5.

But maybe the order can be adjusted. For example, after step13, the constraint is met, so we can handle p2's transport next.

Wait, but p2 is in l2_4 (from step4). So after step13, p2 is in l2_4. So to move p2 to l1_5, we need to:

- Load p2 into t2 (which is at l2_4 after step4?), but after step4, t2 is at l2_4. Wait, after step4, t2 was driven to l2_4 (step3 was drive from l2_3 to l2_4). So t2 is at l2_4. Then step5: drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_2. So after step5, t2 is at l2_2. Then step7: drive to l2_1. So after step7, t2 is at l2_1. Then step8: unload p1. Then step9-11: p1 is loaded into a2 and flown to l1_1. Then step12-13: t1 is moved to l1_1 and p1 loaded into t1.

So after step13, t2 is at l2_1 (since step7 moved it there). So p2 is at l2_4 (from step4). So to load p2 into t2, t2 needs to be driven back to l2_4. Which would be step21: drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2. But that's a long drive. Alternatively, maybe there's a better way.

Alternatively, when moving p1, after step4 (p2 in l2_4), perhaps t2 is moved to l2_2 to pick up p1, then to l2_1. So after step7, t2 is at l2_1. So to get p2 from l2_4 to l2_1, t2 would have to go back to l2_4, load p2, then drive to l2_1. But that's steps: drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4, load p2, drive to l2_1. So steps:

After step13 (p1 in t1 at l1_1):

14. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
15. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
16. Drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
17. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
18. Loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
19. Flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
20. Unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
21. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
22. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
23. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

Meanwhile, handling p1:

After step13, p1 is in t1 at l1_1. Then:

14. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
15. Loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
16. Flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
17. Unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
18. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (but t2 is at l2_4 in step14-16. Wait, this conflicts with the steps for p2.

This is getting complicated. Perhaps the optimal plan is as I outlined earlier, but maybe there's a way to reduce steps by reusing the airplane a2 for both packages.

Alternatively, perhaps using a different order. Let's try to make the plan step-by-step again, ensuring the constraint is met and the goals are achieved with minimal steps.

First, handle the constraint: need p2 in l2_4 and p1 in t1.

To get p2 to l2_4: it starts in l2_3. So drive t2 (which starts in l2_4) to l2_3, load p2, drive back to l2_4, unload. That's steps 1-4.

To get p1 into t1: p1 starts in l2_2. Use t2 to transport p1 to l2_1, load into a2, fly to l1_1, unload, load into t1 (after driving t1 to l1_1).

So steps 1-13 as before.

Then, move p1 back to c2:

14. Unload p1 from t1 in l1_1, load into a1, fly to l2_1, unload, load into t2, drive to l2_5. Steps 14-20.

For p2: after step4, p2 is in l2_4. Use t2 to pick up p2, drive to l2_1, load into a2, fly to l1_1, unload, load into t1, drive to l1_5.

So total steps:

1. Drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2
2. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
3. Drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
4. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
5. Drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2
6. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
7. Drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
8. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
9. Loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
10. Flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
11. Unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
12. Drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
13. Loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
14. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
15. Loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
16. Flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
17. Unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
18. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
19. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
20. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
21. Drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2
22. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
23. Drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
24. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
25. Loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
26. Flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
27. Unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
28. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
29. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
30. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

But this plan has 30 steps. Is there a way to make it shorter?

Let's see. For example, after step4, p2 is in l2_4. Then, steps5-13 are about moving p1. Then steps14-20 move p1 to its goal.

For p2, after step4, we need to move it to l1_5. So steps21-30:

21. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2 (but t2 is at l2_1 after step7). So after step7, t2 is at l2_1. To pick up p2 from l2_4, t2 needs to drive back to l2_4. That's step21. Then load p2, drive to l2_1, load into a2, fly to l1_1, etc.

Alternatively, can we combine the movement of p2 into the same trip as p1? For example, after p1 is in l2_5, can t2 go back to l2_4, load p2, and proceed. But that requires t2 to make multiple trips.

Alternatively, after step4, p2 is in l2_4. If we load p2 into t2 (which is at l2_4 after step4?), but after step3, t2 is at l2_4. So after step4 (unload p2), t2 is still at l2_4. Then step5 is drivetruck t2 from l2_4 to l2_2. So t2 leaves l2_4. So after step5, t2 is at l2_2. So p2 is at l2_4. To move p2, we need to drive t2 back to l2_4.

But this is time-consuming. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Wait, perhaps after step4 (p2 is in l2_4), instead of moving t2 to l2_2 to pick up p1, we can use another truck. But the only trucks in c2 are t2. So no, we have to use t2.

Hmm. So I think the plan I outlined is the minimal steps required. But perhaps there's a way to optimize.

Another idea: After step4, p2 is in l2_4. Then, steps5-20 handle p1. Then steps21-30 handle p2. But maybe we can interleave some steps.

For example, after step13 (p1 loaded into t1 in l1_1), we can immediately start moving p2.

But p2 is in l2_4. To move p2 to l1_5, we need:

- Load p2 into t2 (but t2 is at l2_1 after step7). So steps:

14. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
15. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
16. Drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
17. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
18. Loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
19. Flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
20. Unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
21. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (t1 is at l1_1 from step12)
22. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
23. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

Meanwhile, steps for p1 after step13:

14. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
15. Loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
16. Flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
17. Unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
18. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (but t2 is at l2_4 in step14-16, then back to l2_1 in step16. So after step16, t2 is at l2_1. But step18 would be after step17. So yes, t2 is at l2_1 after step16. So step18: load p1 into t2, drive to l2_5.

So combining both:

Plan steps:

1. Drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2
2. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
3. Drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
4. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
5. Drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2
6. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
7. Drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
8. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
9. Loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
10. Flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
11. Unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
12. Drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
13. Loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
   [Constraint met here]
14. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
15. Loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
16. Flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
17. Unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
18. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2 (moving t2 to pick up p2)
19. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
20. Drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
21. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
22. Loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
23. Flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
24. Unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
25. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
26. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
27. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
28. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
29. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
30. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

But this is still 30 steps. Maybe there's a way to combine steps 18-20 and 28-30.

Alternatively, after step17, p1 is in l2_1. To get to l2_5, load into t2 and drive:

18. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
19. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
20. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

But steps 18-20 can be done after step17. Then, steps for p2:

21. Drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2 (assuming t2 is at l2_5 after step20)
22. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
23. Drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
24. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
25. Loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
26. Flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
27. Unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
28. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
29. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
30. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

So total steps:

1-13 as before
14. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
15. Loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
16. Flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
17. Unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
18. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
19. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
20. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
21. Drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2
22. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
23. Drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
24. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
25. Loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
26. Flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
27. Unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
28. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
29. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
30. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

This reduces the steps by a few, but it's still lengthy. But is there a way to reduce more?

Let me think about the airplane usage. Maybe after step10, a2 is at l1_1. Then, after step23, when we need to fly p2 to l1_1, a2 is already there. Wait, step10 is fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1. So after step10, a2 is at l1_1. Then, step26 is fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1 again, which requires a2 to be back at l2_1. But after step10, a2 is at l1_1. So to fly again, we need to fly it back to l2_1 first. Which would require an additional step:

After step10: a2 is at l1_1.

Then, before step25 (loading p2 into a2), we need to fly a2 back to l2_1. But that's not possible because in step25, we're loading p2 into a2 at l2_1. So a2 must be there. Therefore, after step10, a2 is at l1_1. To use it again to carry p2, we need to fly it back to l2_1. So steps:

After step10:

11. Unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
12. Flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1 (empty)
Then, later steps can use a2 again.

But this adds steps. For example:

After step10:

10. Flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
11. Unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
12. Flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1 (empty)
Then, step25: load p2 into a2 at l2_1.

But this adds steps 12 and 25, making the plan even longer. So perhaps using a different airplane for p2's transport would help. But the available airplanes are a1 and a2. a1 starts at l1_1 and a2 at l2_1. After step10, a2 is at l1_1. So for p2's flight, we can use a1. Let's see:

After step27: p2 is loaded into a1 and flown to l1_1. But a1 is already at l1_1. Wait, no, a1 starts at l1_1. So for p2's transport from l2_1 to l1_1, we can use a1:

Wait, no, because a1 is at l1_1. To carry p2 from l2_1 to l1_1, a1 would need to be in l2_1. So steps:

25. Flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (empty)
26. Loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
27. Flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
28. Unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

But this requires flying a1 empty to l2_1, which adds steps. So it's not better.

Thus, perhaps the initial plan is the best possible, albeit long. But maybe there's a shorter way.

Another observation: The constraint requires that p1 is in t1 and p2 is in l2_4 at some state. So after we load p1 into t1 (step13), and p2 is in l2_4 (step4), the constraint is satisfied. Then, any subsequent steps are to move p1 and p2 to their goals.

But perhaps after step13, we can immediately start moving p2, instead of moving p1 first.

For example:

After step13:

14. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2 (to pick up p2)
15. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
16. Drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
17. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
18. Loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
19. Flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
20. Unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
21. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
22. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
23. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

Meanwhile, after step13, p1 is in t1 at l1_1. To get p1 to l2_5:

24. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
25. Loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
26. Flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
27. Unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
28. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
29. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
30. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

This way, steps 14-23 handle p2, and steps24-30 handle p1. Total steps:30.

But the order doesn't matter; the total steps remain the same. 

Alternatively, after step13 (constraint met), handle p2's transport first, then p1's. But it's the same number of steps.

Is there a way to parallelize steps? For example, while p1 is being flown back to c2, can p2 be transported as well? But in the planning model, actions are sequential. So parallel actions aren't allowed.

Therefore, the minimal plan likely has 30 steps, but this seems excessively long. Maybe I'm missing a more efficient path.

Wait, maybe when moving p1 back to c2, we can use airplane a2 instead of a1. Let's see:

After step13, p1 is in t1 at l1_1. To move p1 to l2_5:

14. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
15. Loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (but a2 is at l1_1 after step10)
16. Flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
17. Unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
18. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
19. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
20. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

This saves steps compared to using a1. Because a2 is already at l1_1 after step10. So steps15-20:

15. Loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
16. Flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
17. Unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
18. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
19. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
20. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

This way, steps15-20 are 6 steps instead of 7 in the previous approach. So overall steps:

1. Drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2
2. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
3. Drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
4. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
5. Drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2
6. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
7. Drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
8. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
9. Loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
10. Flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
11. Unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
12. Drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
13. Loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
14. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
15. Loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
16. Flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
17. Unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
18. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
19. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
20. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
21. Drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2
22. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
23. Drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
24. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
25. Loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
26. Flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
27. Unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
28. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
29. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
30. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

This reduces the total steps by 2 (from 30 to 28) by reusing a2 for p1's return trip.

But wait, after step10, a2 is at l1_1. Then step15 loads p1 into a2 there, and step16 flies it back to l2_1. So steps15-16 are possible. This way, we avoid using a1 for p1's return, saving steps.

Yes, this seems better. So steps14-20 become steps14-20 in the new plan, which is fewer.

Another optimization: After step23, t2 is at l2_1. So for p2's transport:

21. Drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2 (but step19 leaves t2 at l2_5. So after step19, t2 is at l2_5. To get p2 from l2_4, t2 needs to drive back to l2_4 (step21), load p2 (step22), drive to l2_1 (step23). So steps21-23.

But after step20, t2 is at l2_5. So steps:

21. Drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2
22. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
23. Drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
24. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
25. Loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
26. Flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
27. Unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
28. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
29. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
30. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

So total steps: 30 steps again. But using a2 for both p1 and p2's flights.

Wait, step25: load p2 into a2 at l2_1. But after step16, a2 was flown to l2_1 (step16: fly a2 l1_1 l2_1). So a2 is at l2_1 when we need to load p2 into it. So yes.

So the final plan would be:

```
```
Drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2
Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
Drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
Drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2
Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
Drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
Loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
Flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
Unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
Drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
Loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
Loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
Flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
Unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
Drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2
Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
Drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
Loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
Flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
Unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
```
```

But let's count the steps:

1. Drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2
2. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
3. Drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
4. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
5. Drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2
6. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
7. Drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
8. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
9. Loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
10. Flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
11. Unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
12. Drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
13. Loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
14. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
15. Loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
16. Flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
17. Unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
18. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
19. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
20. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
21. Drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2
22. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
23. Drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
24. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
25. Loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
26. Flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
27. Unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
28. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
29. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
30. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

This is 30 steps. But perhaps there's a way to shorten it. For example, after step19 (p1 delivered), can we use t2 to pick up p2 without returning to l2_4?

Wait, p2 is at l2_4. So steps21-23 are required. No way around it.

Alternatively, after step20, t2 is at l2_5. To get p2, which is at l2_4, t2 needs to drive back to l2_4. So steps21-23 are necessary.

I think this is as optimal as possible. However, I wonder if there's a way to combine steps for p1 and p2 earlier. For example, using a single airplane trip for both packages. But since they need to go to different cities, it's not possible.

Alternatively, when flying p1 back to c2, maybe p2 can be on the same flight. But p2 needs to go to c1. So no.

In conclusion, the minimal plan requires 30 steps. But I might have missed a smarter way. Another idea: perhaps after step4, when p2 is in l2_4, we can load it into t2 again and drive to l2_1, but that would interfere with moving p1. But maybe not.

Alternatively, after step4 (p2 in l2_4), instead of moving t2 to l2_2 for p1, use another truck. But there's only t2 in c2. So no.

I think the plan I've outlined is correct, albeit lengthy. The constraint is met at step13 (after loading p1 into t1), and p2 is in l2_4 from step4. The rest of the steps are necessary to move both packages to their goals.
