I need to analyze the problem and create a valid plan that satisfies all the constraints. Let's break down the scenario:

**Initial state:**
- Location l1_1 is in city c1 (airport)
- Location l1_2 is in city c1
- Location l1_3 is in city c1
- Location l1_4 is in city c1
- Location l1_5 is in city c1
- Location l2_1 is in city c2 (airport)
- Location l2_2 is in city c2
- Location l2_3 is in city c2
- Location l2_4 is in city c2
- Location l2_5 is in city c2
- Truck t1 is in location l1_5
- Truck t2 is in location l2_1
- Package p1 is in location l1_3
- Package p2 is in location l1_5
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

Wait, I think there might be an issue with the initial state description. It says "Package t1 is in location l1_5" and "Package t2 is in location l2_1", but t1 and t2 are trucks, not packages. Similarly, it mentions "Package a1" and "Package a2", but these are airplanes. Let me re-interpret the initial state correctly:

**Initial state (corrected):**
- Location l1_1 is in city c1 (airport)
- Location l1_2 is in city c1
- Location l1_3 is in city c1
- Location l1_4 is in city c1
- Location l1_5 is in city c1
- Location l2_1 is in city c2 (airport)
- Location l2_2 is in city c2
- Location l2_3 is in city c2
- Location l2_4 is in city c2
- Location l2_5 is in city c2
- Truck t1 is in location l1_5
- Truck t2 is in location l2_1
- Package p1 is in location l1_3
- Package p2 is in location l1_5
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

**Goal state:**
- Package p1 is in location l1_4
- Package p2 is in location l1_2

**Constraints:**
1. Package p1 must be in location l1_3 in at least one state. (This is already true in the initial state)
2. If p1 is in location l1_3, it must at some point be in location l2_2 (either immediately or later).

Let's plan our solution:

For package p1:
- It starts at l1_3 (constraint 1 is already satisfied)
- According to constraint 2, it must visit l2_2 (which is in city c2) before reaching its final destination l1_4
- This means p1 needs to be:
  - Picked up by a truck in l1_3
  - Transported to the airport l1_1
  - Loaded onto an airplane
  - Flown to airport l2_1
  - Unloaded from the airplane
  - Picked up by a truck
  - Driven to l2_2 (to satisfy constraint 2)
  - Then driven back to airport l2_1
  - Loaded onto an airplane
  - Flown back to airport l1_1
  - Unloaded
  - Picked up by a truck
  - Finally driven to l1_4

For package p2:
- It starts at l1_5
- It needs to reach l1_2
- This can be done by truck within city c1:
  - Pick up p2 with a truck at l1_5
  - Drive to l1_2
  - Unload p2

Now, let me develop the detailed plan using the available actions:

1. First, I need to get truck t1 from l1_5 to l1_3 to pick up p1:
   - drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1

2. Load p1 into t1:
   - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3

3. Drive t1 to l1_1 (the airport in city c1):
   - drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1

4. Unload p1 at the airport:
   - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

5. Load p1 into airplane a1:
   - loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

6. Fly a1 to airport l2_1:
   - flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

7. Unload p1 from a1:
   - unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

8. Drive truck t2 from airport l2_1 to pick up p1:
   - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

9. Drive t2 to l2_2 (to satisfy constraint 2):
   - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2

10. Unload p1 at l2_2:
    - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

11. Load p1 back into t2:
    - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

12. Drive t2 back to airport l2_1:
    - drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2

13. Unload p1 at the airport:
    - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

14. Load p1 into a1 to fly back:
    - loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

15. Fly a1 back to airport l1_1:
    - flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1

16. Unload p1 from a1:
    - unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

17. Meanwhile, we can handle p2. First, load p2 into t1:
    - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1

18. Load p2 into t1:
    - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

19. Drive t1 to l1_2:
    - drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_2 c1

20. Unload p2 at l1_2:
    - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

21. Now, drive t1 to the airport to pick up p1:
    - drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1

22. Load p1 into t1:
    - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

23. Drive t1 to l1_4:
    - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

24. Unload p1 at l1_4:
    - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

Now, let me check if this plan satisfies all constraints and brings about the goal state:
- p1 moves from l1_3 -> (by truck) -> l1_1 -> (by airplane) -> l2_1 -> (by truck) -> l2_2 -> (by truck) -> l2_1 -> (by airplane) -> l1_1 -> (by truck) -> l1_4
- p2 moves from l1_5 -> (by truck) -> l1_2

Looking at the constraints:
1. "Package p1 is in location l1_3" - This is true in the initial state.
2. "If p1 is in location l1_3, it must visit l2_2" - Our plan takes p1 to l2_2 after it's in l1_3, so this constraint is satisfied.

The goal state:
- "Package p1 is in location l1_4" - Our plan ends with p1 in l1_4.
- "Package p2 is in location l1_2" - Our plan ends with p2 in l1_2.

Let me redo this properly to reduce confusion:

Initial state:
- Package p1 is in location l1_3
- Package p2 is in location l1_5
- Truck t1 is in location l1_5
- Truck t2 is in location l2_1
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

Oops, I think I misinterpreted some actions. Let me correct my understanding:

1. Wait, "unloadairplane" is specified twice:
   - "loadairplane p ap l" (should be "unloadairplane p ap l"): Unload package p from airplane ap in location l.

Let me replan with the correct interpretation:

1. First, I need to get truck t1 from l1_5 to l1_3 to pick up p1:
   - drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1

2. Load p1 into t1:
   - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3

3. Drive t1 to l1_1 (the airport in city c1):
   - drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1

4. Unload p1 at the airport:
   - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

5. Load p1 into airplane a1:
   - loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

6. Fly a1 to airport l2_1:
   - flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

7. Unload p1 from a1:
   - unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

8. Load p1 into truck t2:
   - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

9. Drive t2 to l2_2 (to satisfy constraint 2):
   - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2

10. Unload p1 at l2_2:
    - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

11. Load p1 back into t2:
    - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

12. Drive t2 back to airport l2_1:
    - drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2

13. Unload p1 at the airport:
    - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

14. Load p1 into a1 to fly back:
    - loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

15. Fly a1 back to airport l1_1:
    - flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1

16. Unload p1 from a1:
    - unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

17. Drive t1 back to l1_5 to pick up p2:
    - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1

18. Load p2 into t1:
    - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

19. Drive t1 to l1_2:
    - drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_2 c1

20. Unload p2 at l1_2:
    - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

21. Drive t1 to the airport to pick up p1:
    - drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1

22. Load p1 into t1:
    - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

23. Drive t1 to l1_4:
    - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

24. Unload p1 at l1_4:
    - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

Actually, we're asked for an optimal plan, so let me think about how to optimize this. We might not need to use the airplane for p1, or we could potentially optimize the truck movements.

Let's revise and try to find a more optimal solution:

Wait, I need to re-read the constraints. Constraint 2 states that if p1 is in location l1_3, then it must be moved to l2_2 at some point. Since p1 is already in l1_3 in the initial state, it MUST visit l2_2. So we have to transport it across cities.

Let me think of a more efficient plan:

1. We know p1 must go from l1_3 to l2_2 and then to l1_4.
2. For p2, it just needs to move from l1_5 to l1_2 within city c1.

Let's try to optimize:

For p1:
- Truck t1 picks up p1 from l1_3 and takes it to airport l1_1
- Airplane a1 flies p1 from l1_1 to l2_1
- Truck t2 takes p1 from l2_1 to l2_2 (satisfying constraint 2)
- Truck t2 returns p1 to l2_1
- Airplane a1 flies p1 back to l1_1
- Truck t1 takes p1 from l1_1 to l1_4

For p2:
- After delivering p1 to the airport, truck t1 can go pick up p2 from l1_5
- Truck t1 takes p2 to l1_2
- Then truck t1 can proceed to the airport to pick up p1 when it returns

Let me detail this plan step by step:

1. First, get truck t1 from l1_5 to l1_3 to pick up p1:
   `drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1`

2. Load p1 into t1:
   `loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3`

3. Drive t1 to l1_1 (the airport in city c1):
   `drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1`

4. Unload p1 at the airport:
   `unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1`

5. Now, t1 goes to pick up p2 while p1 is being transferred across cities:
   `drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1`

6. Load p2 into t1:
   `loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5`

7. Drive t1 to l1_2:
   `drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_2 c1`

8. Unload p2 at l1_2:
   `unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2`

9. Meanwhile, load p1 into airplane a1:
   `loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1`

10. Fly a1 to airport l2_1:
    `flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1`

11. Unload p1 from a1:
    `unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1`

12. Load p1 into truck t2:
    `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1`

13. Drive t2 to l2_2 (to satisfy constraint 2):
    `drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2`

14. Unload p1 at l2_2:
    `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2`

15. Load p1 back into t2:
    `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2`

16. Drive t2 back to airport l2_1:
    `drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2`

17. Unload p1 at the airport:
    `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1`

18. Load p1 into a1 to fly back:
    `loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1`

19. Fly a1 back to airport l1_1:
    `flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1`

20. Unload p1 from a1:
    `unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1`

21. Drive truck t1 from l1_2 to the airport to pick up p1:
    `drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1`

22. Load p1 into t1:
    `loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1`

23. Drive t1 to l1_4:
    `drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1`

24. Unload p1 at l1_4:
    `unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4`

This plan totals 24 steps. Let me see if we can optimize it further:

One potential optimization is that truck t1 doesn't necessarily need to go back to the airport after delivering p2. If we have a direct route from l1_2 to l1_4, it could wait for airplane a1 to arrive at a different location or meet it at the airport.

Wait, I think we have a more optimal plan:

1. Since p1 starts at l1_3 and is already at the location mentioned in constraint 1, we just need to ensure it visits l2_2.
2. Let truck t1 pick it up from l1_3, take it to the airport, where it will be flown to city c2.
3. Truck t2 will take p1 to l2_2 to satisfy constraint 2, then return it to the airport.
4. Airplane a1 will fly p1 back to city c1.
5. Meanwhile, another truck or the same truck can handle p2's journey from l1_5 to l1_2.

Let's see if we can further optimize the handling of p2:

In our earlier plan, we had truck t1 go:
l1_5 -> l1_3 -> l1_1 -> l1_5 -> l1_2 -> l1_1 -> l1_4

What if we did:
1. Truck t1 starts at l1_5, goes to pick up p2, then drops it off at l1_2.
2. Truck t1 then continues to pick up p1 at l1_3, takes it to airport l1_1, and later (after p1's round trip to city c2) picks it up from the airport and drops it at l1_4.

Let's write out this optimized plan:

1. Load p2 into truck t1 at its starting location l1_5:
   `loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5`

2. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_2 to drop off p2:
   `drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_2 c1`

3. Unload p2 at l1_2:
   `unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2`

4. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_3 to pick up p1:
   `drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1`

5. Load p1 into t1:
   `loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3`

6. Drive t1 to l1_1 (the airport in city c1):
   `drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1`

7. Unload p1 at the airport:
   `unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1`

8. Load p1 into airplane a1:
   `loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1`

9. Fly a1 to airport l2_1:
   `flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1`

10. Unload p1 from a1:
    `unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1`

11. Load p1 into truck t2:
    `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1`

12. Drive t2 to l2_2 (to satisfy constraint 2):
    `drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2`

13. Unload p1 at l2_2:
    `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2`

14. Load p1 back into t2:
    `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2`

15. Drive t2 back to airport l2_1:
    `drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2`

16. Unload p1 at the airport:
    `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1`

17. Load p1 into a1 to fly back:
    `loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1`

18. Fly a1 back to airport l1_1:
    `flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1`

19. Unload p1 from a1:
    `unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1`

20. Load p1 into t1:
    `loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1`

21. Drive t1 to l1_4:
    `drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1`

22. Unload p1 at l1_4:
    `unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4`

This plan totals 22 steps, which is a slight improvement over our previous plan of 24 steps. 

Actually, I realize I may be over-complicating this. Let's think about the essential actions required:

For p1:
- It starts at l1_3.
- It must visit l2_2.
- It must end at l1_4.

For p2:
- It starts at l1_5.
- It must end at l1_2.

Let's construct a direct plan:

For p1:
1. Truck t1 picks up p1 from l1_3.
2. Truck t1 takes p1 to airport l1_1.
3. Airplane a1 flies p1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
4. Truck t2 takes p1 from l2_1 to l2_2 (to satisfy constraint 2).
5. Truck t2 returns p1 to l2_1.
6. Airplane a1 flies p1 back to l1_1.
7. Truck t1 takes p1 from l1_1 to l1_4.

For p2:
1. Truck t1 picks up p2 from l1_5.
2. Truck t1 takes p2 to l1_2.

To optimize, let's interleave these actions in a sensible way:

1. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_3 to pick up p1:
   `drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1`

2. Load p1 into t1:
   `loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3`

3. Drive t1 to l1_1 (the airport):
   `drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1`

4. Unload p1 at the airport:
   `unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1`

5. Load p1 into a1:
   `loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1`

6. Drive t1 back to l1_5 to pick up p2:
   `drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1`

7. Load p2 into t1:
   `loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5`

8. Drive t1 to l1_2:
   `drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_2 c1`

9. Unload p2 at l1_2:
   `unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2`

10. Meanwhile, fly a1 to l2_1:
    `flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1`

11. Unload p1 from a1:
    `unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1`

12. Load p1 into t2:
    `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1`

13. Drive t2 to l2_2:
    `drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2`

14. Unload p1 at l2_2:
    `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2`

15. Load p1 back into t2:
    `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2`

16. Drive t2 back to l2_1:
    `drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2`

17. Unload p1 at l2_1:
    `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1`

18. Load p1 into a1:
    `loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1`

19. Fly a1 back to l1_1:
    `flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1`

20. Unload p1 from a1:
    `unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1`

21. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1:
    `drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1`

22. Load p1 into t1:
    `loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1`

23. Drive t1 to l1_4:
    `drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1`

24. Unload p1 at l1_4:
    `unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4`

This plan is 24 steps.

Actually, there's one more optimization I can think of. Instead of having truck t1 go back to l1_5 to pick up p2, we could have had it drop p1 at the airport, then immediately go pick up p2, and deliver it to l1_2. Then, t1 would wait at l1_2 until p1 is back at the airport, and then go pick up p1.

Let's replan:

1. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_3 to pick up p1:
   `drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1`

2. Load p1 into t1:
   `loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3`

3. Drive t1 to l1_1 (the airport):
   `drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1`

4. Unload p1 at the airport:
   `unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1`

5. Load p1 into a1:
   `loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1`

6. Fly a1 to l2_1:
   `flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1`

7. Unload p1 from a1:
   `unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1`

8. Load p1 into t2:
   `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1`

9. Drive t2 to l2_2:
   `drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2`

10. Unload p1 at l2_2:
    `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2`

11. Load p1 back into t2:
    `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2`

12. Drive t2 back to l2_1:
    `drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2`

13. Unload p1 at l2_1:
    `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1`

14. Load p1 into a1:
    `loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1`

15. Fly a1 back to l1_1:
    `flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1`

16. Unload p1 from a1:
    `unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1`

17. Meanwhile, drive t1 to l1_5:
    `drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1`

18. Load p2 into t1:
    `loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5`

19. Drive t1 to l1_2:
    `drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_2 c1`

20. Unload p2 at l1_2:
    `unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2`

21. Drive t1 to l1_1:
    `drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1`

22. Load p1 into t1:
    `loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1`

23. Drive t1 to l1_4:
    `drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1`

24. Unload p1 at l1_4:
    `unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4`

However, I realize that this plan also has 24 steps. 

Let me approach this differently:
- We know we need to transport p1 from l1_3 to l1_4, with a detour to l2_2.
- We need to transport p2 from l1_5 to l1_2.

Let's focus on the minimum number of actions needed for both:

For p1:
1. Load p1 into t1 at l1_3.
2. Drive t1 to l1_1.
3. Unload p1 at l1_1.
4. Load p1 into a1.
5. Fly a1 to l2_1.
6. Unload p1 at l2_1.
7. Load p1 into t2.
8. Drive t2 to l2_2.
9. Unload p1 at l2_2.
10. Load p1 into t2.
11. Drive t2 back to l2_1.
12. Unload p1 at l2_1.
13. Load p1 into a1.
14. Fly a1 back to l1_1.
15. Unload p1 at l1_1.
16. Load p1 into t1.
17. Drive t1 to l1_4.
18. Unload p1 at l1_4.

That's 18 steps for p1.

For p2:
1. Load p2 into t1 at l1_5.
2. Drive t1 to l1_2.
3. Unload p2 at l1_2.

That's 3 steps for p2.

Ideally, we'd like to interleave these actions for maximum efficiency. One issue is that t1 is busy with p1 for some time, which means that p2 might have to wait a bit.

However, there's a simpler approach. Since p2 is in l1_5 and t1 is also in l1_5 at the beginning, we can have t1 deliver p2 to l1_2 first, and then go to l1_3 to pick up p1. This way, p2 is delivered before we even start the journey with p1.

Let's replan:

1. Load p2 into t1 at l1_5:
   `loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5`

2. Drive t1 to l1_2:
   `drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_2 c1`

3. Unload p2 at l1_2:
   `unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2`

4. Drive t1 to l1_3:
   `drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1`

5. Load p1 into t1:
   `loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3`

6. Drive t1 to l1_1:
   `drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1`

7. Unload p1 at l1_1:
   `unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1`

8. Load p1 into a1:
   `loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1`

9. Fly a1 to l2_1:
   `flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1`

10. Unload p1 from a1:
    `unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1`

11. Load p1 into t2:

    `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2`

15. Drive t2 back to l2_1:
    `drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2`

16. Unload p1 at l2_1:
    `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1`

17. Load p1 into a1:
    `loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1`

18. Fly a1 back to l1_1:
    `flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1`

19. Unload p1 from a1:

    `loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1`

21. Drive t1 to l1_4:
    `drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1`

22. Unload p1 at l1_4:
    `unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4`

This plan is 22 steps. I don't think we can do better than this.

Let me check if I'm missing anything:

1. Load p2 into t1 at l1_5: `loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5`
2. Drive t1 to l1_2: `drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_2 c1`
3. Unload p2 at l1_2: `unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2`
4. Drive t1 to l1_3: `drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1`
5. Load p1 into t1: `loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3`
6. Drive t1 to l1_1: `drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1`
7. Unload p1 at l1_1: `unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1`
8. Load p1 into a1: `loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1`
9. Fly a1 to l2_1: `flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1`
10. Unload p1 from a1: `unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1`
11. Load p1 into t2: `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1`
12. Drive t2 to l2_2: `drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2`
13. Unload p1 at l2_2: `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2`
14. Load p1 into t2: `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2`
15. Drive t2 back to l2_1: `drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2`
16. Unload p1 at l2_1: `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1`
17. Load p1 into a1: `loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1`
18. Fly a1 back to l1_1: `flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1`
19. Unload p1 from a1: `unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1`
20. Load p1 into t1: `loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1`
21. Drive t1 to l1_4: `drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1`
22. Unload p1 at l1_4: `unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4`

Alright, I believe this is the optimal plan. It meets all the constraints and achieves the goal state, and I don't believe we can reduce the number of steps further.

Well actually, I think we might be able to use a2 (which is already at l2_1) to transport p1 back to l1_1, instead of using a1 for the return journey. Let's explore this possibility:

1. Load p2 into t1 at l1_5: `loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5`
2. Drive t1 to l1_2: `drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_2 c1`
3. Unload p2 at l1_2: `unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2`
4. Drive t1 to l1_3: `drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1`
5. Load p1 into t1: `loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3`
6. Drive t1 to l1_1: `drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1`
7. Unload p1 at l1_1: `unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1`
8. Load p1 into a1: `loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1`
9. Fly a1 to l2_1: `flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1`
10. Unload p1 from a1: `unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1`
11. Load p1 into t2: `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1`
12. Drive t2 to l2_2: `drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2`
13. Unload p1 at l2_2: `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2`
14. Load p1 into t2: `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2`
15. Drive t2 back to l2_1: `drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2`
16. Unload p1 at l2_1: `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1`
17. Load p1 into a2: `loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1`
18. Fly a2 to l1_1: `flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1`
19. Unload p1 from a2: `unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1`
20. Load p1 into t1: `loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1`
21. Drive t1 to l1_4: `drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1`
22. Unload p1 at l1_4: `unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4`

This plan also has 22 steps, the same as our previous one. Since we don't have any other vehicles or options to explore, I believe this is the optimal solution.

Actually, wait, I realized there's another improvement we can make. We can save a couple of steps by having the packages be transported in parallel by different trucks and airplanes. Let's see:

1. Drive t1 to l1_3: `drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1`
2. Load p1 into t1: `loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3`
3. Drive t1 to l1_1: `drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1`
4. Unload p1 at l1_1: `unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1`
5. Load p1 into a1: `loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1`
6. Fly a1 to l2_1: `flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1`
7. Unload p1 from a1: `unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1`
8. Load p1 into t2: `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1`
9. Drive t2 to l2_2: `drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2`
10. Unload p1 at l2_2: `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2`
11. Load p1 into t2: `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2`
12. Drive t2 back to l2_1: `drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2`
13. Unload p1 at l2_1: `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1`
14. Load p1 into a2: `loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1`
15. Fly a2 to l1_1: `flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1`
16. Unload p1 from a2: `unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1`
17. Drive t1 back to l1_5: `drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1`
18. Load p2 into t1: `loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5`
19. Drive t1 to l1_2: `drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_2 c1`
20. Unload p2 at l1_2: `unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2`
21. Drive t1 to l1_1: `drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1`
22. Load p1 into t1: `loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1`
23. Drive t1 to l1_4: `drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1`
24. Unload p1 at l1_4: `unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4`

This plan has 24 steps. 

Actually, I think we need to step back and realize that in our previous plan, we had truck t1 deliver p2 to l1_2 first, then pick up p1. This is actually more efficient than having t1 immediately pick up p1, because it allows us to complete one part of the goal (delivering p2 to l1_2) before potentially running into complications with the other part.

Let's stick with that plan and avoid unnecessary steps:

1. Load p2 into t1 at l1_5: `loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5`
2. Drive t1 to l1_2: `drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_2 c1`
3. Unload p2 at l1_2: `unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2`
4. Drive t1 to l1_3: `drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1`
5. Load p1 into t1: `loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3`
6. Drive t1 to l1_1: `drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1`
7. Unload p1 at l1_1: `unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1`
8. Load p1 into a1: `loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1`
9. Fly a1 to l2_1: `flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1`
10. Unload p1 from a1: `unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1`
11. Load p1 into t2: `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1`
12. Drive t2 to l2_2: `drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2`
13. Unload p1 at l2_2: `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2`
14. Load p1 into t2: `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2`
15. Drive t2 back to l2_1: `drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2`
16. Unload p1 at l2_1: `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1`
17. Load p1 into a1: `loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1`
18. Fly a1 back to l1_1: `flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1`
19. Unload p1 from a1: `unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1`
20. Load p1 into t1: `loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1`
21. Drive t1 to l1_4: `drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1`
22. Unload p1 at l1_4: `unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4`

This plan is 22 steps. Let's look at the entire plan and see if it covers everything:

1. The goal requires that p1 is in l1_4 and p2 is in l1_2.
2. The constraints are:
   a. p1 must be at l1_3 at least once (already satisfied in the initial state).
   b. If p1 is at l1_3, it must eventually be at l2_2.

In our plan:
- p1 starts at l1_3 and is taken to l1_4 via l2_2, satisfying the constraint.
- p2 is moved from l1_5 to l1_2, satisfying the goal.

I think our plan is valid and optimal, with 22 steps. It's definitely better than the 24-step plan I was considering earlier.

So here's the final optimal plan:

1. Load p2 into t1 at l1_5: `loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5`
2. Drive t1 to l1_2: `drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_2 c1`
3. Unload p2 at l1_2: `unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2`
4. Drive t1 to l1_3: `drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1`
5. Load p1 into t1: `loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3`
6. Drive t1 to l1_1: `drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1`
7. Unload p1 at l1_1: `unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1`
8. Load p1 into a1: `loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1`
9. Fly a1 to l2_1: `flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1`
10. Unload p1 from a1: `unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1`
11. Load p1 into t2: `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1`
12. Drive t2 to l2_2: `drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2`
13. Unload p1 at l2_2: `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2`
14. Load p1 into t2: `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2`
15. Drive t2 back to l2_1: `drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2`
16. Unload p1 at l2_1: `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1`
17. Load p1 into a1: `loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1`
18. Fly a1 back to l1_1: `flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1`
19. Unload p1 from a1: `unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1`
20. Load p1 into t1: `loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1`
21. Drive t1 to l1_4: `drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1`
22. Unload p1 at l1_4: `unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4`
