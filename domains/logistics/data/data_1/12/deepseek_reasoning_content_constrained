Okay, let's see. I need to find a plan to move package p1 to l1_4 and p2 to l1_2, following the given constraints. The constraints are a bit tricky. First, there's a requirement that at some state, p1 is in l1_3. And if that happens, then p1 must be in l2_2 either in that state or a later one. Hmm.

Let me start by understanding the initial state. So, p1 is at l1_3 initially. Wait, the original state says "Package p1 is in location l1_3". Oh, right. So the initial state already satisfies the first constraint that p1 is in l1_3 at some state (the initial state). But then the second constraint says that if p1 is in l1_3 at some state s, then in s or a later state, p1 must be in l2_2. So since the initial state has p1 in l1_3, we need to ensure that either in the initial state (which it isn't, because p1 starts at l1_3, not l2_2) or in some subsequent state, p1 is in l2_2. So the plan must include moving p1 to l2_2 at some point after the initial state.

But the final goal is to have p1 in l1_4. So after moving p1 to l2_2, we need to get it back to l1_4. Wait, that's complicated. Let's break it down.

First, let's handle p2. The goal is to have p2 in l1_2. Initially, p2 is in l1_5. So we need to move p2 from l1_5 to l1_2. Since both are in city c1, maybe using truck t1. But where is t1? The original state says "Package t1 is in location l1_5". Wait, wait—the objects include "truck t1" and "truck t2". The original state mentions "Package t1" but that's probably a typo. Wait, the original state says:

"Package t1 is in location l1_5"
"Package t2 is in location l2_1"
"Package p1 is in location l1_3"
"Package p2 is in location l1_5"
"Package a1 is in location l1_1"
"Package a2 is in location l2_1"

Wait, that can't be right. Trucks are vehicles, not packages. Oh, this must be a mistake in the problem statement. Probably, "truck t1 is in location l1_5" instead of "Package t1...". Because otherwise, we can't load packages into trucks if the trucks are packages. So assuming that's a typo, the initial positions are:

Truck t1 is at l1_5 (city c1).
Truck t2 is at l2_1 (city c2).
Airplane a1 is at l1_1 (airport in c1).
Airplane a2 is at l2_1 (airport in c2).
Package p1 is at l1_3 (c1).
Package p2 is at l1_5 (c1).

So for p2: it's at l1_5. Truck t1 is also at l1_5. So we can load p2 into t1, drive t1 to l1_2, then unload. That seems straightforward.

For p1: initial location is l1_3. Need to get to l1_4. But the constraints require that at some point, p1 is in l2_2. So the plan must involve moving p1 to l2_2 and then back to l1_4. How?

To get p1 from l1_3 to l2_2, which is in city c2. Since cities are connected via airplanes. So first, move p1 to an airport in c1 (l1_1), load it onto an airplane, fly to c2's airport (l2_1), unload, then use truck t2 (which is at l2_1) to drive to l2_2. Then unload p1 there. Then, to get it back to c1, perhaps fly it back using airplane a2 from l2_1 to l1_1, then use truck t1 to move to l1_4. Wait, but how?

Alternatively, after p1 is in l2_2, we need to get it back to c1. Let's see. The steps could be:

For p1:

1. Move p1 from l1_3 to l1_1 (using truck t1? But where is t1? Initially, t1 is at l1_5. So first, drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_3. Wait, l1_5 and l1_3 are both in c1, so drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1.

Then load p1 into t1 at l1_3. Then drive t1 to l1_1. Unload p1 at l1_1. Then load p1 into airplane a1 (which is at l1_1). Fly a1 to l2_1 (c2's airport). Unload p1 from a1. Now p1 is at l2_1. Then load p1 into truck t2 (which is at l2_1). Drive t2 to l2_2, unload p1. Now p1 is at l2_2. Then to get it back to c1: load it into t2 again, drive back to l2_1, load into airplane a2 (which is at l2_1). Fly a2 to l1_1. Unload p1. Then load into truck t1 (if t1 is at l1_1), drive to l1_4, unload.

But this seems a lot of steps. Let me check the constraints. The constraints require that after p1 is in l1_3 (which is the initial state), then at some point, p1 must be in l2_2. So moving p1 to l2_2 satisfies that. But we have to then get it back to l1_4. So the plan for p1 is more complex.

But let's first handle the p2 movement, as it's simpler. Since p2 is at l1_5 with t1. So steps for p2:

- loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
- drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_2 c1
- unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

That's three actions. So that's straightforward.

For p1:

Need to get it from l1_3 to l1_4, but with the detour to l2_2.

Possible steps:

1. Move t1 from l1_5 to l1_3 (drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1)
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
3. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1 (assuming l1_1 is an airport in c1)
Wait, is l1_1 in c1? Yes, according to original state. So drive to l1_1.
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (now p1 is at l1_1)
5. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (since a1 is at l1_1)
6. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (to c2's airport)
7. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 (now p1 is at l2_1)
8. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (truck t2 is at l2_1)
9. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
10. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (now p1 is in l2_2, satisfying the constraint that after being in l1_3, it's in l2_2)
Then need to get p1 back to l1_4.

Now to move p1 back from l2_2 to l1_4:

11. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 (drive back to airport)
12. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (now p1 is at l2_1)
13. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (a2 is at l2_1)
14. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (back to c1's airport)
15. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (p1 is at l1_1)
16. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (assuming t1 is now at l1_1? Wait, where is t1 after step 3?

Wait, in step 3, after driving t1 from l1_3 to l1_1, t1 is at l1_1. Then step 4 unloads p1 there. So t1 is still at l1_1. Then, after that, when we move a1 to l2_1 (step 6), t1 remains at l1_1.

So in step 16, we can load p1 into t1 again at l1_1, then drive to l1_4:

16. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
17. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
18. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

That would complete the plan for p1.

So the total steps for p1 are 18-3 (since p2's steps are 3) but wait, need to interleave the steps? Because actions are sequential. Let's see:

Total plan steps would be:

For p2:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
2. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_2 c1
3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

For p1:

4. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1 (Wait, but after step 2, t1 is at l1_2. So this is a problem. Because after step 2, t1 is at l1_2. So steps for p1 can't use t1 until after step 3.

Wait, this is a problem. Because after step 2, t1 is at l1_2. So step 3 is unloading p2 there. Then, to move p1, we need to use t1 again, but first, we need to drive it back to l1_3.

Wait, but the initial position of t1 is l1_5. So let's see the order:

Maybe first handle moving t1 to l1_3 to load p1, then move it to l1_1, but in between, need to handle p2.

Wait, perhaps the steps need to be interleaved. Let's think:

If we first move t1 from l1_5 to l1_3 (to get p1), load p1, then drive to l1_1, then unload. Then, use the same truck to handle p2.

But no, because after moving p1 to l1_1, t1 is there. But p2 is at l1_5. So maybe first handle p2, then p1. But after moving p2, t1 is at l1_2. So then, to get p1, we need to move t1 back to l1_3.

Wait, let's outline:

First, handle p2:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 (t1 is at l1_5)
2. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_2 c1 (t1 moves to l1_2)
3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (p2 is done)

Now, t1 is at l1_2. To get p1, which is at l1_3, we need to drive t1 back to l1_3. So:

4. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1 (t1 now at l1_3)
5. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (load p1 into t1)
6. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1 (drive to airport)
7. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (p1 at l1_1)
8. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (a1 is here)
9. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (fly to c2)
10. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 (p1 at l2_1)
11. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (t2 is here)
12. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
13. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (now p1 is in l2_2, satisfying the constraint)
14. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 (drive back to airport)
15. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (p1 at l2_1)
16. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (a2 is here)
17. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (fly back to c1)
18. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (p1 at l1_1)
19. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (t1 is here now)
20. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
21. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

But this is a lot of steps. But we need to check if this is the minimal possible. Also, maybe there's a shorter path.

Wait, perhaps after moving p1 to l2_2, instead of bringing it back via the same route, maybe use a different airplane. Wait, but a1 is in l2_1 after step 9. So maybe fly a1 back. Let's see:

Alternatively, after step 13 (p1 at l2_2), to get it back, perhaps:

14. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 (t2 back to airport)
15. loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 (if a1 is still at l2_1)
Wait, after step 9, a1 is at l2_1. So after step 10, a1 is still there. Then step 10 unloads p1, so a1 is at l2_1. So step 14, after unloading p1, a1 is at l2_1. So instead of using a2, perhaps use a1 again to fly back.

So step 14 could be:

14. loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
15. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
16. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

Then, steps 17-19 as before. That would save a couple of steps. Let me check.

Original steps after 13:

14. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 (step 14)
15. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (step15)
16. loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 (step16)
17. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1 (step17)
18. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (step18)
19. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (assuming t1 is here)
20. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
21. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

But how many steps is that? Let's count:

For p2: steps 1-3.

For p1:

4. drive t1 to l1_3
5. load p1 into t1
6. drive t1 to l1_1
7. unload p1
8. load into a1
9. fly a1 to l2_1
10. unload p1
11. load into t2
12. drive t2 to l2_2
13. unload p1 (now in l2_2)
14. drive t2 back to l2_1
15. unload p1 (but wait, after step13, p1 is already unloaded. So steps 14 and 15 are unnecessary. Wait, no. Wait, after step13, p1 is unloaded from t2 at l2_2, so t2 is at l2_2. To get p1 back, we need to load it again into t2, drive back to l2_1, then into airplane.

Wait, after step13: p1 is at l2_2. To move it back, we need to load it into t2 again. So:

14. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (but t2 is at l2_2)
15. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
16. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
17. loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 (a1 is there)
18. fly a1 to l1_1
19. unload p1
20. load into t1
21. drive to l1_4
22. unload

So steps 14-22. That's more steps. So perhaps the initial plan is longer, but necessary.

Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way. Let's think again.

Alternative approach: Since p1 starts in l1_3 (c1), need to get to l2_2 (c2), then back to l1_4 (c1). How?

But maybe using airplanes and trucks more efficiently.

Wait, after p1 is loaded into a1 and flown to l2_1, then loaded into t2 and driven to l2_2. Then, to get it back, perhaps use a different airplane. Wait, a2 is at l2_1 initially. So maybe after p1 is in l2_2, load into t2, drive back to l2_1, load into a2, fly to l1_1, then unload and load into t1.

But that's similar to the previous plan. I think the steps are necessary.

But let's check the constraints again. The constraint requires that if p1 is in l1_3 in some state, then p1 must be in l2_2 in that state or a later one. Since p1 starts in l1_3, the initial state is state s where p1 is in l1_3. So we need to have p1 in l2_2 in s (initial) or later. Since it's not in l2_2 initially, it must be in some later state. So our plan must include moving p1 to l2_2.

But after moving p1 to l2_2, how do we get it back to l1_4? Well, that's necessary for the goal.

So the steps for p1 are unavoidable. Thus, the plan will have:

For p2: load, drive, unload (3 steps).

For p1: a series of steps involving moving to airport, flying to c2, moving to l2_2, then returning.

But how to arrange the steps in order to minimize the total steps.

Another approach: perhaps interleave the steps for p1 and p2 to save some moves.

Wait, after handling p2 first, t1 is at l1_2. Then, driving t1 back to l1_3 to pick up p1.

Alternatively, maybe handle p1 first, then p2. Let's see:

1. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_3 (1)
2. Load p1 (2)
3. Drive to l1_1 (3)
4. Unload (4)
5. Load into a1 (5)
6. Fly to l2_1 (6)
7. Unload (7)
8. Load into t2 (8)
9. Drive to l2_2 (9)
10. Unload (10) → now p1 is in l2_2, satisfying the constraint.
11. Drive t2 back to l2_1 (11)
12. Load into a2 (12)
13. Fly to l1_1 (13)
14. Unload (14)
15. Load into t1 (15)
16. Drive to l1_4 (16)
17. Unload (17)
Then handle p2:
18. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_5 (18)
19. Load p2 (19)
20. Drive to l1_2 (20)
21. Unload (21)

But this results in 21 steps, which is longer. So handling p2 first is better.

Alternatively, perhaps while moving p1 to the airport, use the same truck for p2.

Wait, after moving t1 to l1_3 to load p1, then drive to l1_1, unload p1. Then t1 is at l1_1. Then, drive t1 back to l1_5 to load p2. But that would be:

For p1:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
3. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
5. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
6. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
7. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
8. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
9. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
10. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
11. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
12. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 → Wait, no, after step10, p1 is unloaded at l2_2. So steps 11 and 12 are not needed. Instead:

After step10, p1 is at l2_2. Then need to get it back to c1.

So:

11. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (assuming t2 is at l2_2 after step9)
But after step9, t2 is at l2_2. So step9 is drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2. Then step10 unload, so t2 is still at l2_2.

So step11: loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (load p1 into t2)
12. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 (drive back to airport)
13. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (now p1 is at l2_1)
14. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (a2 is there)
15. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
16. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
17. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (t1 is at l1_1 after step3)
18. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
19. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

Then, handle p2:

t1 is at l1_4 now. To get p2 from l1_5, need to drive t1 back to l1_5.

20. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1
21. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
22. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_2 c1
23. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

This plan is longer. So it's not better.

So the initial approach of handling p2 first and then p1 seems better.

Putting it all together:

Plan steps:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
2. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_2 c1
3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (p2 done)
4. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1 (move t1 to p1's location)
5. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
6. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1 (to airport)
7. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
8. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
9. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
10. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
11. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (using t2 in c2)
12. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
13. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (now p1 is in l2_2, satisfying constraint)
14. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 (return to airport)
15. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (p1 now at l2_1)
16. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (using a2)
17. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
18. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
19. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (t1 is at l1_1 after step6)
20. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
21. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4 (goal achieved)

That's 21 steps. But maybe there's a shorter way.

Wait, after step3, t1 is at l1_2. To get to l1_3, step4 is drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1. Then step5-7. After step7, t1 is at l1_1. Then steps8-9, etc.

But perhaps there's a way to optimize the return trip of p1. For example, after step13 (p1 at l2_2), instead of driving back to l2_1, maybe fly from l2_2. But airplanes can only fly between airports, and l2_2 is not an airport. So need to use truck to get back to airport.

Alternatively, after step13, p1 is at l2_2. To fly back, must move to l2_1 (airport). So steps14-15 are necessary.

Alternatively, could we use airplane a1 to fly back? a1 is at l2_1 after step9. So after step13, a1 is still at l2_1. So steps 14-17 could be:

14. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (but t2 is at l2_2)
15. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
16. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
17. loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
18. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
19. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
Then load into t1 and drive to l1_4.

This would save steps by using a1 again instead of a2. Because step17 uses a1 (which is at l2_1) to fly back.

So steps revised:

After step13:

14. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (if p1 is at l2_2 and t2 is there)
But wait, after step13, p1 is unloaded from t2 at l2_2. So t2 is at l2_2. So p1 is at l2_2, and t2 is there. So to load p1 into t2 again:

14. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
15. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
16. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
17. loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 (a1 is still here)
18. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
19. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
20. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
21. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
22. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

That's 22 steps. But earlier version was 21. Hmm.

Wait, the initial steps for p1 after handling p2:

4. drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_3 (step4)
5. load p1 (step5)
6. drive to l1_1 (step6)
7. unload (step7)
8. load into a1 (step8)
9. fly to l2_1 (step9)
10. unload (step10)
11. load into t2 (step11)
12. drive to l2_2 (step12)
13. unload (step13)
14. load into t2 (step14)
15. drive back to l2_1 (step15)
16. unload (step16)
17. load into a1 (step17)
18. fly back (step18)
19. unload (step19)
20. load into t1 (step20)
21. drive to l1_4 (step21)
22. unload (step22)

So 22 steps. But the earlier approach using a2 was 21 steps. Which is better?

Alternatively, after step13, p1 is at l2_2. a2 is at l2_1. So when we load p1 into t2 again, drive to l2_1, unload, then load into a2 and fly to l1_1. Then use t1 to drive to l1_4.

But using a2 would require steps:

14. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
15. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
16. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
17. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
18. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
19. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
20. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
21. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
22. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

Same number of steps. So whether using a1 or a2 doesn't change the step count.

But perhaps there's a smarter way. Let's think again: After step13, p1 is at l2_2. To get it back, we have to use t2 to drive to l2_1, then fly back. Is there a way to fly directly from l2_2? No, because airplanes can only fly between airports.

Alternative idea: Use a different airplane that's already at l2_1. But no, both a1 and a2 are at l2_1 after steps. So no difference.

Alternatively, after step13, is there a way to fly a different airplane from l2_2 to l1_1? No, because l2_2 is not an airport. So no.

Thus, the steps are unavoidable.

So the total plan would be:

For p2: steps 1-3.

For p1: steps4-22 (total 22 steps), but perhaps combining steps.

Wait, but maybe there's a way to avoid some steps. For example, after unloading p1 at l2_2 (step13), instead of driving back to l2_1, perhaps fly an airplane from l2_1 to l2_2. But airplanes can't fly to non-airport locations. So no.

Another idea: Can we use the same airplane for multiple flights?

For example, after step9, a1 is at l2_1. Then, after step18 (flying a1 back to l1_1), a1 is there. Then, for another flight.

But I don't see how that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps after step10, when p1 is unloaded at l2_1, instead of using truck t2 to move to l2_2, is there another way? No, because in city c2, only trucks can move between locations.

So the steps seem necessary.

Now, the plan length is 22 steps. But maybe there's a shorter way.

Wait, maybe after step13 (p1 at l2_2), instead of loading it back into t2 and driving to l2_1, can we use another airplane? But no, because airplanes are at airports.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to have p1 in l2_2 and then directly fly it back. But that's impossible without moving it to an airport.

So, the steps are unavoidable.

But the user requires an optimal plan, i.e., the shortest possible. So perhaps there's a shorter path.

Wait, perhaps after step13, instead of moving p1 back to c1, can we use another truck or airplane in c2? But the goal is to have p1 in l1_4, which is in c1. So p1 must be moved back.

Alternative approach: Maybe use the airplane a2 which is initially at l2_1. So after step13, p1 is at l2_2. To get it back:

14. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
15. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
16. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
17. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
18. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
19. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
20. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
21. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
22. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

That's 22 steps. Including the steps for p2 (1-3), total steps are 22. But how many steps are there in total?

Wait, the steps are:

For p2:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
2. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_2 c1
3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

For p1:

4. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1
5. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
6. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
7. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
8. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
9. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
10. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
11. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
12. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
13. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
14. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
15. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
16. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
17. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
18. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
19. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
20. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
21. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
22. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

So total of 22 steps. But maybe there's a way to combine steps or reuse trucks.

Wait, after step3, t1 is at l1_2. To get to l1_3, step4 is needed. Then step5-6.

After step6, t1 is at l1_1. Then after step20, t1 is loaded again.

But perhaps after step7, when p1 is unloaded at l1_1, t1 is there. Then after handling p1's return flight, t1 is still at l1_1. So steps 20-22 are possible.

But is there a way to avoid some steps?

Let me think differently. What if we use airplane a2 to carry p1 back?

After step13 (p1 at l2_2):

14. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
15. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
16. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
17. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
18. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
19. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
20. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
21. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
22. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

Same number of steps.

But perhaps there's a way to avoid the second load into t2. Wait, after step13, p1 is at l2_2. To get it to l2_1, we have to load it into t2 again. So steps14-16 are necessary.

Alternatively, maybe use a different truck. But the only trucks are t1 and t2. t1 is in c1 after step3. So no.

Hmm. I think the minimal plan is 22 steps, but perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another approach: Use airplane a1 to fly back. After step13, a1 is at l2_1 (since step9 flew it there). So after step13, to move p1 back:

14. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
15. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
16. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
17. loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
18. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
19. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
20. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
21. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
22. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

Same steps. So no difference.

Another thought: After step13, p1 is in l2_2. The constraint is satisfied. The goal is to have p1 in l1_4. So after step13, any way to get p1 to l1_4 without going through l2_1? No, because l2_2 is in c2, and to get to c1, you need to go through an airport.

Thus, no shortcut.

So the plan has to be 22 steps. But that seems long. Is there any way to optimize?

Wait, perhaps after step3 (p2 is done), t1 is at l1_2. Instead of driving t1 to l1_3, maybe use another truck. But there's no other truck in c1 except t1. So no.

Alternative idea: Use airplane to move p1 within c1. But airplanes can only fly between airports. So if we can move p1 to l1_1 via airplane and then use truck. Wait, but initially, p1 is at l1_3. So to get to l1_1 via truck, which is what we did.

Alternatively, but that's already part of the plan.

Hmm. I think the plan is correct, but maybe there's a shorter way.

Wait, let's count the steps again for p1:

- Move t1 to l1_3 (step4)
- Load p1 (step5)
- Drive to l1_1 (step6)
- Unload (step7)
- Load into a1 (step8)
- Fly to l2_1 (step9)
- Unload (step10)
- Load into t2 (step11)
- Drive to l2_2 (step12)
- Unload (step13)
- Load into t2 (step14)
- Drive back to l2_1 (step15)
- Unload (step16)
- Load into a2 (step17)
- Fly to l1_1 (step18)
- Unload (step19)
- Load into t1 (step20)
- Drive to l1_4 (step21)
- Unload (step22)

So steps for p1: 19 steps (from step4 to step22). Plus p2's 3 steps: total 22.

But the user wants the optimal plan, which is the shortest possible. Is there a way to reduce the number of steps?

Another idea: After step13, p1 is at l2_2. To get it back to c1, maybe use a different airplane that's already in c1. But no, airplanes are a1 and a2. a1 is in l2_1, a2 is in l2_1 initially but after step17, a2 is used to fly back.

Wait, initially, a2 is at l2_1. So when we fly a2 back to l1_1, then a2 is there. But that's after step18.

Alternatively, maybe use a2 to carry p1 back without using t2 to drive back to l2_1. But p1 is at l2_2, which is not an airport, so can't fly from there.

Hmm. I think the plan is correct, and it's the shortest possible given the constraints. Therefore, the answer is the sequence of steps outlined.
