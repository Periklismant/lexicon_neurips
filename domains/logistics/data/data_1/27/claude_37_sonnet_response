Let me first understand the initial state of the world. I noticed there's an issue with the initial state, as we have "Package t1 is in location l1_5", "Package t2 is in location l2_1", and so on, but t1 and t2 are actually trucks, and a1 and a2 are airplanes. So let me correct the initial state:

Initial state:
- "Location l1_1 is in city c1" (l1_1 is an airport)
- "Location l1_2 is in city c1"
- "Location l1_3 is in city c1"
- "Location l1_4 is in city c1"
- "Location l1_5 is in city c1"
- "Location l2_1 is in city c2" (l2_1 is an airport)
- "Location l2_2 is in city c2"
- "Location l2_3 is in city c2"
- "Location l2_4 is in city c2"
- "Location l2_5 is in city c2"
- "Truck t1 is in location l1_5" (assuming this is the correct interpretation)
- "Truck t2 is in location l2_1" (assuming this is the correct interpretation)
- "Package p1 is in location l2_2"
- "Package p2 is in location l1_3"
- "Airplane a1 is in location l1_1" (assuming this is the correct interpretation)
- "Airplane a2 is in location l2_1" (assuming this is the correct interpretation)

Goal state:
- "Package p1 is in location l2_5"
- "Package p2 is in location l1_1"

Constraints:
1. "Package p1 is in location l2_2" must hold in at least one state. (Note that p1 starts in l2_2, so this constraint is trivially satisfied if we have the actions in my plan start from the initial state)
2. If "Package p1 is in location l2_2" holds in some state s, then "At least one of the following conditions is true: "Package p1 is in location l1_4", "Package p2 is in location l1_2"" must hold at s or after s.

So the constraint 2 means that after p1 has been in l2_2, either p1 must be in l1_4 or p2 must be in l1_2 at some point before the end of the plan.

Let's plan how to get each package to its destination:

For p1, which needs to go from l2_2 to l2_5:
1. Use truck t2 to transport p1 within city c2 from l2_2 to l2_5.

For p2, which needs to go from l1_3 to l1_1:
1. Use truck t1 to transport p2 within city c1 from l1_3 to l1_1.

But we also need to ensure that the constraint is satisfied: After p1 is in l2_2, either p1 should be in l1_4 or p2 should be in l1_2 at some point.

Let's modify our plan. Since p1 starts in l2_2, we immediately need to satisfy the second constraint. So we need to either:
- Move p1 to l1_4, or
- Move p2 to l1_2.

Moving p1 to l1_4 would require using an airplane (since l1_4 is in city c1 while p1 starts in city c2). Moving p2 to l1_2 seems simpler since p2 starts in city c1. So let's modify the plan for p2:

For p2, which needs to go from l1_3 to l1_1:
1. Use truck t1 to transport p2 from l1_3 to l1_2 (satisfying the constraint).
2. Use truck t1 to transport p2 from l1_2 to l1_1.

For p1, which needs to go from l2_2 to l2_5:
1. Use truck t2 to transport p1 within city c2 from l2_2 to l2_5.

Let me check if there are any optimizations we can make:

For p1, we need to use truck t2, which starts in l2_1. So we need to move t2 from l2_1 to l2_2, load p1, and then move to l2_5 to unload.

For p2, we need to use truck t1, which starts in l1_5. So we need to move t1 from l1_5 to l1_3, load p2, move to l1_2 (to satisfy the constraint), and then move to l1_1 to unload.

Let's make the plan detailed:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2 (Move truck t2 from airport l2_1 to l2_2)
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (Load p1 into t2)
3. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1 (Move truck t1 from l1_5 to l1_3)
4. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (Load p2 into t1)
5. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1 (Move truck t1 from l1_3 to l1_2, satisfying the constraint)
6. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 (Move truck t1 from l1_2 to l1_1)
7. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (Unload p2 at l1_1, satisfying goal)
8. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2 (Move truck t2 from l2_2 to l2_5)
9. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (Unload p1 at l2_5, satisfying goal)

Wait, I need to check if this is valid with respect to the constraints. 

Constraint 1: "Package p1 is in location l2_2" must hold in at least one state.
This is satisfied in the initial state, as p1 starts in l2_2.

Constraint 2: If "Package p1 is in location l2_2" holds in some state s, then "At least one of the following conditions is true: "Package p1 is in location l1_4", "Package p2 is in location l1_2"" must hold at s or after s.
Since p1 starts in l2_2, we need to ensure that either p1 is in l1_4 or p2 is in l1_2 at some point in the plan. In our plan, p2 is in l1_2 after step 5, which satisfies this constraint.

So the plan is valid with respect to the constraints. Let's see if we can optimize it further.

Actually, there's a question I have: do we need to maintain the constraint throughout the plan, or is it okay if p1 is in l2_2 at some point and then later (not necessarily immediately after) p1 is in l1_4 or p2 is in l1_2?

Based on the constraint: "If expression "Package p1 is in location l2_2" holds in some state s, then expression "At least one of the following conditions is true: "Package p1 is in location l1_4", "Package p2 is in location l1_2"" must hold at s or at some state after s", it seems like the latter interpretation is correct. That is, once p1 has been in l2_2, at some point in the future (not necessarily immediately), either p1 should be in l1_4 or p2 should be in l1_2.

Now, p1 starts in l2_2, so the constraint will be triggered from the initial state. This means that at some point in our plan, either p1 must be in l1_4 or p2 must be in l1_2. In our current plan, p2 passes through l1_2, satisfying the constraint.

However, there's a subtlety here. What if we load p1 from l2_2 into t2 before p2 is in l1_2? Would the constraint still be satisfied?

Let's see... The constraint says: "If p1 is in l2_2 in state s, then p1 is in l1_4 or p2 is in l1_2 in state s or some state after s." So it doesn't matter if p1 leaves l2_2, as long as the requirement is met after p1 has been in l2_2. So yes, our plan is valid.

Let me restate the plan:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2 (Move truck t2 from airport l2_1 to l2_2)
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (Load p1 into t2)
3. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1 (Move truck t1 from l1_5 to l1_3)
4. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (Load p2 into t1)
5. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1 (Move truck t1 from l1_3 to l1_2, satisfying the constraint)
6. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 (Move truck t1 from l1_2 to l1_1)
7. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (Unload p2 at l1_1, satisfying goal)
8. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2 (Move truck t2 from l2_2 to l2_5)
9. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (Unload p1 at l2_5, satisfying goal)

I believe this plan is valid, optimal, and satisfies all constraints.

Actually, let me re-read the problem once more to make sure I understand the constraints correctly:

Constraint 1: "Package p1 is in location l2_2" must hold in at least one state. This is satisfied in the initial state, as p1 starts in l2_2.

Constraint 2: If "Package p1 is in location l2_2" holds in some state s, then "At least one of the following conditions is true: "Package p1 is in location l1_4", "Package p2 is in location l1_2"" must hold at s or at some state after s. 

The constraint means that once p1 has been in l2_2, at some point (at the same state or after), either p1 should be in l1_4 or p2 should be in l1_2. In our plan, p2 is in l1_2 after step 5, which is after p1 is in l2_2 (in the initial state), so this constraint is satisfied.

I think the current plan is valid and satisfies all constraints. Let's see if we can optimize it further.

One optimization we could make is to reorder the steps to minimize the total number of steps:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1 (Move truck t1 from l1_5 to l1_3)
2. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (Load p2 into t1)
3. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1 (Move truck t1 from l1_3 to l1_2, satisfying the constraint)
4. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 (Move truck t1 from l1_2 to l1_1)
5. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (Unload p2 at l1_1, satisfying goal)
6. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2 (Move truck t2 from airport l2_1 to l2_2)
7. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (Load p1 into t2)
8. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2 (Move truck t2 from l2_2 to l2_5)
9. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (Unload p1 at l2_5, satisfying goal)

But since they're independent sets of actions (one for p1 and one for p2), there's no real optimization here. The plan is still 9 steps.

Actually, I just realized there might be another interpretation of the constraint. The constraint says "If expression "Package p1 is in location l2_2" holds in some state s, then expression "At least one of the following conditions is true: "Package p1 is in location l1_4", "Package p2 is in location l1_2"" must hold at s or at some state after s". It's possible this means that at every state where p1 is in l2_2, either p1 is also in l1_4 (which is impossible) or p2 is in l1_2.

But this interpretation seems unreasonable to me. It would mean that whenever p1 is in l2_2, p2 must be in l1_2, which would make the problem quite restrictive. It seems more reasonable that the constraint requires that after p1 has been in l2_2, at some point (not necessarily immediately), either p1 should be in l1_4 or p2 should be in l1_2. Since p1 starts in l2_2, this means that at some point in the plan, either p1 must be in l1_4 or p2 must be in l1_2. And in our plan, p2 is in l1_2 at some point, which satisfies this constraint.

Given this interpretation, the plan is valid and optimal.

Actually, as I reread the constraint, I think I've been misunderstanding "at s or at some state after s." This means that once p1 is in l2_2, one of the conditions (p1 in l1_4 or p2 in l1_2) must be true at that same state or some state afterwards. In other words, it's not saying that p1 must be in l1_4 or p2 must be in l1_2 after p1 has left l2_2. It's saying that during the state when p1 is in l2_2, or in some state after that, one of those conditions must be true. Since p1 starts in l2_2 and at some point p2 is in l1_2, the constraint is satisfied.

So, the plan is valid and optimal under this interpretation as well.

But now I'm really confused. Let me re-examine the plan more carefully and check how the constraints unfold:

Initial state: p1:l2_2, p2:l1_3

Constraint check: p1 is in l2_2, so the condition has been triggered. Neither p1 is in l1_4 nor p2 is in l1_2, so the requirement has not yet been satisfied.

1. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1
   State: p1:l2_2, p2:l1_3
   Constraint check: the requirement has not yet been satisfied.

2. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
   State: p1:l2_2, p2:t1
   Constraint check: the requirement has not yet been satisfied.

3. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1
   State: p1:l2_2, p2:t1 (which is in l1_2)
   But p2 is in the truck, not in l1_2 directly, so this doesn't satisfy the constraint. Let's continue.

4. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (I'm modifying the plan here)
   State: p1:l2_2, p2:l1_2
   Constraint check: p2 is in l1_2, so the requirement is now satisfied.

5. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (loading p2 back into t1)
   State: p1:l2_2, p2:t1
   Constraint check: the requirement was already satisfied, so we're good.

6. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
   State: p1:l2_2, p2:t1
   Constraint check: the requirement was already satisfied, so we're good.

7. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
   State: p1:l2_2, p2:l1_1
   Constraint check: the requirement was already satisfied, so we're good.

8. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
   State: p1:l2_2, p2:l1_1
   Constraint check: the requirement was already satisfied, so we're good.

9. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
   State: p1:t2, p2:l1_1
   Constraint check: p1 is no longer in l2_2, but the requirement was already satisfied, so we're good.

10. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
    State: p1:t2, p2:l1_1
    Constraint check: p1 is not in l2_2, so the constraint is not triggered.

11. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
    State: p1:l2_5, p2:l1_1
    Constraint check: p1 is not in l2_2, so the constraint is not triggered.

Wait, I made an error in the plan. Let me revise it:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1
2. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
3. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1
4. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (This unloads p2 at l1_2, satisfying the constraint)
5. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (This loads p2 back into t1)
6. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
7. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
8. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
9. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
10. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
11. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

This plan has 11 steps, which is more than the 9 steps in the previous plan.

Actually, I now realize the constraint might be more subtle than I thought. The constraint says: "If expression "Package p1 is in location l2_2" holds in some state s, then expression "At least one of the following conditions is true: "Package p1 is in location l1_4", "Package p2 is in location l1_2"" must hold at s or at some state after s".

I think what the constraint means is this: If at any point p1 is in l2_2, then at that very same point or some point thereafter, either p1 must be in l1_4 or p2 must be in l1_2. And this is true regardless of whether p1 is still in l2_2.

So yes, the revised plan is valid, and satisfies the constraints. But it's not optimal because of the extra steps (unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 and loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2), which I added to ensure p2 is in l1_2 at some point to satisfy the constraint.

Let me think if there's a more optimal plan. The issue is that we need to have p2 in l1_2 at some point to satisfy the constraint. An alternative would be to have p1 in l1_4 at some point. But that would require an airplane, and it seems more complex.

So the best approach is to still have p2 in l1_2, but can we make it more efficient than the revised plan?

Actually, I just realized, the constraint doesn't say that p2 has to be outside a vehicle in l1_2. It just says that p2 is in l1_2. So if p2 is inside a truck in l1_2, would that satisfy the constraint? The constraint language is somewhat ambiguous, but I think a reasonable interpretation is that if p2 is inside a truck that is in l1_2, then p2 is not considered to be in l1_2, but rather in the truck.

With this interpretation, the previous plan that I tried to construct is not valid, and we need the revised plan that explicitly unloads p2 at l1_2 to satisfy the constraint.

But hold on, I don't think I understood the constraint correctly. Let me re-read the constraint:

"If expression "Package p1 is in location l2_2" holds in some state s, then expression "At least one of the following conditions is true: "Package p1 is in location l1_4", "Package p2 is in location l1_2"" must hold at s or at some state after s."

Okay, so if at any state s, p1 is in l2_2, then at that same state s or some state after, either p1 is in l1_4 or p2 is in l1_2. Since p1 starts in l2_2, this constraint is triggered from the initial state, and so at some point in the plan, either p1 must be in l1_4 or p2 must be in l1_2.

Now, here's where I'm confused. Does "p2 is in location l1_2" mean p2 is directly in l1_2, or can p2 be in a truck that's in l1_2?

Actually, I think I've been overthinking this. The original description states that "Package p2 is in location l1_3" in the initial state. And when it says "Package p1 is in location l2_2", it means that p1 is directly in l2_2, not in a vehicle that's in l2_2. So by the same token, "Package p2 is in location l1_2" means that p2 is directly in l1_2, not in a vehicle that's in l1_2.

So the revised plan is valid, but it has 11 steps, which seems longer than needed. Let me think if there's a more optimal plan.

Actually, I think the most efficient way to satisfy the constraint is to unload p2 at l1_2, load it back in, and continue to the destination. This is exactly what the revised plan does. So I believe the revised plan is optimal.

But wait, if I rethink about the problem statement, it says "Locations l1_1 and l2_1 are airports. I'm wondering if we can use airplanes to make the plan more efficient? Since p1 needs to be in l1_4 or p2 needs to be in l1_2, and we're going with the latter option, I don't think using airplanes helps in this case. 

Actually, let's be precise about what the constraint requires. It says, "If p1 is in l2_2, then p1 must be in l1_4 or p2 must be in l1_2, at that state or some state after that." Since p1 starts in l2_2, this constraint is triggered from the initial state, and so at some point in the plan, either p1 must be in l1_4 or p2 must be in l1_2.

The revised plan that I proposed does satisfy this constraint, as it explicitly unloads p2 at l1_2. But I'm wondering if there's a more efficient way to satisfy the constraint.

One approach would be to use a1 (which starts at l1_1) to fly to the airport in c2 (l2_1), pick up p1 from l2_2 (which would require driving t2 from l2_1 to l2_2, loading p1, driving back to l2_1, unloading p1, and loading p1 into a1), then fly a1 to l1_1, and from there, drive p1 to l1_4 to satisfy the constraint, then drive it to its destination. But this seems quite complex and would require more steps than the revised plan.

So, I believe the revised plan that I proposed is the most efficient:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1
2. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
3. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1
4. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (This unloads p2 at l1_2, satisfying the constraint)
5. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (This loads p2 back into t1)
6. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
7. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
8. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
9. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
10. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
11. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

This plan satisfies all requirements and the constraints and is 11 steps.

Wait, I noticed I'm being a bit inconsistent. At the start of my analysis, I revised the initial state to state that:
"Truck t1 is in location l1_5" (assuming this is the correct interpretation)
"Truck t2 is in location l2_1" (assuming this is the correct interpretation)
"Package p1 is in location l2_2"
"Package p2 is in location l1_3"
"Airplane a1 is in location l1_1" (assuming this is the correct interpretation)
"Airplane a2 is in location l2_1" (assuming this is the correct interpretation)

The plan I've constructed is based on this revised initial state. Let's double-check against the original initial state:
"Package t1 is in location l1_5"
"Package t2 is in location l2_1"
"Package p1 is in location l2_2"
"Package p2 is in location l1_3"
"Package a1 is in location l1_1"
"Package a2 is in location l2_1"

The first line, "Package t1 is in location l1_5", is confusing, as t1 is a truck, not a package. I wonder if this is a typo and should be "Truck t1 is in location l1_5". The same issue arises with t2, a1, and a2. Since these objects are denoted as trucks and airplanes, I assumed that the initial state should be:
"Truck t1 is in location l1_5"
"Truck t2 is in location l2_1"
"Package p1 is in location l2_2"
"Package p2 is in location l1_3"
"Airplane a1 is in location l1_1"
"Airplane a2 is in location l2_1"

So the plan I've constructed is based on this revised initial state.

Hmm, let's think about this again. I need to make sure I've interpreted the constraints correctly. Rather than overthinking it, let's just reason through it step by step.

Constraint 1: "Package p1 is in location l2_2" must hold in at least one state. This is satisfied in the initial state, as p1 starts in l2_2.

Constraint 2: If "Package p1 is in location l2_2" holds in some state s, then "At least one of the following conditions is true: "Package p1 is in location l1_4", "Package p2 is in location l1_2"" must hold at s or at some state after s.

This means: once p1 is observed in l2_2, at some point from then onwards, either p1 must be in l1_4 or p2 must be in l1_2.

Since p1 starts in l2_2, this means that at some point in the plan, either p1 must be in l1_4 or p2 must be in l1_2.

In the revised plan, p2 is in l1_2 at step 4, which is after the initial state where p1 is in l2_2. So the constraint is satisfied. And this plan is 11 steps.

Let's quickly check if there's an even more efficient way to satisfy the constraint. For example, what if we use an airplane to move p1 from l2_2 to l1_4? This would require:
1. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2 (Move truck t2 from airport l2_1 to l2_2)
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (Load p1 into t2)
3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 (Move truck t2 from l2_2 to airport l2_1)
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (Unload p1 at l2_1)
5. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (Load p1 into airplane a2)
6. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (Fly airplane a2 from l2_1 to l1_1)
7. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (Unload p1 at l1_1)
8. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (Load p1 into truck t1)
9. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1 (Move truck t1 from l1_1 to l1_4, satisfying the constraint)
10. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4 (Unload p1 at l1_4)
11. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4 (Load p1 back into t1)
12. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 (Move truck t1 back to l1_1)
13. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (Unload p1 at l1_1)
14. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (Load p1 into airplane a2)
15. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1 (Fly airplane a2 from l1_1 to l2_1)
16. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (Unload p1 at l2_1)
17. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (Load p1 into truck t2)
18. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2 (Move truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_5)
19. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (Unload p1 at l2_5, satisfying goal)
20. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1 (Move truck t1 from l1_1 to l1_3)
21. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (Load p2 into t1)
22. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1 (Move truck t1 from l1_3 to l1_1)
23. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (Unload p2 at l1_1, satisfying goal)

This is 23 steps, which is way more than the 11 steps in the revised plan.

It seems like the most efficient way to satisfy the constraint is to unload p2 at l1_2, load it back in, and continue to the destination. This is exactly what the revised plan does. So I believe the revised plan is optimal.

```
drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
```

I'm now confident that this plan is optimal, valid, and satisfies all constraints.

But wait, I realized I've been inconsistent again. I can parallelize operations on p1 and p2, since they are independent of each other. Let me reorder the steps and see if we can reduce the total number of steps:

```
drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
```

But that still requires 11 steps. I don't think we can reduce this.

Actually, I think I've been overthinking this. Let's just go with the simple plan, which is 9 steps, as I initially planned:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2 (Move truck t2 from airport l2_1 to l2_2)
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (Load p1 into t2)
3. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1 (Move truck t1 from l1_5 to l1_3)
4. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (Load p2 into t1)
5. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1 (Move truck t1 from l1_3 to l1_2, satisfying the constraint)
6. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 (Move truck t1 from l1_2 to l1_1)
7. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (Unload p2 at l1_1, satisfying goal)
8. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2 (Move truck t2 from l2_2 to l2_5)
9. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (Unload p1 at l2_5, satisfying goal)

But have I correctly interpreted the constraint? To check, when would the constraint be violated?

The constraint would be violated if p1 is in l2_2 at some state s, and neither p1 is in l1_4 nor p2 is in l1_2 at state s or any state after s.

But wait, this doesn't seem right. Let's denote the constraint as:
`At state s, p1 in l2_2 => At state s' where s' >= s, p1 in l1_4 or p2 in l1_2`.

If we satisfy the constraint, it would mean:
`At state s, p1 in l2_2 => At state s' where s' >= s, p1 in l1_4 or p2 in l1_2`.

But if p1 is in l2_2 and p2 is in l1_2 simultaneously, the constraint is immediately satisfied, and there would be no need to proceed or maintain the constraint later. But if p1 is in l2_2 and p2 is not in l1_2, then we need to ensure that either p1 is in l1_4 or p2 is in l1_2 at some point in the future.

In step 5 of the plan, we move truck t1 (which contains p2) to l1_2. But p2 is still in the truck, not in l1_2 directly. So, does this actually satisfy the constraint?

It's a bit unclear, but to be safe, let's go with the explicit unload/load of p2 in l1_2, which gives us the 11-step plan:

```
drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
```

This plan seems to be the most conservative and definitely satisfies the constraints. 

However it's not the most efficient. I think the most efficient plan is the 9-step plan I laid out earlier, but to make it work, I need to understand precisely what "Package p2 is in location l1_2" means. If the package is in a truck which is in location l1_2, is the package considered to be in location l1_2? If so, then the 9-step plan is valid; otherwise, the 11-step plan is the way to go.

Actually, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let's look at the constraints again:

If "Package p1 is in location l2_2" holds in state s, then "Either p1 is in l1_4 or p2 is in l1_2" must hold in s or some state after s.

What the constraint means is that once p1 appears in l2_2, then at some point (at the same time or later), either p1 should appear in l1_4 or p2 should appear in l1_2. Now, by "appear in," I think the constraint is referring to a package being directly in a location, not in a vehicle that's in that location. So, moving a truck containing p2 to l1_2 doesn't make p2 appear in l1_2; p2 only appears in l1_2 if it's unloaded from the truck in l1_2.

After reading the problem again, one might think think it is more correct to consider a package "at" or "in" a location if it is at that location directly, or in a vehicle that is at that location. But this is complicated by the notion of "in" a truck versus "at" a location. Let's go back to the problem statement:

"Package p1 is in location l2_2."
"Package p2 is in location l1_3."
"Truck t1 is in location l1_5."
"Truck t2 is in location l2_1."
"Airplane a1 is in location l1_1."
"Airplane a2 is in location l2_1."

Here, I think "in location" means that the package, truck, or airplane is directly at that location, not that it's in a vehicle at that location.

So when the constraint says "Package p2 is in location l1_2," I believe it means that p2 is directly at l1_2, not that it's in a vehicle at l1_2.

Given this, the correct plan is the 11-step plan, which is:

```
drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
```

This plan satisfies all constraints and achieves the goals, though it's not the most efficient if we consider a package "in" a location if it's in a vehicle at that location. But I think the safer interpretation is that a package is "in" a location only if it's directly at that location, not if it's in a vehicle at that location.

I hope this clarifies the understanding of the constraints. The 11-step plan is correct and satisfies all constraints and goals.

Ok, I'm confident that the following plan is valid:

```
drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
```
