Okay, let's try to figure out how to solve this planning problem. So, the goal is to get both p1 and p2 into l2_5. The constraints say that at some point, p1 must be in l2_4. Let's start by looking at where everything is initially.

First, the initial state:

- p1 is in l2_2, which is in city c2.
- p2 is in l1_4, which is in city c1.
- Trucks t1 is in l1_2 (c1), t2 is in l2_5 (c2).
- Airplanes a1 is in l1_1 (c1's airport), a2 is in l2_1 (c2's airport).

The goal requires both packages in l2_5. But l2_5 is in c2. So p2 needs to move from c1 to c2. Since airplanes can move between airports, we'll probably need to fly a1 or a2. Wait, a1 is in c1's airport (l1_1), and a2 is in c2's airport (l2_1). So maybe use a1 to carry p2 from c1 to c2. But how?

Let's break it down step by step.

For p2 (in l1_4, c1):

1. Move p2 from l1_4 to l1_1 (the airport) using truck t1. Because t1 is in l1_2. Wait, t1 is in l1_2. So first, drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_4. Then load p2 into t1. Then drive t1 to l1_1 (airport), unload p2 there. Then load p2 onto airplane a1. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1 (c2's airport). Then unload p2 from a1 at l2_1. Then use truck t2 (which is in l2_5) but wait, l2_5 is in c2. So to get p2 to l2_5, we need to move it from l2_1 to l2_5. But t2 is already in l2_5. Wait, t2 is in l2_5. So we need to drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1? No, wait, initial state says "Package t2 is in location l2_5" — wait, no. Wait, the original state says "Package t2 is in location l2_5". Wait, that's a typo? Because t2 is a truck. Oh, the user probably made a mistake in the original state. Wait, looking back:

Original state:

"Package t1 is in location l1_2"

"Package t2 is in location l2_5"

Wait, that can't be right. Because t1 and t2 are trucks, not packages. So maybe that's a typo. The user probably meant "Truck t1 is in location l1_2" and "Truck t2 is in location l2_5". Because otherwise, the packages are p1 and p2, and the trucks are t1 and t2. So I think the user made a mistake in the original state description. Let me check again.

In the original state, under "The original state of the world is the following:", there's:

"Package t1 is in location l1_2"

"Package t2 is in location l2_5"

Wait, that's impossible because t1 and t2 are trucks. So this must be a mistake. Probably, it's supposed to be "Truck t1 is in location l1_2" and "Truck t2 is in location l2_5". Otherwise, we have packages named t1 and t2, which would conflict with the trucks. So assuming that's a typo, and the correct initial positions are:

- Truck t1 is in l1_2 (c1)
- Truck t2 is in l2_5 (c2)
- Airplane a1 is in l1_1 (c1)
- Airplane a2 is in l2_1 (c2)

Packages:

- p1 is in l2_2 (c2)
- p2 is in l1_4 (c1)

So with that corrected, let's proceed.

For p2 to get to c2's l2_5:

1. Use truck t1 (in l1_2) to drive to l1_4, load p2, drive to l1_1 (airport), unload p2.
2. Load p2 onto airplane a1 (which is at l1_1), fly a1 to l2_1 (c2's airport).
3. Unload p2 from a1 at l2_1. Then use truck t2 (which is in l2_5) to drive to l2_1, load p2, drive back to l2_5, unload.

Wait, but t2 is in l2_5. So to get p2 from l2_1 (where it's unloaded from the airplane) to l2_5, we need to move it via truck. So truck t2 would need to go from l2_5 to l2_1, load p2, then drive back to l2_5. But that's possible. Because cities allow trucks to move between their locations. So l2_1 is in c2, and l2_5 is in c2. So the truck can drive between them.

So steps for p2:

- Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_4 (c1)
- Load p2 into t1 at l1_4
- Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1 (airport)
- Unload p2 at l1_1
- Load p2 into a1 at l1_1
- Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1
- Unload p2 from a1 at l2_1
- Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (but wait, t2 starts at l2_5. So drive t2 to l2_1, load p2, then drive back to l2_5 and unload.

But that's three actions for the truck: drive to l2_1, load, drive back.

For p1, which is in l2_2 (c2). Need to get to l2_5. Also, the constraint is that p1 must be in l2_4 at some point. So the plan for p1 must go through l2_4.

Possible path for p1:

Use truck t2, but t2 is in l2_5. Wait, but p1 is in l2_2. So maybe another truck? Wait, the trucks are t1 (in c1) and t2 (in c2, l2_5). So in c2, the truck available is t2. So t2 can drive around c2's locations.

So for p1:

1. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2 (if possible). Wait, c2's locations are l2_1 (airport), l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5. So yes, the truck can drive between these. So drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2, load p1, then drive to l2_4 (to satisfy the constraint), unload p1 there (so now p1 is in l2_4), then reload and drive to l2_5.

Wait, but how to get p1 from l2_2 to l2_4 using t2.

So:

- Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2 (action: drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2)
- Load p1 into t2 at l2_2
- Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_4 (satisfies the constraint when p1 is unloaded here)
- Unload p1 at l2_4 (now the constraint is met)
- Then load p1 again into t2 at l2_4
- Drive t2 to l2_5
- Unload p1 at l2_5

But this would work. However, this adds steps. Alternatively, if there's another way. But since the constraint is that p1 must be in l2_4 at some state, we have to ensure that. So in this plan, after unloading at l2_4, that's when the constraint is satisfied.

Now, combining both p1 and p2's plans.

But wait, t2 is used for both packages. Because for p2, after flying to l2_1, we need t2 to drive from l2_5 to l2_1, load p2, drive back. But if we first handle p1's movement, which uses t2, then after that, t2 is at l2_5 again (after delivering p1), then we can use it for p2. But the timing has to be considered.

Wait, let's outline all steps:

For p1:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (constraint met here)
5. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
6. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2
7. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

For p2:

After p1 is delivered:

8. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 (but after step 7, t2 is at l2_5)
9. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (assuming p2 is at l2_1)
10. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
11. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5

But for p2, after flying to l2_1, we need to have it unloaded there. So steps for p2:

Meanwhile, for p2:

a. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1
b. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
c. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
d. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
e. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
f. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
g. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (now p2 is at l2_1)
h. Then steps 8-11 as above.

But the problem is that steps 8-11 (using t2 to move p2) must happen after step g. But in the p1 steps, after step 7 (p1 delivered to l2_5), t2 is at l2_5. So then, to get p2 from l2_1 to l2_5:

- Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (step 8)
- Load p2 into t2 (step 9)
- Drive back to l2_5 (step 10)
- Unload (step 11)

So combining both packages' steps, the plan would be:

Order of actions:

1. Handle p1 first, then p2.

But to optimize, maybe interleave steps if possible. But since t2 is needed for both, the steps must be sequential. So first process p1's steps 1-7, then p2's steps a-g and then steps 8-11.

Wait, but the steps a-g for p2 can happen in parallel with p1's steps, but since t2 is involved in both, maybe not. Let's see.

Wait, t1 is in c1, handling p2, and t2 is in c2 handling p1. So they can be done in parallel. But the airplanes are a1 in c1 and a2 in c2. So for p2, using a1 to fly to c2. So the steps for p2 would be:

a. Drive t1 to l1_4
b. Load p2 into t1
c. Drive t1 to l1_1
d. Unload p2 at l1_1
e. Load p2 into a1
f. Fly a1 to l2_1
g. Unload p2 from a1 at l2_1

These steps can be done in parallel with p1's steps as long as there's no dependency. Then, after both a1 has delivered p2 to l2_1 and t2 has delivered p1 to l2_5, then t2 can be used to move p2 from l2_1 to l2_5.

So the plan would be:

For p1:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
5. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
6. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2
7. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

For p2:

8. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1
9. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
10. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
11. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
12. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
13. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
14. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

Then, moving p2 from l2_1 to l2_5 using t2 (after t2 has finished moving p1):

15. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
16. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
17. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
18. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5

So total 18 steps. But is this the optimal? Maybe there's a way to reduce steps.

Wait, when moving p1, after unloading at l2_4 (step4), we load again (step5) and drive to l2_5. So steps 3-6 are for moving p1 from l2_2 to l2_4, then to l2_5. Alternatively, could we drive directly from l2_2 to l2_5? But the constraint requires that p1 is in l2_4 at some point. So we have to pass through l2_4. So steps 3 and 4 are necessary.

Alternatively, perhaps after unloading p1 at l2_4 (step4), could we use another truck to take it to l2_5? But the only truck in c2 is t2. So no, t2 has to do it.

So steps 3-7 are necessary for p1.

Now, for p2, after step14 (p2 is at l2_1), the steps 15-18 are needed. But can we combine steps? For example, after step7, t2 is at l2_5. So steps15-18: drive to l2_1, load, drive back, unload. That's four steps.

Alternatively, can we have t2 pick up p2 while moving for p1? Like, after step3 (t2 is at l2_4), but that's not near l2_1. No, probably not.

Another thought: Could we use the airplane a2 (which is at l2_1) to move p1? But p1 is in l2_2, which is not an airport. So perhaps not. Airplanes can only move between airports. So p1 would need to be taken to an airport (l2_1) via truck, then loaded onto a2 and flown... but that's longer than using the truck directly.

So probably the initial plan is the way to go.

But let's check if the steps can be optimized. For example, when moving p2, after unloading at l2_1, t2 is at l2_5. So t2 has to drive to l2_1, load p2, drive back. That's 4 steps. But what if instead, when delivering p1, after step4 (unload at l2_4), instead of reloading and driving to l2_5, t2 could go to l2_1 to pick up p2 and then go to l2_5. But that would complicate the steps. Let's think:

Alternative plan for p1 and p2:

1. t2 drives from l2_5 to l2_2 (step1)
2. load p1 (step2)
3. drive to l2_4 (step3)
4. unload p1 (step4, constraint met)
5. Now, t2 is at l2_4. Instead of loading p1 again, drive to l2_1 to pick up p2. But p2 hasn't arrived yet. So timing is an issue.

Wait, p2 arrives at l2_1 via airplane after step14. So maybe after step4, t2 could drive to l2_1, but p2 isn't there yet. So this approach would require waiting for p2 to arrive. But in the initial plan, after p1 is delivered to l2_5 (step7), then t2 is at l2_5 and can be used to move p2.

But perhaps combining steps for p1 and p2. For example:

After step4 (p1 in l2_4), t2 is in l2_4. Could t2 then drive to l2_1 (but that's a location in c2). So possible. Then:

5. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
6. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (assuming p2 is already there)
7. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
8. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5

But this would require p2 to be at l2_1 before step5. So if we can arrange the steps such that the airplane brings p2 to l2_1 before t2 arrives there. Let's see:

For p2:

a. t1 moves p2 to l1_1 (steps8-11)
b. airplane flies to l2_1 (steps12-14)
So p2 is at l2_1 by step14.

Meanwhile, for p1:

After step4 (unload p1 at l2_4), t2 can drive to l2_1 (step5), load p2 (step6), drive to l2_5 (step7), unload p2 (step8), then return to l2_4 to pick up p1. Wait, but p1 is still in l2_4. So after dropping off p2, t2 would need to go back to l2_4, load p1, then drive to l2_5. That adds steps. Let's outline:

p1's steps:

1. drive t2 to l2_2 (step1)
2. load p1 (step2)
3. drive to l2_4 (step3)
4. unload p1 (step4)
5. drive t2 to l2_1 (step5)
6. load p2 (step6)
7. drive to l2_5 (step7)
8. unload p2 (step8)
9. drive t2 to l2_4 (step9)
10. load p1 (step10)
11. drive to l2_5 (step11)
12. unload p1 (step12)

This way, p1 is delivered in step12, and p2 in step8. But this requires more steps (12) compared to the initial plan which had 18 steps. Wait, no, the initial plan was 18 steps. But perhaps this approach reduces steps.

But let's count. For the alternative plan:

For p2:

Same as before (steps8-14: moving p2 via t1 and a1 to l2_1).

For p1 and combined steps:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (constraint met)
5. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2 (now t2 is at l2_1)
6. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (assuming p2 is here)
7. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
8. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 (p2 done)
9. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2 (back to get p1)
10. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
11. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2
12. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (p1 done)

So steps 1-12 for p1 and combined steps, plus steps for p2:

a. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1
b. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
c. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
d. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
e. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
f. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
g. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (step14)

So total steps: 12 (p1) + 7 (p2) = 19? Wait, no, because the steps for p2 (a-g) are 7 actions, and steps 1-12 for p1 are 12 actions. So total 19. But the previous plan had 18. Hmm, maybe not better. Also, step5 for t2 going from l2_4 to l2_1, which is allowed since they're both in c2.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to interleave the steps so that the airplane flies while the truck is moving. But since they are in different cities, the order doesn't matter except for dependencies.

Wait, in the alternative plan, after step4 (unload p1 at l2_4), t2 drives to l2_1 (step5). But for p2 to be at l2_1, the airplane must have already arrived. So step14 (unload p2 at l2_1) must be before step6 (load p2 into t2). Therefore, steps for p2 must complete up to step14 before step6.

So the order would be:

- Complete p2's steps a-g (up to step14) first, then process p1 and p2's steps.

But that's not possible because p2's steps require t1 and a1, which are in c1, and p1's steps are in c2 with t2. So they can be done in parallel.

But the problem is that step6 (loading p2 into t2) requires p2 to be at l2_1, which happens after step14. So the sequence would be:

For p2:

a. t1 moves p2 to l1_1 (steps8-11)
b. load into a1 (step12)
c. fly to l2_1 (step13)
d. unload (step14)

For p1:

1. t2 moves to l2_2 (step1)
2. load p1 (step2)
3. drive to l2_4 (step3)
4. unload p1 (step4)
5. drive to l2_1 (step5) — but this can't happen until p2 is unloaded at l2_1 (step14)
6. load p2 (step6)
7. drive to l2_5 (step7)
8. unload p2 (step8)
9. drive back to l2_4 (step9)
10. load p1 (step10)
11. drive to l2_5 (step11)
12. unload p1 (step12)

So the order must be such that steps a-g (p2) are done before step6 (loading p2 into t2). But steps1-4 (p1) can be done in parallel with steps a-g (p2), as long as step14 is done before step6.

But in reality, the planner has to sequence all actions linearly. So the correct order would be:

- First, perform steps a-g (p2's movement to l2_1)
- Then steps1-4 (p1's movement to l2_4)
- Then steps5-8 (t2 moves to l2_1, loads p2, delivers to l2_5)
- Then steps9-12 (t2 picks up p1 and delivers to l2_5)

But this approach would require:

Total steps:

For p2:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1 (a)
2. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (b)
3. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 (c)
4. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (d)
5. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (e)
6. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (f)
7. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (g)

For p1 and combined:

8. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2 (step1)
9. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (step2)
10. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2 (step3)
11. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (step4)
12. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2 (step5)
13. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (step6)
14. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2 (step7)
15. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 (step8)
16. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2 (step9)
17. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (step10)
18. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2 (step11)
19. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (step12)

Total steps: 19. But this is longer than the initial 18 steps.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to optimize. Let's go back to the initial plan.

Initial plan steps:

p1: 7 steps
p2: 7 steps (a-g) + 4 steps (15-18) = 11 steps
Total: 7 + 11 = 18 steps.

But is there a way to reduce this?

Wait, in the initial plan, after delivering p1 to l2_5 (step7), t2 is at l2_5. Then it needs to go to l2_1 to pick up p2. So steps15-18 are:

15. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
16. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
17. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
18. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5

But perhaps we can combine these steps with the earlier steps for p1. For example, after step7 (p1 is delivered), t2 is at l2_5. Then drive to l2_1 (step15), load p2 (step16), drive back (step17), unload (step18). That's four steps.

Alternatively, can we have t2 do something else during the p2's flight to l2_1?

But no, because the airplane steps (flying) are separate. So the initial plan's 18 steps may be the minimal.

But maybe there's a smarter way. Let's think about using airplane a2 for p1.

Wait, p1 is in l2_2 (c2). To use an airplane, we need to get p1 to an airport. l2_1 is the airport in c2. So:

Alternative approach for p1:

1. Use truck t2 to move p1 from l2_2 to l2_1 (airport).
2. Load onto a2 (which is already at l2_1).
3. Fly a2 to l2_1? No, that's the same place. Wait, airports are only l1_1 and l2_1. So perhaps fly to another airport, but that's not necessary. Wait, the goal is to get p1 to l2_5. So if we can't fly, then truck is the only option.

Wait, this approach would be:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2 (since t2 starts at l2_5)
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 (airport)
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
5. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
6. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l2_1 (no, can't fly to same location)
So that's not useful. So the only way is to use the truck to move p1 through l2_4 to meet the constraint.

So the initial plan is necessary.

Thus, the initial plan of 18 steps might be the optimal. But perhaps there's a way to reduce steps by reusing the airplane for p1.

Alternatively, maybe not. Let's confirm.

Another idea: After unloading p1 at l2_4 (step4), can we use airplane a2 to move p1 from l2_4 to l2_5? But airplanes can only land at airports. l2_4 is not an airport. So no. So p1 must be moved by truck.

Thus, the initial plan is necessary.

Now, checking for optimality. The initial plan is 18 steps. Is there a way to have fewer steps?

Wait, maybe the steps for moving p2 can be optimized. For example, after p2 is unloaded at l2_1 (step14), can we use airplane a2 to fly it to l2_5's airport? But l2_5 is not an airport. The airports are l1_1 and l2_1. So airplanes can only land at airports. So the only airports are l1_1 and l2_1. Therefore, to get p2 from l2_1 to l2_5, you have to use a truck. So that's unavoidable.

So steps15-18 are necessary for p2.

Therefore, the initial plan of 18 steps is the optimal.

But wait, let's count again:

For p1:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
5. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
6. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2
7. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (7 steps)

For p2:

8. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1
9. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
10. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
11. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
12. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
13. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
14. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
15. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
16. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
17. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
18. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5

Yes, that's 18 steps. Now, is there a way to optimize by combining steps?

For example, after step7, t2 is at l2_5. Then steps15-18 are needed for p2. But what if we can use a different truck? But there's no other truck in c2. Only t2.

Alternatively, can we use airplane a2 to carry p2 from l2_1 to l2_1 (no), or another airport? No. So no.

Thus, this is the minimal steps.

Now, verifying that all preconditions are met in each step.

Let's check some key steps:

For p1's steps:

Step1: drivetruck t2 from l2_5 to l2_2. Preconditions: t2 is in l2_5 (yes, initial state), and l_from and l_to are in c2 (yes).

Step2: load p1 into t2 at l2_2. Preconditions: p1 and t2 are in l2_2. After step1, t2 is in l2_2. p1 is initially in l2_2 (yes).

Step3: drive to l2_4. Preconditions: t2 is in l2_2. Yes.

Step4: unload p1 at l2_4. Preconditions: t2 is in l2_4, p1 is in t2. Yes.

Step5: load p1 again into t2. Now, p1 is in l2_4, t2 is in l2_4. So after unloading, p1 is in l2_4. Then loading requires p1 and t2 to be in the same location. So yes.

Step6: drive to l2_5. Preconditions met.

Step7: unload. Yes.

For p2's steps:

Step8: drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_4. Correct.

Step9: load p2 into t1 at l1_4. p2 is in l1_4 initially (yes), and t1 is now there after step8.

Step10: drive to l1_1. Correct.

Step11: unload p2 at l1_1. Yes.

Step12: load p2 into a1 at l1_1. a1 is there (initial state), p2 is there after step11.

Step13: fly a1 to l2_1. Yes.

Step14: unload p2 at l2_1. Yes.

Step15: drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1. After step7, t2 is at l2_5.

Step16: load p2 into t2 at l2_1. After step14, p2 is at l2_1. t2 is there after step15.

Step17: drive back to l2_5.

Step18: unload p2. Correct.

All preconditions are met.

The constraint is that p1 is in l2_4 at least once. This occurs at step4 when p1 is unloaded there. So the constraint is satisfied.

Therefore, the plan is valid and meets all requirements. Also, it's 18 steps, which I believe is the minimal possible.
