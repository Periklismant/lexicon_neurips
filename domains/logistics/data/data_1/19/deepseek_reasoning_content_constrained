Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. First, I need to understand the initial state, the goal, and the constraints. 

The initial state has packages p1 at l2_3 and p2 at l2_5. Both are in city c2. The goal is to have p1 at l2_4 and p2 back at l2_1. Also, there are constraints: the condition that p2 is in l2_1 must hold at least once (which it does in the goal, so that's covered). But there's another constraint: if p2 is in l2_1 in any state, there must be an earlier state where either p2 was in l1_4 or p1 was in l2_5. 

Wait, the initial state says p2 is in l2_5. So initially, p2 is in l2_5. So the constraint would already be satisfied because p2 is in l2_5 initially. So when we later have p2 in l2_1 (which is part of the goal), the earlier state (the initial state) already has p2 in l2_5. So maybe we don't have to worry about that constraint because it's automatically satisfied. But I need to make sure that in the plan, when p2 is moved to l2_1, there was a prior state where p2 was in l2_5. Since the initial state has p2 in l2_5, that's already true. So perhaps the constraint is satisfied by the initial state. But maybe the plan needs to ensure that p2 is moved back to l2_1 from somewhere else, but the initial position is l2_5. Wait, the goal is for p2 to be in l2_1. So maybe the plan just needs to move p2 from l2_5 to l2_1. But the initial state says p2 is at l2_5. Let me check the original state again.

Wait, the original state says "Package p2 is in location l2_5". So the initial position of p2 is l2_5, and the goal is to have it in l2_1. So moving p2 from l2_5 to l2_1 would satisfy the goal. But according to the constraint, whenever p2 is in l2_1 (which is the goal), there must have been an earlier state where p2 was in l1_4 or p1 in l2_5. But initially, p2 is in l2_5. So when we move p2 to l2_1, the initial state already has p2 in l2_5, so the constraint is satisfied. Therefore, moving p2 directly from l2_5 to l2_1 is allowed. But wait, maybe the constraint is that in the plan's execution, when p2 arrives at l2_1, there was a prior state where either p2 was in l1_4 or p1 was in l2_5. Since in the initial state p2 is in l2_5, that's already satisfied. So the plan can just move p2 to l2_1 without any issue. But perhaps the problem is more complex.

Now, looking at the other package, p1 needs to go from l2_3 to l2_4. Both are in c2. Let's see the available trucks and airplanes. The trucks are t1 and t2. The initial locations: "Package t1 is in location l1_4" â€” wait, that must be a typo. Wait, the original state says "Package t1 is in location l1_4". Wait, t1 is a truck, not a package. Wait, that's a mistake in the problem statement. Let me check again. The original state includes:

"Package t1 is in location l1_4"
"Package t2 is in location l2_1"
"Package p1 is in location l2_3"
"Package p2 is in location l2_5"
"Package a1 is in location l1_1"
"Package a2 is in location l2_1"

Wait, that can't be right. Trucks (t1, t2) and airplanes (a1, a2) are vehicles, not packages. But the problem statement lists them as "Package t1", which must be an error. Probably, the correct initial state should be:

"Truck t1 is in location l1_4"
"Truck t2 is in location l2_1"
"Airplane a1 is in location l1_1"
"Airplane a2 is in location l2_1"

But the problem statement lists them as packages. So this is a critical mistake. However, since the user provided this, I have to work with it. But logically, trucks and airplanes are not packages. This must be a typo. Assuming that the problem statement intended to say that the trucks and airplanes are in those locations, not packages. So I'll proceed under the assumption that the initial state is:

Truck t1 is at l1_4 (city c1)
Truck t2 is at l2_1 (city c2)
Airplane a1 is at l1_1 (airport in c1)
Airplane a2 is at l2_1 (airport in c2)
Packages: p1 at l2_3, p2 at l2_5.

But according to the problem statement's original state, the entries for t1, t2, a1, a2 are listed as packages, which is incorrect. But perhaps this is a formatting error. For example, perhaps the line should be "Truck t1 is in location l1_4", etc. Otherwise, if t1 is a package, then the actions involving trucks (like drivetruck) can't be used. Therefore, I must assume that there's a typo in the problem statement and that the entries for t1, t2, a1, a2 are actually their locations as trucks and airplanes, not packages. Otherwise, the problem is unsolvable because you can't drive a package as a truck.

So proceeding under that correction:

Truck t1 is in l1_4 (city c1)
Truck t2 is in l2_1 (city c2)
Airplane a1 is in l1_1 (c1's airport)
Airplane a2 is in l2_1 (c2's airport)
Packages p1 at l2_3 (c2), p2 at l2_5 (c2).

Now, the goal is p1 in l2_4 (c2) and p2 in l2_1 (c2). 

Constraints: The constraint about p2 being in l2_1 must be true at least once (which is the goal), and if p2 is in l2_1 in any state, then before that, either p2 was in l1_4 or p1 was in l2_5. Since the initial state has p2 in l2_5, the constraint is already satisfied for the goal. So moving p2 to l2_1 is allowed because the initial state has p2 in l2_5. So even if the plan just moves p2 from l2_5 to l2_1 directly (if possible), that would satisfy the constraints. But how?

But how to move p2. Let's see: p2 is at l2_5 in c2. To get it to l2_1 (which is the airport of c2). Since l2_1 is an airport, perhaps using an airplane. But to load p2 into an airplane, the airplane must be at the same location. Airplane a2 is at l2_1. So if we can get p2 to l2_1, then maybe unload it there. Wait, but the goal is to have p2 in l2_1. So maybe p2 is already at l2_1 in the initial state? Wait, no. The original state says "Package p2 is in location l2_5". So p2 starts at l2_5. So the goal is to move it to l2_1.

So to move p2 from l2_5 to l2_1. Let's look at the cities. Both l2_5 and l2_1 are in c2. Since l2_1 is the airport, perhaps we can use a truck to move it. Truck t2 is at l2_1. So to move p2 from l2_5 to l2_1, we need a truck in c2 that can go from l2_5 to l2_1. But in c2, the locations are l2_1 (airport), l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5. The truck t2 is at l2_1. So the steps would be:

1. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_5 (c2). But can the truck move between locations in the same city. The drivetruck action allows moving between any two locations in the same city. So t2 can drive from l2_1 to l2_5. Then load p2 into t2 at l2_5, then drive back to l2_1, unload p2 there. But wait, trucks can carry packages. So:

- drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2 (truck moves to l2_5)
- loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 (since p2 is there)
- drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
- unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

That would get p2 to l2_1. But let's check the steps:

Initial state: p2 at l2_5, t2 at l2_1.

So first, drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_5. Then load p2 into t2. Then drive back to l2_1 and unload. That would work.

For p1, which is at l2_3 (c2), needs to go to l2_4. Both are in c2. So use truck t2 again. But t2 is at l2_1 initially. Wait, but after moving p2, t2 would end up back at l2_1. So after handling p2, we can use t2 to handle p1. Or maybe handle p1 first. Let's see.

p1 is at l2_3. To get to l2_4. So drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_3, load p1, drive to l2_4, unload. So steps:

- drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
- loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
- drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
- unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

But t2 is also needed for moving p2. So the plan would need to sequence these actions. However, since both packages are in c2, and t2 is in c2, it's possible to handle both with t2.

So the plan would be:

First handle p2:

1. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_5.
2. Load p2 into t2 at l2_5.
3. Drive t2 back to l2_1.
4. Unload p2 at l2_1. (Now p2 is at l2_1, meeting the goal.)

Then handle p1:

5. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_3.
6. Load p1 into t2 at l2_3.
7. Drive t2 to l2_4.
8. Unload p1 at l2_4.

That's 8 actions. But let's check if that meets all constraints. The constraint is that when p2 is in l2_1, there must have been a prior state where p2 was in l1_4 or p1 in l2_5. In this plan, p2 is moved to l2_1 in step 4. The prior state before that (step 3) would have p2 in t2, which was moving from l2_5 to l2_1. But the initial state has p2 in l2_5, so the earliest state (step 0) has p2 in l2_5, which satisfies the condition. Therefore, this plan meets the constraints.

But wait, the constraint says "if p2 is in l2_1 in some state, then there must be an earlier state where p2 was in l1_4 or p1 in l2_5." In the initial state, p2 is in l2_5, which is one of the conditions (p1 in l2_5? No, p2 in l2_5. Wait, the condition is "At least one of the following conditions is true: p2 is in l1_4 OR p1 is in l2_5." So the initial state has p2 in l2_5, which is not one of the options. Wait, the constraint says: "Package p2 is in location l1_4" OR "Package p1 is in location l2_5". Wait, in the initial state, p1 is in l2_3, p2 is in l2_5. So neither of the two conditions (p2 in l1_4 or p1 in l2_5) is true. Therefore, the initial state does not satisfy the condition. Oh, this is a problem.

So the constraint says that whenever p2 is in l2_1 (like in the final state), there must be an earlier state where either p2 was in l1_4 or p1 was in l2_5. But in the initial state, p1 is in l2_3 and p2 is in l2_5. So the initial state has neither of the required conditions. Therefore, if we move p2 to l2_1 directly via truck t2, then the constraint is violated because there's no prior state where p2 was in l1_4 or p1 in l2_5.

Wait, but the initial state is p2 in l2_5. So when we move p2 to l2_1, the prior state (during the plan) would have p2 in l2_5. But the constraint requires that in some earlier state, either p2 was in l1_4 or p1 in l2_5. The initial state has p2 in l2_5, but the constraint is that in the earlier state, p1 was in l2_5. Wait, the condition is "Package p1 is in location l2_5". But in the initial state, p1 is in l2_3. So the initial state does not meet that. Therefore, the problem arises: moving p2 to l2_1 would require that at some point before, p2 was in l1_4 or p1 was in l2_5. Since neither is true initially, we need to create a state where either p2 is in l1_4 or p1 is in l2_5.

So the plan must include moving p2 to l1_4 or moving p1 to l2_5 before moving p2 to l2_1. However, the goal requires p1 to be in l2_4 and p2 in l2_1. So if we move p1 to l2_5, that's not part of the goal. So perhaps the solution is to first move p2 to l1_4 (using airplanes), then move it back to l2_1. But how?

Alternatively, move p1 to l2_5. Let's explore that. Let's see:

Suppose we move p1 from l2_3 to l2_5. Then, when we move p2 to l2_1, the earlier state where p1 is in l2_5 would satisfy the constraint. Then, after moving p2 to l2_1, we can move p1 from l2_5 to l2_4. But this adds steps.

But how to move p1 to l2_5. Since p1 is in l2_3 (c2), truck t2 can be used. So steps:

1. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_3.
2. Load p1 into t2.
3. Drive t2 to l2_5.
4. Unload p1 at l2_5. Now p1 is in l2_5.

Then, handle p2:

5. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_5 (wait, no. After step 4, t2 is at l2_5. So load p2 into t2 (since p2 is there).

Wait, after step 4, t2 is at l2_5. So p2 is at l2_5. So steps:

5. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
6. Drive t2 to l2_1.
7. Unload p2 at l2_1.

Now, after step 4, p1 is at l2_5. So when moving p2 to l2_1 (step 7), there was an earlier state (step 4) where p1 was in l2_5. So the constraint is satisfied.

Then, move p1 back to l2_4:

8. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_5 (but wait, after step 7, t2 is at l2_1. To get p1 from l2_5 to l2_4, need to:

Wait, p1 is at l2_5 after step 4. We need to move it to l2_4. So:

8. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_5 (again)
9. Load p1 into t2
10. Drive to l2_4
11. Unload p1.

That's a lot of steps. Let's count:

Steps 1-11: 11 actions.

But maybe there's a better way. Let's think again.

Alternative approach: Use airplane to move p2 to l1_4, then bring it back. But l1_4 is in c1, which is a different city. To move p2 from c2 to c1, you need an airplane. Let's see.

Airplane a2 is at l2_1 (c2). So:

1. Load p2 into a2 at l2_1. But wait, p2 is at l2_5. So first, need to get p2 to l2_1.

So first, use truck t2 to move p2 to l2_1:

But if we do that, then the constraint requires that before p2 is in l2_1 (step of unloading), there was a state where p2 was in l1_4 or p1 in l2_5. But if we move p2 to l2_1 directly, then we need to have a prior state where one of those is true. However, the initial state doesn't have that. So maybe we first move p2 via airplane to l1_4, then bring it back. Let's try:

Move p2 to l1_4:

- Use truck t2 to move p2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (but again, this triggers the constraint issue). Alternatively, use airplane.

Wait, airplanes can fly between airports. Airports are l1_1 (c1) and l2_1 (c2). So a2 is at l2_1.

To move p2 to l1_4, which is in c1. So:

First, load p2 into a2 at l2_1. But p2 is in l2_5. So need to get p2 to l2_1 first. So:

1. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_5.
2. Load p2 into t2.
3. Drive back to l2_1.
4. Unload p2 at l2_1. Now p2 is at l2_1. But now, when we unload, the constraint is that before this, there must be a prior state with p2 in l1_4 or p1 in l2_5. But neither is true. So we can't do this. Therefore, this approach violates the constraint.

Alternative approach: Move p2 to l1_4 via airplane. So steps:

But p2 is in l2_5 (c2). How to get it to l1_4 (c1). 

Steps:

- Use truck t2 to move p2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (c2's airport).
- Load p2 into airplane a2.
- Fly a2 to l1_1 (c1's airport).
- Unload p2 at l1_1.
- Use truck t1 (in l1_4) to drive to l1_1, load p2, drive to l1_4, unload. Then p2 is in l1_4.
- Now, to bring p2 back to l2_1 (goal), load onto airplane a1 (at l1_1), fly to l2_1, unload.

But this requires a lot of steps. Also, during this process, when p2 is moved to l2_1 in the end, the prior state would have p2 in l1_4, satisfying the constraint.

So let's outline this:

For p2:

1. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_5 (c2).
2. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5.
3. Drive t2 back to l2_1.
4. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1. (Now p2 is at l2_1, but this violates the constraint unless we have a prior state where p2 was in l1_4 or p1 in l2_5. So this is a problem.)

So we can't do that. So instead, we need to first get p2 to l1_4 or p1 to l2_5.

Option: Move p1 to l2_5.

Steps for p1:

- Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_3.
- Load p1 into t2.
- Drive to l2_5.
- Unload p1. Now p1 is in l2_5. This satisfies the constraint when p2 is later moved to l2_1.

Then, handle p2:

- Drive t2 to l2_5 (already there after unloading p1).
- Load p2 into t2.
- Drive to l2_1.
- Unload p2. Now, since in a previous state (after step 4), p1 was in l2_5, the constraint is satisfied.

Then, move p1 from l2_5 to l2_4:

- Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_5.
- Load p1 into t2.
- Drive to l2_4.
- Unload p1.

Total steps: 4 (for p1) + 4 (for p2) + 3 (for p1 again) = 11 actions.

Alternatively, see if there's a more optimal way. Let's think.

After moving p1 to l2_5 (steps 1-4), then handle p2 (steps 5-8), then handle p1 (9-11). That's 11 steps. But maybe there's a way to combine steps.

But let's check if this satisfies all constraints. When p2 is unloaded at l2_1 (step 8), the prior state where p1 was in l2_5 is step 4. So the constraint is met.

Another approach: Use airplanes for cross-city transport. But since the goal is within c2, maybe it's not necessary, but perhaps using airplanes can help with the constraint.

Alternatively, move p2 to l1_4 via airplane, then move it back. Let's try:

1. Move p2 from l2_5 to l2_1 via truck t2.

But this would require steps 1-4 as before, which violate the constraint unless we first have p1 in l2_5 or p2 in l1_4. So we need to first move p1 to l2_5 or p2 to l1_4.

Let's try moving p2 to l1_4:

Steps:

a. Use truck t2 to move p2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (but this would require steps 1-4, which again violates unless we have the prior state.

Wait, I'm going in circles. Let's focus on the correct approach: to satisfy the constraint, during the plan's execution, when p2 is in l2_1 (final state), there must have been a prior state where either p2 was in l1_4 or p1 was in l2_5. Since the initial state doesn't have either, the plan must create such a state.

The simplest way is to move p1 to l2_5 first. Once p1 is in l2_5, then moving p2 to l2_1 is allowed.

So steps:

1. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_3 (current location of p1).
2. Load p1 into t2.
3. Drive t2 to l2_5.
4. Unload p1. Now p1 is in l2_5.

Now, we have a state where p1 is in l2_5. Then, we can proceed to move p2:

5. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_5 (no movement needed, already there).
6. Load p2 into t2.
7. Drive t2 to l2_1.
8. Unload p2. Now p2 is at l2_1. At this point, the constraint is satisfied because in step 4, p1 was in l2_5.

Now, move p1 from l2_5 to l2_4:

9. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_5.
10. Load p1 into t2.
11. Drive t2 to l2_4.
12. Unload p1.

This gives us 12 actions. But maybe there's a more optimal way. For example, after step 4, t2 is at l2_5 with p1 unloaded. So steps 5-8 can be:

5. Load p2 into t2 at l2_5.
6. Drive t2 to l2_1.
7. Unload p2.

Then steps for p1:

8. Drive t2 back to l2_5 (but after step 7, t2 is at l2_1). So steps:

8. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_5.
9. Load p1.
10. Drive to l2_4.
11. Unload.

Total steps: 11. So the steps are:

1. Drive t2 to l2_3.
2. Load p1.
3. Drive to l2_5.
4. Unload p1.
5. Load p2.
6. Drive to l2_1.
7. Unload p2.
8. Drive to l2_5.
9. Load p1.
10. Drive to l2_4.
11. Unload p1.

That's 11 actions. But is this the optimal? Let's see if any steps can be merged or optimized.

Alternatively, after moving p1 to l2_5, then move p2 and then move p1 in a single trip.

Wait, after step 4, t2 is at l2_5 with p1 unloaded. Then, steps 5-7: load p2, drive to l2_1, unload. Then t2 is at l2_1. To move p1 from l2_5 to l2_4, t2 needs to go back to l2_5, load p1, drive to l2_4. So steps 8-10.

But perhaps there's a way to move p1 and p2 together. But trucks can carry multiple packages, but the actions are per package. Assuming each load/unload is for a single package.

Alternatively, after step 7 (p2 is at l2_1), t2 is at l2_1. So to move p1 from l2_5 to l2_4:

8. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_5.
9. Load p1.
10. Drive to l2_4.
11. Unload.

Yes, that's 4 more steps (steps 8-11), making total 11 actions.

So the plan is 11 steps. But can we find a shorter plan? Let's see.

Wait, maybe after moving p1 to l2_5 (step 4), we can use t2 to first move p1 to l2_4 before moving p2. But the goal requires p1 to be at l2_4 and p2 at l2_1. So after step 4, p1 is at l2_5. So steps could be:

5. Load p1 into t2.
6. Drive to l2_4.
7. Unload p1. (Now p1 is at goal.)

Then handle p2:

8. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_5.
9. Load p2.
10. Drive to l2_1.
11. Unload p2.

This would be 11 steps as well. But maybe more efficient? No, same number.

But wait, after step 4 (p1 in l2_5), t2 is at l2_5. So steps:

5. Load p1 into t2.
6. Drive to l2_4.
7. Unload p1. (Now p1 is done.)
8. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_5.
9. Load p2.
10. Drive to l2_1.
11. Unload p2.

Total steps: 11. Same count.

But perhaps the initial approach of moving p2 first then p1 would be shorter, but the constraint complicates it.

Alternatively, use airplanes to move p2 to l1_4 and back, but that may take more steps.

For example:

1. Drive t2 to l2_5.
2. Load p2.
3. Drive to l2_1.
4. Unload p2. (But this requires prior state with p2 in l1_4 or p1 in l2_5. Not satisfied. So invalid.)

So no, this approach is invalid.

Thus, the only way to satisfy the constraint is to first move p1 to l2_5, then move p2 to l2_1, then move p1 to l2_4. This results in 11 actions.

But the problem states to provide an optimal plan with the least number of actions. Is there a shorter way?

Wait, maybe after moving p1 to l2_5, we can move both p1 and p2 in the same trip. For example:

After step 4 (p1 at l2_5, t2 at l2_5):

5. Load p1 into t2.
6. Load p2 into t2. (But each load action is per package. So two separate actions: steps 5 and 6.

Then drive to l2_4, unload p1 (step 7), then drive to l2_1, unload p2 (step 8). But how?

Wait, after loading both packages:

5. Load p1 into t2.
6. Load p2 into t2.
7. Drive to l2_4.
8. Unload p1.
9. Drive to l2_1.
10. Unload p2.

That's 6 steps after step 4, totaling 10 actions (steps 1-4, 5-10). But can you load two packages in one action? The actions are per package. Each load is for one package. So steps 5 and 6 are separate.

So steps:

1. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_3 (p1's initial location).
2. Load p1.
3. Drive to l2_5.
4. Unload p1. Now p1 is in l2_5.
5. Load p1 into t2 again. (But why? Because after unloading, t2 is empty.)
Wait, after step 4, t2 is at l2_5, empty. Then we need to load p2 into t2. But p2 is already at l2_5. So:

5. Load p2 into t2 at l2_5.
6. Drive to l2_1.
7. Unload p2. Now p2 is at l2_1. Constraint satisfied because step 4 had p1 at l2_5.
8. Drive t2 back to l2_5.
9. Load p1.
10. Drive to l2_4.
11. Unload p1.

That's 11 steps again.

Alternatively, after step 4, load p2 into t2, drive to l2_1, unload p2 (steps 5-7). Then drive back to l2_5, load p1, drive to l2_4, unload (steps 8-10). Total steps: 10. Wait:

1. Drive t2 l2_1 -> l2_3 (action 1)
2. load p1 (action 2)
3. drive to l2_5 (action 3)
4. unload p1 (action 4)
5. load p2 (action 5)
6. drive to l2_1 (action 6)
7. unload p2 (action 7)
8. drive to l2_5 (action 8)
9. load p1 (action 9)
10. drive to l2_4 (action 10)
11. unload p1 (action 11)

Still 11 actions.

Is there a way to avoid the back-and-forth? For example, after step 7 (p2 at l2_1), can we use a different truck or airplane to move p1? But the other truck is t1 in l1_4 (c1), which is in a different city. So it's not usable for packages in c2.

Airplanes can only move between airports. So to move p1 from l2_5 to l2_4 via airplane:

- Load p1 into airplane a2 at l2_1, but p1 is at l2_5. So need to move p1 to l2_1 first.

But moving p1 to l2_1 would require truck t2 to move it, which would be the same steps as before. So no gain.

Alternatively, use airplane a2 to fly to l2_5? But airports are l2_1, other locations are not airports. Airplanes can only be at airports. So airplane a2 can't land at l2_5. So no.

Thus, the only way is to use truck t2 for all movements in c2.

Therefore, the minimal plan is 11 actions. But wait, the problem asks for an optimal plan with the least number of actions. Is 11 the minimum, or can we do better?

Wait, another idea: After moving p1 to l2_5 (step 4), t2 is at l2_5. Load both p1 and p2 into t2, then drive to l2_4, unload p1, then drive to l2_1, unload p2. But this requires:

Steps:

1. Drive t2 to l2_3.
2. Load p1.
3. Drive to l2_5.
4. Unload p1.
5. Load p1 into t2. (Why? Because after step 4, p1 is at l2_5, t2 is there. So load p1 to move it again.)
6. Load p2 into t2.
7. Drive to l2_4.
8. Unload p1.
9. Drive to l2_1.
10. Unload p2.

But steps 5 and 6 are separate. So that's 10 actions. But this would be:

Action 1: drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
Action 2: loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
Action 3: drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2
Action 4: unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
Action 5: loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
Action 6: loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
Action 7: drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2
Action 8: unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
Action 9: drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
Action 10: unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

This is 10 actions. Does this work?

After action 4, p1 is at l2_5. Then action 5 loads p1 into t2, action 6 loads p2 into t2. Then drive to l2_4 (action7), unload p1 (action8). Then drive to l2_1 (action9), unload p2 (action10).

This would achieve both goals. Let's check the constraints:

When p2 is unloaded at l2_1 (action10), the prior states include action4 where p1 was in l2_5. So the constraint is satisfied.

So this plan has 10 actions. That's better than the previous 11. But is this valid?

Wait, can you load two packages into the truck in two separate actions? Yes. Each load action is for one package. So after unloading p1 at l2_5 (action4), t2 is empty. Then, actions5 and 6 load p1 and p2 into t2. Then drive to l2_4, unload p1 (action8), drive to l2_1, unload p2 (action10).

Yes. This works.

So this plan is 10 actions. Let's verify each step:

1. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_3. (OK)
2. Load p1 (OK, since t2 is at l2_3 and p1 is there).
3. Drive to l2_5. (OK, same city)
4. Unload p1. Now p1 is at l2_5. (OK)
5. Load p1 into t2. (OK, both at l2_5)
6. Load p2 into t2. (OK, p2 is at l2_5)
7. Drive to l2_4. (OK)
8. Unload p1. Now p1 is at l2_4 (goal met)
9. Drive to l2_1. (OK)
10. Unload p2. Now p2 is at l2_1 (goal met)

This plan has 10 actions. This is better than 11. So this is the optimal plan.

But wait, when you unload p1 in action8, then p2 is still in the truck. Then when you drive to l2_1 and unload p2, that's correct. Yes.

But wait, when you drive from l2_4 to l2_1, which are both in c2. The drivetruck action allows that, since they are in the same city.

Yes. So this plan is valid and has 10 actions. This seems better.

So the steps are:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
3. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
5. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
6. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
7. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2
8. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
9. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
10. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

This meets all requirements. The constraint is satisfied because when p2 is unloaded at l2_1 (action10), there was a prior state (action4) where p1 was in l2_5.

Yes. This plan is valid and optimal with 10 actions.
