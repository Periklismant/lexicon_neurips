Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. Hmm, the goal is to get p1 to l1_8 and p2 to l1_7. Let me first look at where everything starts.

Original state:
- p1 is in l2_7 (city c2)
- p2 is in l1_6 (city c1)
- Trucks t1 is in l1_8 (c1), t2 in l2_5 (c2)
- Airplanes a1 in l1_1 (c1's airport), a2 in l2_1 (c2's airport)

Constraints:
1. At some point, p1 must be in a2.
2. If p1 is in a2, then either p2 is in a2 or p1 is in a1 must hold at that state or later.

So first, need to move p1 from l2_7 to l1_8. Since l2_7 is in c2, maybe use truck t2 to get it to the airport l2_1, then load onto a2, fly to c1's airport l1_1, unload, then use truck t1 to take it to l1_8. But wait, t1 is already in l1_8. So maybe drive t1 to l1_1 first? Wait, t1 is in l1_8. Let me check.

Wait, the original state says "Package t1 is in location l1_8". Wait, no, t1 is a truck. Oh, wait, maybe that's a typo. Let me recheck the original state:

Looking back: "Package t1 is in location l1_8". Wait, that can't be right. Because t1 is a truck, not a package. The user must have made a mistake here. Because the objects listed include "truck t1", "truck t2", so they are trucks. But in the original state, it says "Package t1 is in location l1_8". That's probably an error. Maybe it should be "Truck t1 is in location l1_8". Otherwise, the problem is impossible because trucks can't be loaded if they are packages. So assuming that's a typo, the correct initial state is:

- Truck t1 is in l1_8 (c1)
- Truck t2 is in l2_5 (c2)
- Airplanes a1 in l1_1 (c1), a2 in l2_1 (c2)
- Packages p1 in l2_7 (c2), p2 in l1_6 (c1), and other packages (like t1, t2 as packages?) but that seems conflicting. Wait, the user provided the original state as:

Original state:
"Package t1 is in location l1_8"
"Package t2 is in location l2_5"
"Package p1 is in location l2_7"
"Package p2 is in location l1_6"
"Package a1 is in location l1_1"
"Package a2 is in location l2_1"

Wait, that can't be right. Because a1 and a2 are airplanes, not packages. So there's a mistake here. The initial state lists a1 and a2 as packages, but they are airplanes. This must be a typo. The correct initial state should have the trucks and airplanes in their locations, not as packages. So perhaps the user made a mistake, and the actual initial positions are:

- Truck t1 is in l1_8
- Truck t2 is in l2_5
- Airplane a1 is in l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in l2_1

But according to the user's original state, they are listed as packages. That's conflicting. Wait, maybe it's a formatting error. Let me re-examine the problem statement's "original state":

The original state of the world is the following:
	"Location l1_1 is in city c1"
	... (other locations)
	"Package t1 is in location l1_8"
	"Package t2 is in location l2_5"
	"Package p1 is in location l2_7"
	"Package p2 is in location l1_6"
	"Package a1 is in location l1_1"
	"Package a2 is in location l2_1"

Ah, here's the problem. The user incorrectly listed trucks and airplanes as packages. So according to the problem statement, t1, t2 are trucks, but in the initial state, they're listed as packages. Similarly, a1 and a2 are airplanes, but listed as packages. This is a contradiction. However, since the problem is given as such, maybe it's a typo, and the intended initial state is:

- Truck t1 is at l1_8
- Truck t2 is at l2_5
- Airplane a1 is at l1_1
- Airplane a2 is at l2_1

But the problem states them as packages. That's a problem. Because if t1 is a package, then we can't load it into a truck. So this must be a mistake. Assuming that the correct initial state is that the trucks and airplanes are in their respective locations, not as packages. Otherwise, the problem is impossible. So perhaps the user intended:

- Truck t1 is in l1_8
- Truck t2 is in l2_5
- Airplane a1 is in l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in l2_1

And the packages p1, p2 are in their locations as given. So proceeding with that assumption.

So, p1 is in l2_7 (c2), needs to go to l1_8 (c1). To move between cities, we need to use airplanes. So p1 must go from l2_7 to l2_1 (airport of c2), then fly to l1_1 (airport of c1), then to l1_8.

Similarly, p2 is in l1_6 (c1), needs to go to l1_7. Since both are in c1, can use truck t1. But t1 is in l1_8. So need to drive t1 from l1_8 to l1_6, load p2, then drive to l1_7, unload.

But first, handle the constraints. The first constraint is that p1 must be in a2 at some state. So during the plan, we need to load p1 into a2. The second constraint says that if p1 is in a2 in some state s, then either p2 is in a2 or p1 is in a1 must hold in s or after.

So when we load p1 into a2, we need to ensure that either after that, p2 is loaded into a2, or p1 is moved to a1. Let's think.

The plan for p1: from l2_7 to l2_1 (using truck t2 in c2), load into a2, fly to l1_1, unload, then load into truck t1 (but t1 is in l1_8, so need to drive t1 to l1_1? Wait, t1 is in l1_8. So steps for p1:

1. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_7 (c2) to pick up p1.

But wait, initial position of t2 is l2_5. So:

- Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_7. But l2_7 is in c2, so that's allowed. Then load p1 into t2.

Wait, but p1 is in l2_7. So steps:

Action: drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_7 c2

Then load p1 into t2:

loadtruck p1 t2 l2_7

Then drive t2 to l2_1 (the airport of c2):

drivetruck t2 l2_7 l2_1 c2

Then unload p1 at l2_1:

unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

Now, p1 is in l2_1. Then load into a2:

loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

Now, here's where the first constraint is met: p1 is in a2. Then, according to the second constraint, either p2 must be in a2 or p1 must be in a1 at that state or after.

So after loading p1 into a2, we need to ensure that either p2 is loaded into a2, or p1 is loaded into a1.

But the goal is to get p1 to l1_8, which is in c1. So after loading p1 into a2, fly a2 to l1_1 (c1's airport). Then unload p1 at l1_1. Then load p1 into a1? But why? Because the constraint says that if p1 is in a2, then in that state or later, either p2 is in a2 or p1 is in a1.

Wait, when p1 is loaded into a2, the state after that action is p1 in a2. So at that state, we need to check the constraint. The constraint requires that either p2 is in a2 or p1 is in a1 in that state (s) or in some state after s.

So during the plan, after loading p1 into a2 (state s), we must have at some point after (or in s) that p2 is in a2 or p1 is in a1.

But how can we satisfy that?

Option 1: After loading p1 into a2, fly a2 to l1_1, unload p1 (so p1 is in l1_1). Then load p1 into a1. Then fly a1 to l1_8's airport? Wait, l1_8 is a regular location, not an airport. The airport in c1 is l1_1. So to get p1 to l1_8, we need to use a truck. So after unloading p1 from a2 into l1_1, load it into a truck (t1) which is in l1_8. So we need to move t1 to l1_1 first.

Wait, initial position of t1 is l1_8. So to load p1 into t1, t1 needs to be in l1_1. So drive t1 from l1_8 to l1_1. Then load p1 into t1, then drive to l1_8 and unload.

But this is getting complicated. Let me outline the steps for p1:

1. Move p1 from l2_7 to l2_1 using t2.

   a. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_7.

   b. Load p1 into t2 at l2_7.

   c. Drive t2 to l2_1.

   d. Unload p1 at l2_1.

2. Load p1 into a2 at l2_1. Now, constraint is met here (p1 in a2). So after this step, we need to ensure that either p2 is in a2 or p1 is in a1 at some point.

3. Fly a2 to l1_1.

4. Unload p1 from a2 into l1_1.

Now, to satisfy the constraint: after step 2 (p1 in a2), we need to have either p2 in a2 or p1 in a1 at some point. Since p1 is unloaded from a2 in step 4, after that, p1 is in l1_1, not in a1. So unless we load p1 into a1, which is in l1_1. Let's consider:

After unloading p1 at l1_1 (step 4), load p1 into a1. Then fly a1 somewhere? But a1 is already at l1_1. Wait, but maybe not needed. Let's see:

If after step 2, we fly a2 to l1_1, unload p1 (step4), then load p1 into a1. Then, since a1 is in l1_1, we can load p1 into it. Then, to move p1 to l1_8, we unload from a1 into l1_1, then use t1 to take it to l1_8. Wait, but that's redundant. Alternatively, after loading into a1, fly a1 to l1_8? No, because l1_8 is not an airport. Airplanes can only fly between airports. So airports are l1_1 and l2_1. So a1 can't fly to l1_8. So to get p1 from l1_1 to l1_8, we have to use a truck.

So, steps after step4:

5. Load p1 into a1 at l1_1. Now, p1 is in a1. This would satisfy the constraint because after step2 (p1 in a2), in a later state (step5), p1 is in a1. So that satisfies the second constraint.

Then, unload p1 from a1 back to l1_1, and proceed to truck it to l1_8. But that seems inefficient. Alternatively, maybe after step4, drive t1 to l1_1, load p1 into t1, drive to l1_8, unload.

But then, when do we handle the constraint? Let's check:

After step2 (loading p1 into a2), the constraint requires that in that state or later, p2 is in a2 or p1 is in a1. So in step5, if we load p1 into a1, then that's sufficient.

So the plan would be:

For p1:

Steps 1-4 as above.

5. Load p1 into a1 (at l1_1).

6. Then unload p1 from a1 to l1_1 again (not helpful), but perhaps not necessary. Alternatively, after loading into a1, fly a1 to another airport? But maybe not needed. The important thing is that after step2, we have step5 where p1 is in a1, satisfying the constraint.

But then, how does p1 get to l1_8? After step4, p1 is in l1_1. We need to get it to l1_8 via truck.

So:

After step4, p1 is in l1_1.

Then, drive t1 from l1_8 to l1_1 (c1):

Action: drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_1 c1

Then load p1 into t1:

loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

Then drive t1 to l1_8:

drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_8 c1

Then unload p1:

unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_8

So that's the path for p1.

But in between, after step2 (loading p1 into a2), we need to do step5 (loading into a1) to satisfy the constraint. Wait, but step5 comes after step4 (unloading from a2). So after step2, the constraint is triggered. So in the state after step2 (p1 in a2), we need to ensure that either p2 is in a2 or p1 is in a1 at some point after.

But step5 (loading p1 into a1) occurs after step4 (unloading from a2). So after step2, during the flight to l1_1, and unloading, then loading into a1. So the constraint is satisfied because after step2, in a later state (step5), p1 is in a1.

So that works.

Now for p2: needs to go from l1_6 to l1_7. Both in c1. So use truck t1, which is initially in l1_8. So steps:

1. Drive t1 from l1_8 to l1_6.

But wait, in the p1 plan, we have to drive t1 from l1_8 to l1_1, then back to l1_8. But for p2, we need to drive t1 to l1_6. So need to interleave these steps.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let's outline the entire plan step by step, considering both packages and the constraints.

Let me start from the beginning.

Plan for p1:

1. In c2, drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_7.

2. Load p1 into t2 at l2_7.

3. Drive t2 to l2_1.

4. Unload p1 at l2_1.

5. Load p1 into a2 at l2_1. (Now, constraint1 is met here.)

6. Fly a2 to l1_1.

7. Unload p1 from a2 into l1_1.

8. Drive t1 from l1_8 to l1_1.

9. Load p1 into t1.

10. Drive t1 back to l1_8.

11. Unload p1 at l1_8.

For the constraint: after step5 (p1 in a2), need to have p2 in a2 or p1 in a1 at some later state.

So after step5, we have:

Step5: p1 in a2.

Then step6: fly a2 to l1_1.

Step7: unload p1 into l1_1.

Step8: drive t1 to l1_1.

Step9: load p1 into t1.

Step10: drive t1 to l1_8.

Step11: unload p1.

But during these steps, when do we get p1 into a1? Step5 requires that after step5, either p2 is in a2 or p1 is in a1. Since p1 is unloaded into l1_1 in step7, and then loaded into t1, not into a1. So unless we load p1 into a1 after step7.

So after step7, p1 is in l1_1. a1 is at l1_1. So we can load p1 into a1.

So insert after step7:

7a. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

Then, unload from a1 back to l1_1 (but that's redundant). But the constraint is satisfied because after step5, in step7a, p1 is in a1. So this would satisfy the second constraint.

But then, after loading into a1, we need to unload again, which adds steps, but it's necessary for the constraint.

Alternatively, after step7, load p1 into a1, then unload, then load into t1. But that adds steps. However, it's necessary to meet the constraint.

So revised steps for p1:

7. Unload p1 from a2 into l1_1.

7a. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (now p1 is in a1)

7b. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (p1 back to l1_1)

Then proceed with steps 8-11 as before.

But this adds two more steps. However, this way, after step5 (p1 in a2), in step7a, p1 is in a1, which satisfies the constraint.

But this makes the plan longer. Alternatively, after step7, can we load p1 into a1 and then fly it somewhere? But since the goal is to get p1 to l1_8, which is not an airport, we still need a truck. So perhaps it's better to have steps:

After step7 (p1 in l1_1):

7a. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (now in a1)

7b. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l1_1 (no movement, but perhaps not useful)

7c. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1.

But this doesn't help. So the only way to get p1 into a1 is to load it there, which requires it to be at l1_1. So step7a is needed.

Thus, the plan for p1 includes steps 7a and 7b (unload), but that's redundant. Alternatively, maybe after step7a, we can leave p1 in a1 and then unload it later. But since the goal is to have p1 in l1_8, which requires unloading from a truck.

Alternatively, after step7a (p1 in a1), fly a1 to another airport? But no need. The important thing is that after step5, p1 is in a1 at some point. So even if we leave it in a1, but then how to get it to l1_8. Maybe:

After step7a (p1 in a1), unload into l1_1 (step7b), then proceed to load into t1.

So steps:

7. Unload p1 from a2 to l1_1.

7a. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1.

7b. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1.

But this seems unnecessary. However, the constraint requires that after p1 is in a2 (step5), either p2 is in a2 or p1 is in a1 at some state after. So if we do step7a, then p1 is in a1, satisfying the constraint. Even if we then immediately unload it (step7b), it's still acceptable because the constraint is that it must hold at s or some state after. So step7a is the critical one.

Therefore, the steps would be:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_7 c2

2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_7

3. drivetruck t2 l2_7 l2_1 c2

4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

5. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

6. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

7. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

8. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

Now, after step5, p1 is in a2. Step8 loads p1 into a1, which satisfies the second constraint. Then we can proceed:

9. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

10. drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_1 c1

11. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

12. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_8 c1

13. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_8

Now, p1 is at l1_8 as required.

For p2: starts in l1_6 (c1), needs to go to l1_7. Use truck t1, which is initially at l1_8. But in the steps above, t1 is used for p1. So need to interleave the steps.

Wait, the steps for p1 require driving t1 from l1_8 to l1_1 (step10), then back to l1_8 (step12). For p2, we need to use t1 to move p2 from l1_6 to l1_7. So perhaps we can do that before using t1 for p1.

But the timing must be such that after t1 is driven to l1_1 for p1, it can't be used for p2 until it's back. But that would complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps use truck t1 for p2 first.

Wait, initial positions:

t1 is in l1_8.

p2 is in l1_6.

To move p2 to l1_7, steps would be:

A. drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_6 c1

B. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_6

C. drivetruck t1 l1_6 l1_7 c1

D. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_7

But if we do this before moving t1 to l1_1 for p1, then after step D, t1 is in l1_7. Then, for p1, we need to drive t1 from l1_7 to l1_1. But can trucks move between any locations in the same city? Yes. So:

So the overall plan would need to interleave the steps for p1 and p2.

But let's outline:

For p2:

A. Drive t1 from l1_8 to l1_6.

B. Load p2 into t1.

C. Drive t1 to l1_7.

D. Unload p2.

Then, after that, use t1 for p1's transport:

E. Drive t1 from l1_7 to l1_1.

F. Load p1 into t1.

G. Drive to l1_8.

H. Unload p1.

But in this case, when do we handle p1's steps?

Let's see:

The steps for p1 require:

1. Move p1 from l2_7 to l2_1 using t2.

2. Load into a2, fly to l1_1.

3. Load into a1 (for constraint), then into t1.

But if p2 is handled first, using t1 to move to l1_7, then t1 is in l1_7. Then, after unloading p2, drive t1 to l1_1 (step E), load p1, drive to l1_8.

This might work.

So combining both:

Plan steps:

For p2:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_6 c1

2. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_6

3. drivetruck t1 l1_6 l1_7 c1

4. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_7

For p1:

5. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_7 c2

6. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_7

7. drivetruck t2 l2_7 l2_1 c2

8. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

9. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

10. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

11. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

12. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1  (to satisfy constraint)

13. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

14. drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_1 c1 (move t1 from l1_7 to l1_1 after p2 is delivered)

15. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

16. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_8 c1

17. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_8

But wait, step14 requires t1 to be in l1_7, which it is after step4. So that's possible.

This plan would work for both packages.

Now, check the constraints:

- The first constraint: p1 must be in a2 at some state. That's step9 (load into a2), then step10 (fly), step11 (unload). So step9 is when p1 is in a2.

- The second constraint: if p1 is in a2 (step9), then in that state or later, either p2 is in a2 or p1 is in a1. 

After step9, the next step is fly a2 to l1_1 (step10), then unload (step11), then load into a1 (step12). So step12 is when p1 is in a1, which is after step9. Thus, the constraint is satisfied.

Additionally, check if any other steps involve a2 and p2. But p2 is in c1, and a2 is in c2 initially, then flies to c1. So after step10, a2 is in l1_1. Could we load p2 into a2? But p2 is in l1_7. To load p2 into a2, a2 must be in l1_7, but airplanes can only be at airports. l1_7 is not an airport (airports are l1_1 and l2_1). So p2 cannot be loaded into a2 unless a2 is at l1_1. But p2 is in l1_7, which is a different location. So that's not possible. Therefore, the only way to satisfy the constraint is to have p1 loaded into a1 after being in a2.

Thus, the plan includes step12 (load into a1), which meets the constraint.

Now, check if all steps are valid.

Let's go through each action:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_6 c1: Valid since t1 starts in l1_8, and both are in c1.

2. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_6: Valid since p2 and t1 are in l1_6 after step1.

3. drivetruck t1 l1_6 l1_7 c1: Valid.

4. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_7: Valid as t1 is in l1_7 and p2 is in t1.

5. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_7 c2: Valid, t2 starts in l2_5.

6. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_7: Valid.

7. drivetruck t2 l2_7 l2_1 c2: Valid.

8. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1: Valid.

9. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1: Valid, a2 is in l2_1 initially (assuming correction of initial state).

10. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1: Valid.

11. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1: Valid.

12. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1: Valid, a1 is in l1_1.

13. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1: Valid.

14. drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_1 c1: Valid, since after step4, t1 is in l1_7.

15. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1: Valid, p1 is in l1_1 after step13.

16. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_8 c1: Valid.

17. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_8: Valid.

This plan has 17 steps, but perhaps there's a shorter way.

Wait, steps12 and 13 (loading and unloading into a1) are only for satisfying the constraint. But after step11, p1 is in l1_1. If we can load p1 into a1 and then immediately unload, but that's redundant. However, it's necessary to have p1 in a1 at least once after step9.

Alternatively, after step11, load p1 into a1 (step12), then proceed to step14-17 without unloading. But step14 requires t1 to be in l1_7, which it is after step4. So steps would be:

After step11 (p1 in l1_1):

12. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (now in a1)

13. drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_1 c1 (t1 was left in l1_7 after step4)

14. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (wait, p1 is in a1, to load into truck, we need to unload from a1 to l1_1 first?)

Wait, to load p1 into t1, p1 must be in l1_1. If p1 is in a1, we need to unload it first.

So:

12. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

13. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (p1 back to l1_1)

14. drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_1 c1

15. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

16. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_8 c1

17. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_8

So steps12-17 as before.

But maybe there's a way to avoid steps12 and 13 by using a different approach to satisfy the constraint.

Alternatively, after step9 (p1 in a2), can we load p2 into a2? But p2 is in l1_6 (c1), and a2 is in l2_1 (c2). So impossible unless a2 is flown to c1's airport l1_1, but that happens in step10. So after step10, a2 is in l1_1. Then, to load p2 into a2, we need to get p2 to l1_1. But p2 is in l1_6. So drive t1 from l1_7 to l1_6, load p2, drive to l1_1, unload, then load into a2. But this adds many steps and makes the plan longer. Also, the constraint is to have p2 in a2 or p1 in a1 after step9. Loading p2 into a2 would satisfy it, but it's more steps.

So it's better to load p1 into a1, which requires fewer steps.

Thus, the initial plan seems valid.

Now, check if the plan is optimal. Are there any redundant steps?

For example, steps12 and 13 (loading into a1 and unloading) are necessary for the constraint but add two steps. Is there a way to avoid these?

Alternatively, after step9 (p1 in a2), fly a2 to l1_1 (step10), unload (step11), then load into a1 (step12), then fly a1 to another airport (but no need), then unload. But maybe not necessary. The important thing is that after step9, there's a step where p1 is in a1. So steps12 and 13 are needed.

But perhaps we can use a different approach. For instance, after step9, fly a2 to l1_1, then instead of unloading p1, transfer p1 from a2 to a1 directly. But the actions don't allow transferring between airplanes unless they are in the same location. So a2 and a1 must be in the same location. After step10, a2 is in l1_1, and a1 is also in l1_1. So both are in l1_1. So:

After step10, a2 is in l1_1. a1 is also there.

So steps:

10. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

11. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (p1 in l1_1)

12. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

Now, p1 is in a1. Then proceed to move to truck.

So steps12 is load into a1, then step13 is unload into l1_1 again (if needed), but maybe we can skip unloading and directly load into truck.

Wait, no. To load into truck, p1 must be in the same location as the truck. If p1 is in a1, then it's not in the location until unloaded. So steps must be:

12. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

13. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

14. drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_1 c1

15. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

16. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_8 c1

17. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_8

So steps12-13 are necessary.

Alternatively, could we leave p1 in a1 and fly a1 to another airport, but since the goal is l1_8, which is not an airport, we still need to use a truck. So no.

Thus, the plan is as outlined.

Now, check the number of steps. Are there any steps that can be merged or skipped?

For p2's steps:

1. Drive t1 to l1_6.

2. Load p2.

3. Drive to l1_7.

4. Unload.

That's 4 steps.

For p1:

5. Drive t2 to l2_7.

6. Load p1.

7. Drive to l2_1.

8. Unload.

9. Load into a2.

10. Fly to l1_1.

11. Unload.

12. Load into a1.

13. Unload.

14. Drive t1 to l1_1.

15. Load into t1.

16. Drive to l1_8.

17. Unload.

Total steps: 17.

Is there a shorter way?

For example, after step9 (load into a2), fly to l1_1 (step10), unload (step11), then load into truck t1 which is already in l1_1. Wait, but t1 was used for p2 and is in l1_7. So after step4, t1 is in l1_7. To load p1 into t1, need to drive t1 to l1_1. So steps14 (drive t1 from l1_7 to l1_1) is necessary.

So no way to avoid that.

Alternative approach: Could we use airplane a1 to carry p1 from l1_1 to some other airport, but since the destination is l1_8 (not an airport), it's not helpful. So no.

Another idea: After step11 (p1 in l1_1), instead of loading into a1, can we immediately drive t1 to l1_1 and load p1 into it? But t1 is in l1_7 after step4. So we need to drive it to l1_1, which requires steps14.

Thus, the plan as outlined is necessary.

But wait, after step4 (p2 delivered to l1_7), t1 is in l1_7. So to use t1 for p1, we need to drive it to l1_1 (step14), which is part of the plan.

Thus, the plan is optimal in terms of steps.

Therefore, the final plan is as follows.
