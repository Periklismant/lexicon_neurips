Alright, let me understand this logistics planning problem:

1. We have cities (c1, c2) with locations (l1_1 to l1_8 in c1, l2_1 to l2_8 in c2).
2. l1_1 and l2_1 are airports.
3. We have trucks (t1, t2), airplanes (a1, a2), and packages (p1, p2).
4. Trucks can only move within a city, while airplanes can fly between airports.
5. Packages can be loaded and unloaded from trucks and airplanes.

The initial state is:
- t1 is in location l1_8
- t2 is in location l2_5
- p1 is in location l2_7
- p2 is in location l1_6
- a1 is in location l1_1
- a2 is in location l2_1

The goal is to have:
- p1 in location l1_8
- p2 in location l1_7

There are two constraints:
1. p1 must be in a2 at some point in the plan.
2. If p1 is in a2 in some state s, then either p2 is in a2 or p1 is in a1 in state s or a later state.

Let's first think through a high-level plan:

Package p1 is in l2_7, and it needs to go to l1_8. Since it needs to be in a2 at some point, and a2 is in l2_1, we'll need to:
1. Move p1 from l2_7 to l2_1 using t2.
2. Load p1 onto a2.
3. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
4. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1.
5. Load p1 onto a truck in c1 (t1).
6. Drive t1 to l1_8.
7. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_8.

Package p2 is in l1_6, and it needs to go to l1_7. We can use t1 for this:
1. Drive t1 from wherever it is to l1_6.
2. Load p2 onto t1.
3. Drive t1 to l1_7.
4. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_7.

Now, we need to ensure the constraints are met:
1. p1 must be in a2 at some point - this is part of our plan.
2. If p1 is in a2, then either p2 is in a2 or p1 is in a1 at the same time or later. We have a few options:
   a. Move p2 to a2 before unloading p1 from a2.
   b. Move p1 to a1 after it's unloaded from a2.

Option a seems more complex, so let's go with option b.

Let's refine the steps:

1. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_7 in c2.
2. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_7.
3. Drive t2 from l2_7 to l2_1 in c2.
4. Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1.
5. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
6. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1.
7. Load p1 onto a1 at l1_1. (to satisfy the second constraint)

Now, let's continue with the plan to get p1 to l1_8:
8. Unload p1 from a1 at l1_1.
9. Drive t1 from l1_8 to l1_1 in c1.
10. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_1.
11. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_6 in c1.
12. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_6.
13. Drive t1 from l1_6 to l1_7 in c1.
14. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_7.
15. Drive t1 from l1_7 to l1_8 in c1.
16. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_8.

This plan should satisfy both the goal and the constraints.

However, there's an issue. It seems like in the initial state, I've interpreted some vehicles as packages. Let me re-read the description:

The initial state is:
- "Package t1 is in location l1_8"
- "Package t2 is in location l2_5"
- "Package p1 is in location l2_7"
- "Package p2 is in location l1_6"
- "Package a1 is in location l1_1"
- "Package a2 is in location l2_1"

This doesn't quite make sense because t1, t2, a1, and a2 are supposed to be trucks and airplanes, not packages. Let me revisit the problem description to clarify.

Ah, I see. It seems like there's some confusion in how the initial state is represented. t1, t2, a1, and a2 should refer to "truck" and "airplane" entities, not "package" entities.

Let me reinterpret the initial state as:

- Truck t1 is in location l1_8
- Truck t2 is in location l2_5
- Package p1 is in location l2_7
- Package p2 is in location l1_6
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (which is an airport)
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1 (which is an airport)

With this interpretation, the plan I outlined should still work, with minor adjustments to correctly use the entities as trucks, airplanes, and packages.

But let me redraft to ensure accuracy:

Initial state:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_8 (in city c1)
- Truck t2 is in location l2_5 (in city c2)
- Package p1 is in location l2_7 (in city c2)
- Package p2 is in location l1_6 (in city c1)
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (airport in city c1)
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1 (airport in city c2)

Goal:
- p1 in location l1_8
- p2 in location l1_7

Constraints:
1. p1 must be in a2 at some point.
2. If p1 is in a2 in some state s, then either p2 is in a2 or p1 is in a1 in state s or a later state.

Plan:
1. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_7 in c2.
2. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_7.
3. Drive t2 from l2_7 to l2_1 in c2.
4. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1.
5. Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1.
6. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
7. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1.
8. Load p1 onto a1 at l1_1. (to satisfy the second constraint)
9. Unload p1 from a1 at l1_1.
10. Drive t1 from l1_8 to l1_1 in c1.
11. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_1.
12. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_6 in c1.
13. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_6.
14. Drive t1 from l1_6 to l1_7 in c1.
15. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_7.
16. Drive t1 from l1_7 to l1_8 in c1.
17. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_8.

This plan should work, but let's review it again to make sure it's optimal.

I notice that steps 8 and 9 (loading p1 onto a1 and then unloading it) may not be necessary if I plan differently. Instead, I can satisfy the constraint by loading p2 onto a2 before unloading p1 from a2. Let's see if this can lead to a shorter plan.

Alternative Plan:
1. Drive t1 from l1_8 to l1_6 in c1.
2. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_6.
3. Drive t1 from l1_6 to l1_1 in c1.
4. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1.
5. Load p2 onto a2 at l1_1. (This requires a2 to fly to l1_1 first, but it's an extra step)

Actually, option a is becoming cumbersome as well. Let's rethink our approach. 

Let's first determine the shortest route for p1 from l2_7 to l1_8:
1. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_7 in c2.
2. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_7.
3. Drive t2 from l2_7 to l2_1 in c2.
4. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1.
5. Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1. (This satisfies the first constraint)
6. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
7. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1.
8. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_1. (This requires t1 to drive to l1_1 first)
9. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_8 in c1.
10. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_8.

For p2, the shortest route from l1_6 to l1_7 is:
1. Drive t1 from wherever it is to l1_6 in c1.
2. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_6.
3. Drive t1 from l1_6 to l1_7 in c1.
4. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_7.

To merge these plans, we need to decide when to handle p2 relative to p1. If p1 is in a2, then either p2 should be in a2 or p1 should be in a1. Let's opt for the simplest solution: after unloading p1 from a2, immediately load it onto a1, then immediately unload it from a1.

Combined Plan:
1. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_7 in c2.
2. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_7.
3. Drive t2 from l2_7 to l2_1 in c2.
4. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1.
5. Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1. (This satisfies the first constraint)
6. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
7. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1.
8. Load p1 onto a1 at l1_1. (This satisfies the second constraint)
9. Unload p1 from a1 at l1_1.
10. Drive t1 from l1_8 to l1_1 in c1.
11. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_1.
12. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_6 in c1.
13. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_6.
14. Drive t1 from l1_6 to l1_7 in c1.
15. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_7.
16. Drive t1 from l1_7 to l1_8 in c1.
17. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_8.

This plan should satisfy all constraints and be relatively efficient. But I think I can optimize it further.

Actually, while I'm loading and unloading p1 from a1, I can have t1 fetch p2 from l1_6, so that by the time I'm ready to load p1 onto t1, it already has p2.

Optimized Plan:
1. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_7 in c2.
2. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_7.
3. Drive t2 from l2_7 to l2_1 in c2.
4. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1.
5. Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1. (This satisfies the first constraint)
6. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
7. Drive t1 from l1_8 to l1_6 in c1.
8. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_6.
9. Drive t1 from l1_6 to l1_1 in c1.
10. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1.
11. Load p1 onto a1 at l1_1. (This satisfies the second constraint)
12. Unload p1 from a1 at l1_1.
13. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_1.
14. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_7 in c1.
15. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_7.
16. Drive t1 from l1_7 to l1_8 in c1.
17. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_8.

I think this is a more optimized plan. Let's double-check the constraints once more:

1. p1 must be in a2 at some point: Satisfied in step 5.
2. If p1 is in a2 in some state s, then either p2 is in a2 or p1 is in a1 in state s or a later state: p1 is in a2 from step 5 to step 10, and then p1 is in a1 from step 11 to step 12. So this constraint is also satisfied.

Wait, let me reconsider the constraint carefully. It says:

"If expression 'Package p1 is in a2' holds in some state s, then expression 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "Package p2 is in a2", "Package p1 is in a1"' must hold at s or at some state after s"

So, after p1 is in a2, at some later point (or at the same time), either p2 must be in a2 or p1 must be in a1. In my plan, p1 is in a1 after it's unloaded from a2, which should satisfy this constraint.

Actually, let me reconsider the constraint more carefully. The constraint states that if p1 is in a2 at some state s, then either p2 is in a2 or p1 is in a1 at state s or a later state. In my plan, p1 is in a2 from step 5 to step 10, and then p1 is in a1 from step 11 to step 12. So, the constraint is satisfied.

Let's consider one more optimization: can we eliminate the need to load p1 onto a1 and then immediately unload it?

The constraint requires that if p1 is in a2, then either p2 is in a2 or p1 is in a1 at some later point. If we load p2 onto a2 before unloading p1, we can satisfy the constraint without the extra step of using a1.

Let's see if this is feasible:
1. Drive t1 from l1_8 to l1_6 in c1.
2. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_6.
3. Drive t1 from l1_6 to l1_1 in c1.
4. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1.
5. Load p2 onto a2 at l1_1. (This requires a2 to fly to l1_1 first, which is an extra step)

This approach also adds extra steps. I think the plan where p1 is loaded onto a1 after being unloaded from a2 is the most efficient.

Actually, after thinking more about it, the constraint does not require p1 to be in a1 immediately after it is in a2. The constraint states that if p1 is in a2 at some state s, then either p2 is in a2 or p1 is in a1 at state s or a later state. So, as long as p1 is in a1 at some point after it's in a2, the constraint is satisfied.

Let's revise the plan to be more efficient:

1. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_7 in c2.
2. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_7.
3. Drive t2 from l2_7 to l2_1 in c2.
4. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1.
5. Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1. (This satisfies the first constraint)
6. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
7. Drive t1 from l1_8 to l1_6 in c1.
8. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_6.
9. Drive t1 from l1_6 to l1_7 in c1.
10. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_7. (This completes the goal for p2)
11. Drive t1 from l1_7 to l1_1 in c1.
12. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1.
13. Load p1 onto a1 at l1_1. (This satisfies the second constraint)
14. Unload p1 from a1 at l1_1.
15. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_1.
16. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_8 in c1.
17. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_8. (This completes the goal for p1)

However, it's still a bit convoluted that I'm loading p1 onto a1 and immediately unloading it. Let's see if there's a way to handle the second constraint differently.

We can handle the constraint directly by ensuring that if p1 is in a2, then either p2 is in a2 or p1 is eventually in a1. The simpler option is to move p1 to a1 after it's in a2.

Plan with Constraint Handling:
1. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_7 in c2.
2. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_7.
3. Drive t2 from l2_7 to l2_1 in c2.
4. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1.
5. Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1. (This satisfies the first constraint)
6. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
7. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1.
8. Load p1 onto a1 at l1_1. (This satisfies the second constraint)
9. Unload p1 from a1 at l1_1.
10. Drive t1 from l1_8 to l1_6 in c1.
11. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_6.
12. Drive t1 from l1_6 to l1_7 in c1.
13. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_7. (This completes the goal for p2)
14. Drive t1 from l1_7 to l1_1 in c1.
15. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_1.
16. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_8 in c1.
17. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_8. (This completes the goal for p1)

This plan might seem a bit inefficient because t1 makes multiple trips, but the constraint is driving some of this complexity. Let's double-check the plan for any errors or inefficiencies.

Actually, I've just realized that the operations of handling p1 and p2 are mostly independent, except for their shared use of t1. So, instead of having t1 make multiple trips, I can optimize the plan by minimizing the movements of t1.

One option is to use both trucks to move the packages more efficiently. For example, I can use t2 to move p1 from l2_7 to l2_1, and use t1 to move p2 from l1_6 to l1_7. The rest of the steps can be arranged to minimize the number of movements.

Optimized Plan with Both Trucks:
1. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_7 in c2.
2. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_7.
3. Drive t1 from l1_8 to l1_6 in c1.
4. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_6.
5. Drive t2 from l2_7 to l2_1 in c2.
6. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1.
7. Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1. (This satisfies the first constraint)
8. Drive t1 from l1_6 to l1_7 in c1.
9. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_7. (This completes the goal for p2)
10. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
11. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1.
12. Load p1 onto a1 at l1_1. (This satisfies the second constraint)
13. Unload p1 from a1 at l1_1.
14. Drive t1 from l1_7 to l1_1 in c1.
15. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_1.
16. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_8 in c1.
17. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_8. (This completes the goal for p1)

This plan still requires 17 actions, but it utilizes both trucks efficiently, and t1 doesn't need to make as many trips back and forth.

Actually, there's one more optimization I can make. Instead of having t1 move back to l1_1 from l1_7 after dropping off p2, I can have t1 move to l1_1 before dropping off p2, then load p1 onto t1, then drive t1 to l1_7 to drop off p2, and finally drive t1 to l1_8 to drop off p1. This way, t1 only needs to make one trip.

Optimized Plan with Fewer Trips:
1. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_7 in c2.
2. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_7.
3. Drive t2 from l2_7 to l2_1 in c2.
4. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1.
5. Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1. (This satisfies the first constraint)
6. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
7. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1.
8. Load p1 onto a1 at l1_1. (This satisfies the second constraint)
9. Unload p1 from a1 at l1_1.
10. Drive t1 from l1_8 to l1_6 in c1.
11. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_6.
12. Drive t1 from l1_6 to l1_1 in c1.
13. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_1.
14. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_7 in c1.
15. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_7. (This completes the goal for p2)
16. Drive t1 from l1_7 to l1_8 in c1.
17. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_8. (This completes the goal for p1)

This plan is more efficient in terms of the movements of t1. However, I'm still loading and immediately unloading p1 from a1. Let's see if there's a way to eliminate this inefficiency.

Actually, on further reflection, I think my plan is already quite efficient considering the given constraints. I believe there's little more that can be stripped away without violating some constraint. The only step that might seem inefficient is loading and immediately unloading p1 from a1, but this is required to satisfy the constraint.

Given the constraints and the initial state, I believe my plan is optimal in terms of minimizing the number of actions. Let's formalize it as required by the problem:

```
drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_7 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_7
drivetruck t2 l2_7 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_6 c1
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_6
drivetruck t1 l1_6 l1_1 c1
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_7 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_7
drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_8 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_8
```

But wait, I just realized there's an error in the action names. In the problem description, I see both "loadairplane" and "unloadairplane" as valid actions, but later in the list of actions, "loadairplane" is mentioned twice, and there's no mention of "unloadairplane". Let me double-check the problem description.

After double-checking, it looks like the "unloadairplane" action is just misspelled as "loadairplane" in the list of actions. The correct actions should be:
- "loadtruck p t l"
- "loadairplane p ap l"
- "unloadtruck p t l"
- "unloadairplane p ap l"
- "drivetruck t l_from l_to c"
- "flyairplane ap l_from l_to"

So, my plan should be updated:

```
drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_7 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_7
drivetruck t2 l2_7 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_6 c1
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_6
drivetruck t1 l1_6 l1_1 c1
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_7 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_7
drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_8 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_8
```

This should be the optimal plan given the constraints and the initial state.

Wait, I realized one more issue. When I read the initial state again, there is a mistake in how the objects are listed (and it's quite confusing).

Initial state:
- "Package t1 is in location l1_8"
- "Package t2 is in location l2_5"
- "Package p1 is in location l2_7"
- "Package p2 is in location l1_6"
- "Package a1 is in location l1_1"
- "Package a2 is in location l2_1"

But t1 and t2 are trucks, and a1 and a2 are airplanes, not packages. Let me reinterpret this:

- Truck t1 is in location l1_8
- Truck t2 is in location l2_5
- Package p1 is in location l2_7
- Package p2 is in location l1_6
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

With this interpretation, my plan remains valid. Let's double-check the preconditions for each action:

1. "drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_7 c2": t2 is in l2_5, and both l2_5 and l2_7 are in c2. Preconditions satisfied.
2. "loadtruck p1 t2 l2_7": p1 and t2 are both in l2_7. Preconditions satisfied.
3. "drivetruck t2 l2_7 l2_1 c2": t2 is in l2_7, and both l2_7 and l2_1 are in c2. Preconditions satisfied.
4. "unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1": p1 is in t2, and t2 is in l2_1. Preconditions satisfied.
5. "loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1": p1 and a2 are both in l2_1. Preconditions satisfied.
6. "flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1": a2 is in l2_1. Preconditions satisfied.
7. "unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1": p1 is in a2, and a2 is in l1_1. Preconditions satisfied.
8. "loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1": p1 and a1 are both in l1_1. Preconditions satisfied.
9. "unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1": p1 is in a1, and a1 is in l1_1. Preconditions satisfied.
10. "drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_6 c1": t1 is in l1_8, and both l1_8 and l1_6 are in c1. Preconditions satisfied.
11. "loadtruck p2 t1 l1_6": p2 and t1 are both in l1_6. Preconditions satisfied.
12. "drivetruck t1 l1_6 l1_1 c1": t1 is in l1_6, and both l1_6 and l1_1 are in c1. Preconditions satisfied.
13. "loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1": p1 and t1 are both in l1_1. Preconditions satisfied.
14. "drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_7 c1": t1 is in l1_1, and both l1_1 and l1_7 are in c1. Preconditions satisfied.
15. "unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_7": p2 is in t1, and t1 is in l1_7. Preconditions satisfied.
16. "drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_8 c1": t1 is in l1_7, and both l1_7 and l1_8 are in c1. Preconditions satisfied.
17. "unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_8": p1 is in t1, and t1 is in l1_8. Preconditions satisfied.

All preconditions are satisfied for each action. The plan is valid.

Let me check once more if there's a way to optimize and reduce the number of actions:

1. Do I need to load and unload p1 from a1? Yes, to satisfy the constraint: "If p1 is in a2, then either p2 is in a2 or p1 is in a1 at some point after." Since I'm not loading p2 onto a2, I need to load p1 onto a1 at some point after it's in a2.

2. Can I reduce the number of truck movements? Looking at the plan, I don't see any redundant movements. Each movement is required to either pick up or drop off a package.

3. Can I use a different strategy to satisfy the constraints? Another option would be to load p2 onto a2 after p1 is loaded onto a2, which would satisfy the constraint. But this would require additional steps to move p2 to a2 and then unload it.

I'm satisfied that my plan is optimal given the constraints and the initial state.

To summarize, here's the plan:
```
drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_7 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_7
drivetruck t2 l2_7 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_6 c1
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_6
drivetruck t1 l1_6 l1_1 c1
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_7 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_7
drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_8 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_8
```

This plan satisfies both the goal (having p1 in l1_8 and p2 in l1_7) and the constraints (p1 must be in a2 at some point, and if p1 is in a2, then either p2 is in a2 or p1 is in a1 at some point after).

On second thought, let me double-check if there's a more efficient way to sequence my steps to minimize the number of actions.

I think I can optimize one part of my plan. Since t1 is in l1_8, it doesn't make sense to first move it to l1_6, then to l1_1, just to move it back to l1_7 and l1_8. I could first move p1 into c1, and only then use t1 to move both p1 and p2 to their destinations.

Optimized Plan:
1. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_7 in c2.
2. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_7.
3. Drive t2 from l2_7 to l2_1 in c2.
4. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1.
5. Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1. (This satisfies the first constraint)
6. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
7. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1.
8. Load p1 onto a1 at l1_1. (This satisfies the second constraint)
9. Unload p1 from a1 at l1_1.
10. Drive t1 from l1_8 to l1_1 in c1.
11. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_1.
12. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_6 in c1.
13. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_6.
14. Drive t1 from l1_6 to l1_7 in c1.
15. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_7.
16. Drive t1 from l1_7 to l1_8 in c1.
17. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_8.

Actually, this is the same plan I had before. Let's see if I can further optimize by reordering the steps.

On further inspection, it doesn't appear I can optimize further. The plan is already pretty tight, and each step is necessary for the goal.
