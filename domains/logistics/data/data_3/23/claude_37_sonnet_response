Let me summarize the problem:

We have two cities c1 and c2, each with multiple locations including an airport. City c1 has locations l1_1 (airport), l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, and l1_5. City c2 has locations l2_1 (airport), l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, and l2_5.

We have two packages p1 and p2, two trucks t1 and t2, and two airplanes a1 and a2.

The initial state is:
- t1 is in location l1_4
- t2 is in location l2_1
- p1 is in location l2_3
- p2 is in location l2_5
- a1 is in location l1_1
- a2 is in location l2_1

The goal is:
- p1 is in location l2_4
- p2 is in location l2_1

There are also additional constraints:
1. At some point, p2 must be in location l2_1 (this is part of the goal anyway)
2. Before p2 can be in location l2_1, either p2 must be in location l1_4 or p1 must be in location l2_5
3. At some point, p1 must be in location l1_3
4. At some point, p2 must be in location l2_2

Let's think through the plan step by step.

First, let's note that there appears to be a typo in the initial state:
```
"Package t1 is in location l1_4"
"Package t2 is in location l2_1"
```
These should probably be "Truck t1" and "Truck t2" instead. Similarly, a1 and a2 should be "Airplane a1" and "Airplane a2". Let's proceed with that understanding.

Given the constraints, we need a plan that:
1. Moves p1 from l2_3 to l1_3 at some point, and then to l2_4 (final goal)
2. Moves p2 from l2_5 to l2_2 at some point, and then to l2_1 (final goal)
3. Ensures that before p2 is in l2_1, either p2 is in l1_4 or p1 is in l2_5

Let me think about how to satisfy these constraints efficiently.

For constraint 3, we need to move p1 from l2_3 to l1_3. This requires using an airplane to transport it from city c2 to city c1. Similarly, to meet the final goal, we need to move p1 back to city c2, specifically to l2_4.

For constraint 4, we need to move p2 from l2_5 to l2_2 at some point. Then, for the final goal, we need to move it to l2_1.

For constraint 2, before p2 can be in l2_1, either p2 must be in l1_4 or p1 must be in l2_5. Let's opt for moving p1 to l2_5, as this might be more efficient.

Let's outline the plan:

1. Move a truck (t2) to l2_3 to pick up p1
2. Move t2 with p1 to the airport l2_1
3. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1
4. Load p1 onto an airplane (a2)
5. Fly a2 with p1 to l1_1
6. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1
7. Move a truck (t1) to l1_1 to pick up p1
8. Move t1 with p1 to l1_3 (satisfying constraint 3)
9. Move t1 with p1 back to l1_1
10. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1
11. Load p1 onto a2
12. Fly a2 with p1 to l2_1
13. Unload p1 from a2 at l2_1
14. Move t2 to l2_1 (assuming it's not already there)
15. Load p1 onto t2
16. Move t2 with p1 to l2_5 (satisfying part of constraint 2)
17. Move a truck (t2) to l2_5 to pick up p2
18. Move t2 with p1 and p2 to l2_2 (satisfying constraint 4)
19. Unload p1 from t2 at some appropriate location
20. Move t2 with p2 to l2_1 (satisfying the final goal for p2)
21. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1
22. Load p1 onto t2 (if it was unloaded elsewhere)
23. Move t2 with p1 to l2_4 (satisfying the final goal for p1)
24. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_4

Actually, some parts of this plan are redundant or inefficient. Let me rethink it more carefully.

First, let's consider the constraints more explicitly:
- p1 starts at l2_3 and needs to end up at l2_4
- p2 starts at l2_5 and needs to end up at l2_1
- p1 must visit l1_3 at some point
- p2 must visit l2_2 at some point
- Before p2 reaches l2_1, either p2 must visit l1_4 or p1 must visit l2_5

Let me replan:

1. Move t2 to l2_3 to pick up p1
2. Move t2 with p1 to l2_5 (satisfying part of constraint 2)
3. Unload p1 at l2_5
4. Load p2 onto t2
5. Move t2 with p2 to l2_2 (satisfying constraint 4)
6. Move t2 with p2 to l2_1 (satisfying the final goal for p2)
7. Unload p2 at l2_1
8. Move t2 back to l2_5
9. Load p1 onto t2
10. Move t2 with p1 to l2_1
11. Unload p1 at l2_1
12. Load p1 onto a2
13. Fly a2 with p1 to l1_1
14. Unload p1 at l1_1
15. Move t1 to l1_1
16. Load p1 onto t1
17. Move t1 with p1 to l1_3 (satisfying constraint 3)
18. Move t1 with p1 back to l1_1
19. Unload p1 at l1_1
20. Load p1 onto a2
21. Fly a2 with p1 to l2_1
22. Unload p1 at l2_1
23. Move t2 to l2_1
24. Load p1 onto t2
25. Move t2 with p1 to l2_4 (satisfying the final goal for p1)
26. Unload p1 at l2_4

This is still quite a long plan. Let me check if there's a more efficient way.

Actually, I think I've been complicating it. Let's try a more direct approach.

First, observe that both packages start in city c2 and need to end in city c2. Hence, the use of airplanes might be minimal.

1. Move t2 to l2_3 to pick up p1
2. Move t2 with p1 to l2_5 (satisfying part of constraint 2)
3. Unload p1 at l2_5
4. Load p2 onto t2
5. Move t2 with p2 to l2_2 (satisfying constraint 4)
6. Move t2 with p2 to l2_1 (satisfying the final goal for p2)
7. Unload p2 at l2_1
8. Move t2 back to l2_5
9. Load p1 onto t2
10. Move t2 with p1 to l2_1
11. Unload p1 at l2_1
12. Load p1 onto a2
13. Fly a2 with p1 to l1_1
14. Unload p1 at l1_1
15. Move t1 to l1_1
16. Load p1 onto t1
17. Move t1 with p1 to l1_3 (satisfying constraint 3)
18. Move t1 with p1 back to l1_1
19. Unload p1 at l1_1
20. Load p1 onto a2
21. Fly a2 with p1 to l2_1
22. Unload p1 at l2_1
23. Move t2 to l2_1
24. Load p1 onto t2
25. Move t2 with p1 to l2_4 (satisfying the final goal for p1)
26. Unload p1 at l2_4

Wait, this is the exact same plan as before. I don't see a more efficient approach. Let me try to convert this to the exact action format:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2 (assuming t2 starts at l2_1 as per the initial state)
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
3. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (satisfying part of constraint 2)
5. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
6. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
7. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (satisfying constraint 4)
8. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
9. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
10. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (satisfying the final goal for p2)
11. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
12. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
13. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
14. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
15. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
16. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
17. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
18. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 (assuming t1 starts at l1_4 as per the initial state)
19. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
20. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
21. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (satisfying constraint 3)
22. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
23. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
24. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
25. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
26. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
27. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
28. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
29. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
30. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (satisfying the final goal for p1)

OK wait, I've noticed that I made an error. The action loadairplane p ap l, the preconditions state that ap and t are in the same location l. However, in the context of the provided actions, it should probably be that ap and p are in the same location l. Let me correct this.

Let me revise the plan to ensure all preconditions are met:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
3. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (satisfying part of constraint 2)
5. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
6. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
7. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (satisfying constraint 4)
8. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
9. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
10. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (satisfying the final goal for p2)
11. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
12. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
13. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
14. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
15. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
16. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
17. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
18. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
19. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
20. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
21. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (satisfying constraint 3)
22. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
23. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
24. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
25. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (this assumes a2 is still at l1_1, which might not be true)

Wait, I need to check where a2 is at this point. If a2 flew from l2_1 to l1_1 in step 16, and hasn't moved since, then it should still be at l1_1. So the above is correct.

26. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
27. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
28. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (this assumes t2 is at l2_1, but it might not be)

Let me check where t2 is. The last movement of t2 was in step 13, where it went from l2_5 to l2_1. So it should still be at l2_1, and the above step is valid.

29. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
30. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (satisfying the final goal for p1)


One second, I'm re-reading this problem, and I realized that the objects listed in the problem statement are:
```
The world includes the following objects:
	"location l1_2"
	"location l1_3"
	"location l1_4"
	"location l1_5"
	"location l2_2"
	"location l2_3"
	"location l2_4"
	"location l2_5"
	"city c1"
	"city c2"
	"package p1"
	"package p2"
	"truck t1"
	"truck t2"
	"airplane a1"
	"airplane a2"
	"airport l1_1"
	"airport l2_1"
```

l1_1 and l2_1 are identified as airports, not as locations, but the description indicates that an airport is a specific location in a city. So, l1_1 is the airport in city c1, and l2_1 is the airport in city c2. This distinction doesn't change the approach, but it's worth noting.

Let me re-examine the original state given in the problem:
```
"Location l1_1 is in city c1"
"Location l1_2 is in city c1"
"Location l1_3 is in city c1"
"Location l1_4 is in city c1"
"Location l1_5 is in city c1"
"Location l2_1 is in city c2"
"Location l2_2 is in city c2"
"Location l2_3 is in city c2"
"Location l2_4 is in city c2"
"Location l2_5 is in city c2"
"Package t1 is in location l1_4"
"Package t2 is in location l2_1"
"Package p1 is in location l2_3"
"Package p2 is in location l2_5"
"Package a1 is in location l1_1"
"Package a2 is in location l2_1"
```

There seems to be a typo in the problem statement. It mentions "Package t1", "Package t2", "Package a1", and "Package a2", but these should be "Truck t1", "Truck t2", "Airplane a1", and "Airplane a2", respectively. Let's proceed with the understanding that t1 and t2 are trucks, and a1 and a2 are airplanes.

Given the constraints, our goal is to bring about the situation where:
- p1 is in location l2_4
- p2 is in location l2_1

Now, let's review the constraints again:
1. At some point, p2 must be in location l2_1 (which is part of the goal).
2. Before p2 can be in location l2_1, either p2 must be in location l1_4 or p1 must be in location l2_5.
3. At some point, p1 must be in location l1_3.
4. At some point, p2 must be in location l2_2.

Now, let me carefully craft a plan to meet these goals and constraints. Let's take a more detailed, step-by-step approach.

Initial state:
- p1 is in location l2_3
- p2 is in location l2_5
- t1 is in location l1_4
- t2 is in location l2_1
- a1 is in location l1_1
- a2 is in location l2_1

For constraint 2, we need either p2 to be in l1_4 or p1 to be in l2_5 before p2 can be in l2_1. Let's opt to move p1 to l2_5, since p1 and p2 are already in city c2.

First, let's move p1 to l2_5:
1. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
3. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (satisfying part of constraint 2)

Now, let's move p2 to l2_2 (to satisfy constraint 4) and then to l2_1 (goal):
5. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
6. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
7. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (satisfying constraint 4)
8. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
9. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
10. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (satisfying the final goal for p2 and constraint 1)

For constraint 3, we need p1 to be in l1_3 at some point. We need to use an airplane to move p1 from city c2 to city c1:
11. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
12. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
13. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
14. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
15. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
16. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
17. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
18. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
19. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
20. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
21. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (satisfying constraint 3)

Finally, let's move p1 to l2_4 (goal):
22. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
23. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
24. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
25. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
26. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
27. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
28. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
29. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
30. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (satisfying the final goal for p1)

Hmm, I think I made a mistake in the plan above. Let me correct it:

First, let's move p1 to l2_5:
1. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
3. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (satisfying part of constraint 2)

Now, let's move p2 to l2_2 (to satisfy constraint 4) and then to l2_1 (goal):
5. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
6. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
7. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (satisfying constraint 4)
8. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
9. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
10. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (satisfying the final goal for p2 and constraint 1)

For constraint 3, we need p1 to be in l1_3 at some point. We need to use an airplane to move p1 from city c2 to city c1:
11. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
12. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
13. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
14. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
15. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
16. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
17. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
18. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
19. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
20. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
21. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (satisfying constraint 3)

Finally, let's move p1 to l2_4 (goal):
22. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
23. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
24. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
25. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
26. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
27. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
28. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
29. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
30. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (satisfying the final goal for p1)

This looks correct.

Let me just do a quick check of the constraints:
1. p2 is in l2_1 at the end (goal and constraint 1 ✓)
2. Before p2 is in l2_1, p1 is in l2_5 (constraint 2 ✓)
3. p1 is in l1_3 at one point (constraint 3 ✓)
4. p2 is in l2_2 at one point (constraint 4 ✓)

The plan achieves all the goals and constraints, and it seems to be optimal in terms of the number of steps. Let's provide it as the answer.

I notice that there's a potential issue with the plan: I am loading p1 back into a truck that already has p2 inside. Let me recheck whether a truck can carry multiple packages at once. The description says "Trucks and airplanes may carry packages", but it's unclear if they can carry multiple packages simultaneously.

Since the problem doesn't explicitly state that trucks can't carry multiple packages simultaneously, I'll assume they can, and stick with the above plan. If you need to adjust this, just let me know.

Actually, upon reflection, steps 11-14 are redundant and can be removed. p1 is already at l2_5, and we want to load it onto a2 at l2_1. We can simplify as follows:

First, let's move p1 to l2_5:
1. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
3. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (satisfying part of constraint 2)

Now, let's move p2 to l2_2 (to satisfy constraint 4) and then to l2_1 (goal):
5. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
6. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
7. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (satisfying constraint 4)
8. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
9. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
10. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (satisfying the final goal for p2 and constraint 1)

Now, let's go back to get p1:
11. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2

For constraint 3, we need p1 to be in l1_3 at some point. We need to use an airplane to move p1 from city c2 to city c1:
12. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
13. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
14. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
15. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
16. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
17. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
18. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
19. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
20. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
21. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (satisfying constraint 3)

Finally, let's move p1 to l2_4 (goal):
22. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
23. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
24. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
25. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
26. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
27. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
28. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
29. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
30. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (satisfying the final goal for p1)

Upon a final check, I realized that the action for unloading from an airplane is incorrectly named in the original list. It's listed as "loadairplane" for unloading, but it should be "unloadairplane". I'll correct this in the final plan. I'll also correct any other typos:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
3. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (satisfying part of constraint 2)
5. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
6. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
7. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (satisfying constraint 4)
8. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
9. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
10. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (satisfying the final goal for p2 and constraint 1)
11. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
12. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
13. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
14. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
15. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
16. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
17. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
18. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
19. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
20. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
21. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (satisfying constraint 3)
22. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
23. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
24. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
25. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
26. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
27. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
28. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
29. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
30. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (satisfying the final goal for p1)

This looks correct.
