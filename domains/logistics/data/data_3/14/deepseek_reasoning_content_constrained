Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. So, the goal is to get package p1 to location l2_8. But there are some constraints: p1 must be in l2_7 and l2_2 at some point, and also must be in airplane a2 at some state. Let me start by understanding the initial state.

From the original state, p1 is in l1_1, which is an airport in city c1. The airplanes a1 is in l1_1, and a2 is in l2_1. Trucks t1 is in l1_4, t2 in l2_2. So, to move p1 from c1 to c2, I probably need to use an airplane. But the constraints require that p1 is in a2. Since a2 starts in l2_1, which is in c2, how do we get p1 into a2?

Wait, maybe we need to first transport p1 to l2_1 where a2 is. But how? Let's see. The steps needed would involve:

1. Moving p1 from l1_1 to an airport in c1 (which it already is) via truck. Wait, but l1_1 is an airport. So maybe load p1 into a1, fly to l2_1, then unload into a2? But a2 is in l2_1. Wait, no. Wait, the airplanes can fly between airports. So a1 is in l1_1. So if we load p1 into a1, fly a1 to l2_1 (the airport in c2), then unload p1 there. Then, load p1 into a2 (since a2 is already at l2_1), then fly a2 to another airport? Wait, but the goal is l2_8, which is a regular location in c2, not an airport. So after getting p1 to l2_1 via a1, maybe use a truck in c2 to move it to l2_8. But the constraints require p1 to be in l2_2 and l2_7, and in a2.

Hmm. Let me outline possible steps:

Initial steps:

- Load p1 into a1 at l1_1. Then fly a1 to l2_1. Then unload p1 into l2_1. Now, p1 is at l2_1. Then, load p1 into a2 (since a2 is at l2_1). Then fly a2 to another airport, but wait, the only other airports are l1_1 and l2_1. Wait, no—each city has one airport. So cities c1 and c2 each have one airport: l1_1 and l2_1. So airplanes can only fly between these two airports. So a2 is at l2_1, which is the airport in c2. If we load p1 into a2, then fly a2 to another airport? But the only airports are l1_1 and l2_1. So maybe that's not useful. Wait, but the goal is to get p1 to l2_8, which is a regular location in c2.

So perhaps after getting p1 to l2_1 via a1, we need to use a truck in c2. But the truck t2 is in l2_2. So maybe unload p1 from a1 into l2_1, then load it into a truck (but there's no truck at l2_1 initially). Wait, the trucks are t1 in l1_4 (c1) and t2 in l2_2 (c2). So in c2, the available truck is t2, which is in l2_2. So to get p1 from l2_1 (airport) to l2_8, we might need to drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1, load p1, then drive to l2_8. But l2_8 is in c2. Wait, but l2_1 is the airport in c2. So driving t2 from l2_2 to l2_1 is possible. Then load p1 into t2, drive to l2_8. But wait, l2_8 is in c2. So let's check the city of each location. All l2_* are in c2. So yes.

But the constraints require p1 to be in l2_2 and l2_7. Also, p1 must be in a2 at some point. Let me see:

The constraint that p1 must be in a2: So, after p1 is in l2_1 (unloaded from a1), we need to load it into a2. Then unload it again. Because a2 is in l2_1, so we can load p1 into a2, then unload it back into l2_1. But that's perhaps a way to satisfy the "in a2" constraint. Then, using truck t2 to move it to l2_8 via l2_2 and l2_7.

Wait, but the constraints are that in at least one state, p1 is in l2_7, l2_2, and in a2. So perhaps:

Plan steps:

1. Load p1 into a1 at l1_1.
2. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
3. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1. Now p1 is at l2_1.
4. Load p1 into a2 at l2_1. Now p1 is in a2. (Satisfies the third constraint.)
5. Unload p1 from a2 at l2_1. Now p1 is back at l2_1.
6. Now, need to get it to l2_2. But how? Since t2 is at l2_2. So drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1 (airport), load p1 into t2, then drive to l2_2. Wait, but that would take p1 to l2_2. Then drive to l2_7, then to l2_8.

But let's see:

After step 5, p1 is in l2_1. Then:

6. Drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2. (Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1)
7. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1. (Now p1 is in t2)
8. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2. (Back to l2_2. Now, unloading here would put p1 in l2_2. That satisfies the second constraint.)
9. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2. (Now p1 is in l2_2)
10. Then, need to get it to l2_7. How? Using truck t2 again. So drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_7, then unload. But wait, can the truck drive directly from l2_2 to l2_7? The drivetruck action allows moving between any two locations in the same city. So yes.

Steps 10-12:

10. Drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_7 c2.
11. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2? Wait, no. After unloading in step 9, p1 is at l2_2. So to get it into the truck again, we need to load it again. But t2 is now at l2_2. So:

Wait, after step 9, p1 is in l2_2, and t2 is at l2_2. So:

10. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2. (Load p1 into t2 again)
11. Drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_7 c2. (Move to l2_7)
12. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_7. (Now p1 is in l2_7, satisfying the first constraint)
13. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_7. (To move it to l2_8)
14. Drivetruck t2 l2_7 l2_8 c2.
15. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_8. (Goal achieved)

But this seems a bit long. Let's check if that's optimal. Also, the constraints are that p1 must be in those locations at some state. So steps 9, 12, and 4 would satisfy the constraints. Let's count the steps:

1. loadtruck p1 a1 l1_1 (Wait, no: loadairplane for airplane. The action is loadairplane p ap l. So step 1 is loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1.

Wait, the initial state says "Package a1 is in location l1_1". Wait, wait, the original state lists:

"Package p1 is in location l1_1"

"Package a1 is in location l1_1"

Wait, but a1 is an airplane, not a package. Wait, looking back: the original state lists:

The world includes objects: "airplane a1", "airplane a2". Then in the original state:

"Package t1 is in location l1_4"

"Package t2 is in location l2_2"

"Package p1 is in location l1_1"

"Package a1 is in location l1_1"

"Package a2 is in location l2_1"

Wait, that's probably a typo. Because a1 and a2 are airplanes, not packages. So maybe that's a mistake in the problem statement. Because airplanes are not packages. So perhaps the problem statement has a mistake here. Because the initial state says "Package a1 is in location l1_1", but a1 is an airplane. So this must be an error. The correct initial state for airplanes should be "Airplane a1 is in location l1_1" and "Airplane a2 is in location l2_1". Similarly, trucks t1 and t2 are in their respective locations. So assuming that the original state has a typo, and "Package a1..." should be "Airplane a1...", then:

Original state:

Airplane a1 is in l1_1 (airport of c1)

Airplane a2 is in l2_1 (airport of c2)

Truck t1 is in l1_4 (c1)

Truck t2 is in l2_2 (c2)

Package p1 is in l1_1 (airport of c1)

So, the initial state is:

- p1 is at l1_1 (airport in c1)

- a1 (airplane) is at l1_1

- a2 (airplane) is at l2_1 (airport in c2)

- t1 (truck) at l1_4 (c1)

- t2 (truck) at l2_2 (c2)

So, the plan would be:

1. Load p1 into a1 at l1_1 (loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1)

2. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1 (flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1)

3. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1 (unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1) → p1 now at l2_1

Now, need to load p1 into a2 (which is at l2_1). So:

4. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 → now p1 is in a2 (satisfies constraint "p1 in a2")

5. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 → p1 back at l2_1

Now, need to get p1 to l2_2. How? Use truck t2, which is at l2_2. So drive t2 to l2_1, load p1, drive back to l2_2.

6. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2

7. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

8. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2

9. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 → p1 now at l2_2 (satisfies constraint)

Now, need to get to l2_7. So drive t2 to l2_7, unload.

10. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_7 c2

11. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_7 → p1 now at l2_7 (satisfies constraint)

But wait, after step 9, p1 is at l2_2. So to get to l2_7, need to load into truck again. Wait, no: after step 9, p1 is at l2_2, and t2 is at l2_2. So steps:

10. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

11. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_7 c2

12. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_7 → now p1 is in l2_7

Then, take it to l2_8:

13. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_7

14. drivetruck t2 l2_7 l2_8 c2

15. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_8 → goal achieved.

But this is quite long. Maybe there's a shorter way.

Wait, after step 5, p1 is at l2_1. Let's think: can we use a2 to fly p1 to another airport? But airports are only in c1 and c2. l2_1 is the airport in c2. So flying a2 from l2_1 to l1_1 (c1's airport) would take p1 back to c1, which is not helpful. So flying a2 isn't useful here. So the only way is to use truck t2 in c2.

Alternatively, after step 5, when p1 is at l2_1, can we drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1 (step 6), load p1 (step7), then drive to l2_8 via l2_2 and l2_7. But the constraints require p1 to be in l2_2 and l2_7. So perhaps after loading into t2 at l2_1, drive to l2_2, unload (satisfy l2_2), then drive to l2_7, unload (satisfy l2_7), then drive to l2_8.

Let's see:

After step 5 (p1 at l2_1):

6. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 → t2 now at l2_1

7. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 → p1 in t2

8. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2 → arrive at l2_2

9. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 → satisfies l2_2

10. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 → reload

11. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_7 c2 → move to l2_7

12. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_7 → satisfies l2_7

13. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_7 → reload

14. drivetruck t2 l2_7 l2_8 c2 → move to l2_8

15. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_8 → done

This is 15 steps. But maybe some steps can be merged. For example, after step 9 (unload at l2_2), step 10 is load again, then drive to l2_7. But maybe after step 9, p1 is in l2_2, then we can use another method. But the problem requires that the constraints are met in at least one state. So we can pass through l2_2 and l2_7, but need to unload there.

Alternatively, after loading into t2 at l2_1 (step7), drive to l2_2 (step8), unload (step9), which satisfies the l2_2 constraint. Then load again (step10), drive to l2_7 (step11), unload (step12), which satisfies l2_7. Then load again (step13), drive to l2_8, unload.

So that's 13 steps from the beginning. Let's count the total steps:

1. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

2. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

3. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

4. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 → satisfies "in a2"

5. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

6. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2

7. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

8. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2

9. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 → satisfies l2_2

10. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

11. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_7 c2

12. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_7 → satisfies l2_7

13. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_7

14. drivetruck t2 l2_7 l2_8 c2

15. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_8 → goal

But maybe there's a shorter path. For example, after step5 (p1 at l2_1), drive t2 to l2_1, load, then drive to l2_2 (unload), then to l2_7 (unload), then to l2_8 (unload). So steps 6-15. That's 10 steps. Let's count:

From initial to step5: 5 steps.

Then:

6. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 → step6

7. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 → step7

8. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2 → step8

9. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 → step9 (constraint)

10. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_7 c2 → step10 (but p1 is at l2_2 now, not in the truck. So we need to load it again.)

Wait, after step9, p1 is at l2_2. So step10 would need to load p1 into t2 again, which is at l2_2. So:

10. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 → step10

11. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_7 c2 → step11

12. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_7 → step12 (constraint)

13. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_7 → step13

14. drivetruck t2 l2_7 l2_8 → step14

15. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_8 → step15

So that's 15 steps. No way around it. But maybe there's a smarter way. Let's think: after loading into t2 at l2_1 (step7), drive to l2_7 via l2_2. But the truck can only move between locations in the same city. So from l2_1, can we drive to l2_7 directly? If l2_1 is connected to l2_7 via a single drive action. According to the problem, the drivetruck action can move between any two locations in the same city. So yes. So perhaps:

After step7 (p1 loaded into t2 at l2_1), drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2 (step8), unload (step9: l2_2), then drive to l2_7 (step10), unload (step11: l2_7), then drive to l2_8 (step12), unload (step13). But that would still require steps:

6. drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1

7. load p1 into t2 at l2_1

8. drive to l2_2 → unload (l2_2)

9. drive to l2_7 → unload (l2_7)

10. drive to l2_8 → unload

But how to do this. Let's see:

6. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 → t2 at l2_1

7. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

8. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2 → t2 at l2_2

9. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 → constraint met

10. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

11. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_7 c2 → t2 at l2_7

12. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_7 → constraint met

13. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_7

14. drivetruck t2 l2_7 l2_8 c2 → t2 at l2_8

15. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_8 → done

This is 15 steps. But is there a way to reduce the steps? Let's see.

What if after loading into t2 (step7), we drive directly to l2_7, then to l2_8, but how to meet the l2_2 constraint?

Wait, the constraints require p1 to be in l2_2 and l2_7 at some state. So if during the plan, p1 is at l2_2 and l2_7, then it's okay. But how can we get p1 to l2_2 and l2_7 in the same plan without going back?

Alternatively, after step5 (p1 at l2_1), drive t2 to l2_1, load, then drive to l2_2 (unload), then drive to l2_7 (unload), then drive to l2_8 (unload). But then steps would be:

6. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 → step6

7. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 → step7

8. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2 → step8

9. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 → step9 (l2_2)

10. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 → step10

11. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_7 c2 → step11

12. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_7 → step12 (l2_7)

13. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_7 → step13

14. drivetruck t2 l2_7 l2_8 c2 → step14

15. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_8 → step15

Same as before. So 15 steps. Is there a shorter way? Maybe not. Let's see if there's any redundancy.

For example, after step4, when p1 is loaded into a2, we can immediately unload it. That's steps4 and 5. That's necessary to meet the "in a2" constraint. So steps4 and 5 are required.

Then, steps6-15 are needed to move p1 to l2_8 via l2_2 and l2_7.

Is there a way to combine some steps? For example, when moving from l2_1 to l2_2, can we go through l2_7? But the truck can drive directly between any two locations in the same city. So perhaps:

After step7 (p1 loaded into t2 at l2_1), drive directly to l2_7 (step8). Then unload (step9: l2_7), then drive to l2_2 (step10), unload (step11: l2_2), then drive to l2_8 (step12). But this would require:

8. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_7 c2 → possible.

9. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_7 → constraint met.

10. drivetruck t2 l2_7 l2_2 c2 → drive to l2_2

11. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 → constraint met.

But after step9, p1 is in l2_7. To get it to l2_2, we need to load again. So:

10. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_7

11. drivetruck t2 l2_7 l2_2 c2

12. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 → constraint.

Then drive to l2_8:

13. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

14. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_8 c2 → but can we go directly from l2_2 to l2_8? Or do we need to go via l2_7? If possible, drive directly.

But the problem says that trucks can move between any two locations in the same city. So yes. So:

14. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_8 c2 → unload.

But in that case, the constraints are met (l2_7 and l2_2), but the steps would be:

1. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

2. fly a1 l1_1 l2_1

3. unload p1 from a1 at l2_1

4. load p1 into a2 at l2_1

5. unload p1 from a2 at l2_1

6. drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1

7. load p1 into t2 at l2_1

8. drive t2 to l2_7

9. unload p1 at l2_7 (constraint)

10. load p1 into t2 at l2_7

11. drive to l2_2

12. unload at l2_2 (constraint)

13. load again, drive to l2_8

14. unload.

That's 14 steps. But steps6-14:

6. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2

7. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

8. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_7 c2

9. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_7 → constraint

10. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_7

11. drivetruck t2 l2_7 l2_2 c2

12. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 → constraint

13. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

14. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_8 c2

15. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_8 → goal

So still 15 steps. Hmm.

Wait, maybe after step7, when p1 is in t2 at l2_1, drive directly to l2_7, then unload (step8), then drive to l2_8, but how to satisfy l2_2 constraint. So that would miss the l2_2 constraint. So this approach wouldn't work.

Alternatively, after step5 (p1 at l2_1), drive t2 to l2_1, load p1, drive to l2_2, unload (constraint met), then drive to l2_7 (unload), then to l2_8. That would require:

6. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2

7. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

8. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2 → unload (step9)

9. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 → constraint

10. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

11. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_7 c2 → unload (step12)

12. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_7 → constraint

13. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_7

14. drivetruck t2 l2_7 l2_8 c2 → unload (step15)

15. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_8 → done

Same as before. So no way to shorten. So the total steps are 15.

But is there a way to avoid some steps? Like combining the load and unload steps.

Wait, maybe after step5 (p1 at l2_1), instead of driving t2 to l2_1, can we load p1 into another vehicle? But the only truck in c2 is t2, which is at l2_2. So no other truck. So we have to use t2.

Alternative approach: After step5, p1 is at l2_1. Then, load into a2 (step4) and then fly to another airport? But the only other airport is l1_1. That would take p1 back to c1, which is not helpful. So that's not useful.

So, the plan must include the steps to get p1 from l2_1 to l2_8 via truck t2, passing through l2_2 and l2_7.

So the steps are as follows:

1. Load airplane a1 with p1 at l1_1.
2. Fly a1 to l2_1.
3. Unload p1 at l2_1.
4. Load p1 into a2 (to satisfy constraint).
5. Unload p1 from a2 (now back at l2_1).
6. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1.
7. Load p1 into t2.
8. Drive t2 to l2_2 and unload (satisfy l2_2).
9. Load p1 again into t2.
10. Drive to l2_7 and unload (satisfy l2_7).
11. Load p1 again into t2.
12. Drive to l2_8 and unload.

But written as actions, that's:

loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2

loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2

unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_7 c2

unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_7

loadtruck p1 t2 l2_7

drivetruck t2 l2_7 l2_8 c2

unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_8

That's 15 actions. But maybe there's a shorter way by combining some steps. For example, after step5 (unload from a2), we have p1 at l2_1. Then, step6 is drive t2 to l2_1, step7 load p1, then drive to l2_2 (step8), unload (step9), then drive to l2_7 (step10), unload (step11), drive to l2_8 (step12), unload (step13). So steps6-13 would be 8 steps, totaling 13 steps.

Wait, original steps:

1. loadairplane

2. fly

3. unload

4. loadairplane

5. unload

6. drivetruck (t2 to l2_1)

7. loadtruck

8. drivetruck to l2_2

9. unload

10. drivetruck to l2_7

11. unload

12. drivetruck to l2_8

13. unload.

Wait, no, after step9 (unload at l2_2), p1 is at l2_2. So to get to l2_7, we need to load it again. So:

10. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

11. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_7 c2

12. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_7

13. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_7

14. drivetruck t2 l2_7 l2_8 c2

15. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_8

So that's still 15 steps.

Hmm. I think this is the optimal plan given the constraints. Let's check if all constraints are met:

- "p1 is in a2" → step4 (loaded into a2).

- "p1 is in l2_2" → step9.

- "p1 is in l2_7" → step12.

Yes. And the final step is in l2_8.

So this plan should be valid. Now, is there a way to make it shorter?

What if after step5 (p1 at l2_1), we drive t2 to l2_1, load p1, then drive to l2_7, unload (satisfy l2_7), then drive to l2_2, unload (satisfy l2_2), then drive to l2_8. But would that work?

Steps:

6. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2

7. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

8. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_7 c2

9. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_7 → constraint

10. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_7

11. drivetruck t2 l2_7 l2_2 c2

12. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 → constraint

13. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

14. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_8 c2

15. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_8

Same number of steps. No improvement.

Alternatively, after step7 (p1 loaded into t2 at l2_1), drive to l2_8 directly, but that skips the constraints. So no.

Thus, the optimal plan is 15 steps. But maybe there's a more optimal plan.

Wait, perhaps after step3, when p1 is at l2_1, instead of loading into a2, perhaps load into truck t2 directly. But then the constraint that p1 is in a2 is not met. So we need to load into a2 at some point.

So steps4 and 5 are necessary.

Thus, the plan is as outlined. So I think the correct plan is as follows, with the steps I listed earlier.
