Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. First, I need to understand the initial state, the goal, and the constraints. 

The initial state has packages p1 and p2 in different cities. p1 is in l1_2 (city c1), and p2 is in l2_2 (city c2). The goal is to have p1 in l1_5 (still city c1) and p2 must stay in l2_2. Wait, but the goal for p2 is already satisfied in the initial state. So the main task is moving p1 from l1_2 to l1_5. But there are constraints to satisfy.

Constraints:
1. At some state, p1 must be in l1_2. But initially, p1 is already there. So maybe this is automatically satisfied. However, the problem says "must hold in at least one state", so if the initial state counts, then that's covered. But I need to make sure that if during the plan, p1 leaves l1_2 and then comes back, it might need to be there again. But since the initial state is part of the states, this constraint is already met. But perhaps the problem expects that during the plan execution, p1 is in l1_2 again. Hmm, need to check.

2. If in any state s, p1 is in l1_2, then either in s or some state after, p1 must be in l1_1 or l2_3. Since the initial state has p1 in l1_2, we need to ensure that either in the initial state (which it's not, since p1 is in l1_2 and not in l1_1 or l2_3), or in some subsequent state, p1 is in one of those locations. Wait, but the constraint is a conditional: whenever p1 is in l1_2, then at that state or later, it must be in l1_1 or l2_3. But since the initial state has p1 in l1_2, we must ensure that either at the initial state (which doesn't satisfy the consequent) or in some state after, p1 is in l1_1 or l2_3. So the plan must include moving p1 to either of those locations at some point after the initial state.

3. At some state, either p1 is in a1 or p2 is in l2_3. So we need to have either of these conditions true at some point.

4. At some state, both p2 is in l1_4 and p1 is in a2. That seems tricky because p2 starts in l2_2 (city c2) and needs to be moved to l1_4 (city c1). How can we do that? Since trucks are city-bound, to move between cities, we need airplanes. So maybe use an airplane to transport p2 from c2 to c1. But p2's final goal is to be in l2_2, so after moving it to l1_4, we need to bring it back. But that's conflicting with the goal. Wait, the goal requires p2 to stay in l2_2. Oh, wait the goal says "Package p2 is in location l2_2" which is already true initially. So maybe the constraints require that p2 is moved to l1_4 and then back? But that's a problem because moving p2 to l1_4 would require violating the goal unless we move it back. But the goal must be achieved at the end. So perhaps the plan must first move p2 to l1_4 (satisfying the fourth constraint), then move it back to l2_2 to meet the goal. But how?

Wait, the fourth constraint says that in some state, p2 is in l1_4 and p1 is in a2. So at some point, both must be true. Let's see:

To get p2 to l1_4 (which is in c1), since p2 starts in l2_2 (c2), we need to move it via airplane. So steps would involve:

1. Move p2 from l2_2 to l2_1 (the airport in c2) using truck t2. Because trucks can move within the city. So load p2 into t2 at l2_2, drive to l2_1, then unload. Then load into airplane a2 (assuming a2 is at l2_1?), fly to l1_1 (c1's airport). Then unload from a2, load into truck t1, drive to l1_4, unload. Then, to get p2 back to l2_2, need to reverse the process: load into truck t1, drive to l1_1, load into a2, fly back to l2_1, unload, load into truck t2, drive back to l2_2. But this seems lengthy. However, the goal requires p2 to be in l2_2 at the end. So if we do this, p2 would end up back there. But this would require a lot of steps. Also, for constraint 4, p1 must be in a2 at the same time p2 is in l1_4. How can p1 be in a2 (which is in c2's airport l2_1)? Because p1 starts in c1. So to get p1 into a2, which is in c2, we need to fly p1 from c1 to c2. So steps would involve moving p1 via airplane a1 from c1 to c2. But that complicates things. Let's outline this.

First, let's handle the main goal: moving p1 to l1_5. Let's think about that. Since p1 is in l1_2 (c1), we can use truck t1 (which is in l1_4 initially) to move it. Wait, the initial state says "Package t1 is in location l1_4" but t1 is a truck, so that's a typo? Wait, the original state says:

"Package t1 is in location l1_4"

But t1 is a truck. Wait, trucks are not packages. That must be a mistake. Looking back:

The original state of the world is the following:

"Package t1 is in location l1_4"

"Package t2 is in location l2_4"

Wait, that's incorrect. The user probably meant "Truck t1 is in location l1_4" and "Truck t2 is in location l2_4". Because trucks are objects, not packages. Similarly, airplanes are in airports. Let me check the problem statement again.

Wait, the user wrote:

"The original state of the world is the following:

...

"Package t1 is in location l1_4"

"Package t2 is in location l2_4"

"Package p1 is in location l1_2"

"Package p2 is in location l2_2"

"Package a1 is in location l1_1"

"Package a2 is in location l2_1"

"

Wait, that's a problem. Because t1 and t2 are trucks, a1 and a2 are airplanes. But in the initial state, they are listed as packages. That must be a mistake. Because in the list of objects, we have:

"package p1"

"package p2"

"truck t1"

"truck t2"

"airplane a1"

"airplane a2"

So the original state must have:

"Truck t1 is in location l1_4"

"Truck t2 is in location l2_4"

"Airplane a1 is in location l1_1"

"Airplane a2 is in location l2_1"

And the packages p1, p2 are in their respective locations. But the user wrote "Package t1...", which is incorrect. This is a critical error. Because if t1 is a truck, it's not a package, so its location is separate. So I need to correct this in my understanding. However, since the user provided the problem as such, I have to proceed with their description. But this is conflicting because trucks and airplanes are not packages, so their locations are part of the state. So perhaps this is a typo, and the correct initial state is:

Truck t1 is in l1_4

Truck t2 is in l2_4

Airplane a1 is in l1_1

Airplane a2 is in l2_1

Packages:

p1 in l1_2

p2 in l2_2

That makes sense. So the user probably made a mistake in labeling trucks and airplanes as packages. So I'll proceed with the corrected initial state.

So initial locations:

Trucks:

t1 in l1_4 (c1)

t2 in l2_4 (c2)

Airplanes:

a1 in l1_1 (c1's airport)

a2 in l2_1 (c2's airport)

Packages:

p1 in l1_2 (c1)

p2 in l2_2 (c2)

Now, the goal is to have p1 in l1_5 (c1) and p2 in l2_2 (which is already true). So the main task is moving p1 from l1_2 to l1_5.

Constraints:

1. At least once, p1 is in l1_2. Since the initial state satisfies this, but if during the plan p1 is moved out, we need to bring it back. Wait, no: the constraint says "must hold in at least one state". Since the initial state is part of the states, this is already satisfied. So maybe no need to do anything for this constraint. But perhaps the problem requires that during the plan execution (excluding the initial state), p1 is in l1_2. But the wording is "at least one state", which includes the initial state. So maybe this constraint is already satisfied.

But the second constraint is a conditional. Let's re-examine it:

"If in some state s, p1 is in l1_2, then in s or some state after, p1 must be in l1_1 or l2_3."

Since the initial state s0 has p1 in l1_2, then in s0 or after, p1 must be in l1_1 or l2_3. Since s0 has p1 in l1_2 but not in l1_1 or l2_3, the consequent must hold in some state after s0. So the plan must include moving p1 to l1_1 or l2_3 at some point after the initial state.

Third constraint: At some state, either p1 is in a1 or p2 is in l2_3.

Fourth constraint: At some state, both p2 is in l1_4 and p1 is in a2.

So let's outline the steps needed, considering all constraints.

First, moving p1 to l1_5. The straightforward way would be:

1. Load p1 into truck t1 (but t1 is in l1_4, and p1 is in l1_2. So need to move t1 from l1_4 to l1_2. Then load p1 into t1, drive to l1_5, unload.

But wait, t1 is in l1_4. To move it to l1_2, which is in the same city (c1). So drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_2. Then load p1, then drive to l1_5.

But this would satisfy the main goal. However, the constraints require:

- After the initial state, p1 must be moved to l1_1 or l2_3. So during the plan, after s0, p1 must go to one of those locations. So if the plan is just moving t1 to l1_2, load p1, drive to l1_5, then unload, then the constraint is violated because after s0, p1 is moved from l1_2 to t1, then to l1_5. But the conditional says that if p1 is in l1_2 (as in s0), then at some point after, it must be in l1_1 or l2_3. So the plan must include moving p1 to either l1_1 or l2_3 after the initial state. So the simple plan would not satisfy this. Therefore, the plan must include moving p1 to l1_1 or l2_3 at some point.

Additionally, the third constraint requires that at some state, either p1 is in a1 or p2 is in l2_3. And the fourth requires that at some state, both p2 is in l1_4 and p1 is in a2.

So let's tackle these one by one.

First, moving p1 to l1_1 (airport of c1). To do that, we can use truck t1. So after moving p1 to l1_1, perhaps load it into airplane a1, fly to another airport, but then need to bring it back. But that might complicate things.

Alternatively, moving p1 to l2_3 (which is in c2). To do that, we need to use airplanes. So steps would involve:

- Move p1 from l1_2 to l1_1 (using truck t1), load into a1, fly to l2_1 (c2's airport), unload, then move to l2_3 via truck t2. Then, perhaps move back. But this would make p1 end up in l2_3, which is not the goal. So need to bring it back to c1.

But the goal is l1_5. So this would require multiple steps. However, perhaps we can combine this with the fourth constraint, which requires p2 to be in l1_4 and p1 in a2.

So let's think:

To satisfy constraint 4: p2 in l1_4 and p1 in a2. So a2 is in l2_1 (c2's airport). So p1 must be loaded into a2, which is in l2_1. So to get p1 into a2, we need to transport p1 to l2_1. So steps:

- Move p1 from l1_2 to l1_1 via truck t1.

- Load into a1, fly to l2_1.

- Unload p1 into l2_1.

- Load p1 into a2 (but a2 is in l2_1, so possible).

Wait, but a2 is an airplane. So to load p1 into a2, the airplane must be in l2_1. Which it is initially. So after flying a1 to l2_1, unload p1 into l2_1. Then load p1 into a2. But why would we do that? Because then p1 is in a2, which satisfies part of constraint 4. Then, perhaps fly a2 to l1_1 (c1's airport), unload p1, and then use truck to move to l1_5.

But also, we need to move p2 to l1_4. So for that, we need to get p2 from l2_2 to l1_4. Steps:

- Use truck t2 in c2 (starts in l2_4) to drive to l2_2, load p2, drive to l2_1 (airport).

- Load p2 into a2, fly to l1_1 (c1's airport).

- Unload p2 into l1_1, load into truck t1, drive to l1_4, unload. So p2 is in l1_4.

At this point, we have p2 in l1_4. Now, to satisfy constraint 4, we also need p1 to be in a2. So perhaps during this process, when a2 is in l1_1 (after flying from l2_1 to l1_1), p1 can be loaded into a2. Wait, but a2 is in l1_1 after flying there. So if p1 is in l1_1 (unloaded from a1), then load p1 into a2. Then, a2 can fly back to l2_1, but that would move p1 back to c2. But the goal is to have p1 in l1_5. So this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, after moving p2 to l1_4, we can have p1 loaded into a2 at l1_1. So during the same time when p2 is in l1_4, p1 is in a2. But how?

Let me outline a possible plan step by step, considering all constraints.

First, handle the conditional constraint that requires after p1 is in l1_2 (initially), it must be moved to l1_1 or l2_3. Let's choose l1_1 because it's in the same city and easier.

So steps for p1:

1. Drive truck t1 from l1_4 to l1_2 (c1). Because t1 is initially in l1_4.

Action: drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1

2. Load p1 into t1 at l1_2.

Action: loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2

Now p1 is in t1.

3. Drive t1 to l1_1 (airport of c1).

Action: drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1

4. Unload p1 from t1 into l1_1.

Action: unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

Now p1 is in l1_1. This satisfies the conditional constraint because after the initial state, p1 was moved to l1_1. So the requirement is met.

But now, to proceed to the goal of l1_5, we need to move p1 from l1_1 to l1_5. Since l1_1 is the airport, and l1_5 is another location in c1, we can use truck t1 again.

5. Load p1 into t1 at l1_1.

Action: loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

6. Drive t1 to l1_5.

Action: drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1

7. Unload p1 into l1_5.

Action: unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5

This achieves the main goal. But we need to check other constraints.

Third constraint: At some state, either p1 is in a1 or p2 is in l2_3.

In the current plan steps, p1 is in l1_1 (after step 4). a1 is in l1_1 initially. So if we load p1 into a1, that would satisfy the third constraint. Let's adjust the plan.

After step 4 (p1 in l1_1):

5. Load p1 into a1 at l1_1.

Action: loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

Now p1 is in a1. This satisfies the third constraint (p1 in a1). Then, to get p1 to l1_5, we need to unload it from a1, but a1 is in l1_1. Wait, if we load p1 into a1, then fly a1 somewhere else, but that might not be needed. Alternatively, after loading p1 into a1, we can unload it back into l1_1, but that's redundant. Alternatively, perhaps we can fly a1 to another airport, but that's unnecessary. So perhaps inserting step 5 here would satisfy the third constraint.

Then, unload p1 from a1 back into l1_1:

6. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

Then proceed to load into t1 and drive to l1_5. But this adds steps. However, the problem requires an optimal plan (shortest possible). So this may not be optimal. Alternatively, perhaps during the initial movement of p1 to l1_1, we can load it into a1, then immediately unload, which would satisfy the third constraint. Let's see:

Original steps modified:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1

2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2

3. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1

4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

5. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 → p1 is in a1 (satisfies third constraint)

6. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 → p1 back in l1_1

7. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

8. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1

9. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5

This adds two more steps but satisfies the third constraint. However, is there a way to combine this without adding steps? For example, if we can load p1 into a1 and then unload it into the same location, but that's redundant. Alternatively, perhaps using the airplane to move p1 somewhere else and back, but that's more steps.

But let's think again. The third constraint requires that at some state, either p1 is in a1 or p2 is in l2_3. So if we have p1 loaded into a1 (step 5), then that state satisfies the third constraint. So after step 5, we can proceed to unload p1 and move on. So the steps would be:

1. Drive t1 to l1_2.

2. Load p1 into t1.

3. Drive to l1_1.

4. Unload p1 into l1_1.

5. Load p1 into a1 (now in a1).

6. Unload p1 back into l1_1.

7. Load into t1, drive to l1_5, unload.

This makes the plan longer but satisfies the third constraint. However, the problem requires an optimal plan (shortest possible). So maybe there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, can we have p2 moved to l2_3 to satisfy the third constraint? But p2 is in l2_2 initially. To move to l2_3 (same city c2), use truck t2.

So steps for p2:

- Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_2.

- Load p2 into t2.

- Drive to l2_3.

- Unload p2 into l2_3.

This would satisfy the third constraint (p2 in l2_3). Then, after that, move p2 back to l2_2 to meet the goal.

But the goal requires p2 to be in l2_2, so moving it to l2_3 and back would require extra steps. However, perhaps this is shorter overall than moving p1 into a1.

So let's compare:

Option 1: Move p1 into a1 (adds two steps: load and unload).

Option 2: Move p2 to l2_3 and back (adds four steps: drive t2 to l2_2, load, drive to l2_3, unload; then drive back to l2_2, load, drive to l2_3, unload? Wait, no. To move p2 to l2_3 and back:

Steps:

For p2:

1. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_2.

Action: drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2

2. Load p2 into t2.

Action: loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

3. Drive to l2_3.

Action: drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2

4. Unload p2 into l2_3.

Action: unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 → satisfies third constraint.

Then, to return p2 to l2_2:

5. Load p2 into t2.

Action: loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3

6. Drive to l2_2.

Action: drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2

7. Unload p2 into l2_2.

Action: unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

This adds four steps (steps 1-7). However, in the original plan for p1, we only need steps 1-9 (9 steps). But if we handle the third constraint via p2, perhaps it's longer. So option 1 (moving p1 into a1) adds two steps, while option 2 adds four. So option 1 is better.

But we also need to handle the fourth constraint: p2 in l1_4 and p1 in a2.

This is more complex. Let's think.

To get p2 into l1_4 (c1), we need to move it from l2_2 (c2) to l1_4. This requires using an airplane. Steps:

1. Move p2 from l2_2 to l2_1 (c2's airport) via truck t2.

2. Load p2 into airplane a2.

3. Fly a2 to l1_1 (c1's airport).

4. Unload p2 into l1_1.

5. Load p2 into truck t1 (in l1_1? Or need to drive t1 there).

t1 is initially in l1_4. So to get t1 to l1_1, drive:

Action: drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1

Then load p2 into t1.

Drive to l1_4, unload.

But then p2 is in l1_4. But the goal requires p2 to be in l2_2, so we need to return it. This would require moving p2 back to l2_2 via reverse steps.

But this adds a lot of steps. However, the fourth constraint requires that in some state, p2 is in l1_4 and p1 is in a2.

Additionally, p1 must be in a2 at the same time. So during this process, p1 must be loaded into a2.

So combining steps:

For p1 to be in a2:

a2 is in l2_1 initially. So to load p1 into a2, p1 must be in l2_1. So we need to move p1 from c1 to c2.

Steps for p1:

1. Drive t1 to l1_2, load p1, drive to l1_1.

2. Load p1 into a1, fly a1 to l2_1.

3. Unload p1 into l2_1.

4. Load p1 into a2 (now in l2_1).

At this point, p1 is in a2. Now, if p2 is in l1_4, we need to have p2 transported there. So during the same timeframe:

For p2:

1. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_2, load p2, drive to l2_1.

2. Load p2 into a2, fly to l1_1.

3. Unload p2 into l1_1.

4. Drive t1 (already in l1_1) to l1_4, unload p2.

At this point, p2 is in l1_4 and p1 is in a2 (after step 4 of p1's steps). So this satisfies the fourth constraint.

But then we need to return p2 to l2_2 and p1 to l1_5.

This is getting very complicated. Let's outline the entire plan:

Steps for p1:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1

2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2

3. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1

4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

5. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

6. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

7. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

8. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 → now p1 is in a2

Steps for p2:

9. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2

10. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

11. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2

12. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

13. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

14. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

15. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

16. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_1 c1 (wait, t1 is already in l1_1 after step 3?)

No, after step 3, t1 is in l1_1. So after step 4, t1 is still in l1_1. Then in step 5, we load p1 into a1. So t1 is in l1_1. So for p2:

After step 15, p2 is in l1_1. Load into t1:

17. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

18. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

19. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 → now p2 is in l1_4 and p1 is in a2 (step 8). So this satisfies constraint 4.

Now, need to return p2 to l2_2:

20. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

21. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1

22. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

23. loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 → but a2 is in l1_1 after step 14.

24. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1

25. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

26. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 → but t2 is in l2_1 after step 11.

Wait, after step 11, t2 was driven to l2_1, then p2 was unloaded in step 12. So t2 is in l2_1. After step 12, t2 is in l2_1. Then step 13 loads p2 into a2, so t2 is still in l2_1. So after step 25, p2 is in l2_1. To return it to l2_2:

26. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

27. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2

28. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 → goal satisfied.

For p1, after step 8, p1 is in a2. To get to l1_5:

29. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l1_1 → no, a2 is in l2_1 after step 24. Wait, this is getting too complicated. Let's retrace:

After step 14, a2 flies from l2_1 to l1_1. So after step 14, a2 is in l1_1. Then step 15 unloads p2 into l1_1. Then steps 17-19 move p2 to l1_4. Then step 23 loads p2 into a2 (which is in l1_1), then fly back to l2_1 (step 24), unload p2 (step 25). Then load into t2 (step 26), drive to l2_2 (steps 27-28). 

For p1: after step 8, p1 is in a2, which is in l2_1. Then step 24 flies a2 back to l2_1 (but wait, after step 14, a2 was in l1_1. So step 24 is fly from l1_1 to l2_1. So after step 24, a2 is in l2_1 with p2. Then in step 25, unload p2, so a2 is empty. p1 is still in a2 from step 8? No, because after step 8, p1 is loaded into a2 in l2_1 (step 8: loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1). Then step 13 is load p2 into a2 (same location l2_1). Wait, no: step 13 is after step 12 (unload p2 in l2_1). So step 13 is load p2 into a2 in l2_1. Then fly a2 to l1_1 (step 14). So during this flight, both p1 and p2 are in a2. Then step 15 unloads p2 into l1_1. So p1 is still in a2. Then step 24 flies a2 back to l2_1, so p1 is still in a2. Then step 25 unloads p2, but p1 remains in a2. Wait, no: when you unload p2, p1 is still in a2. Then in step 26, we load p2 into t2, which is in l2_1. Then steps 27-28 move p2 back to l2_2.

So p1 is still in a2, which is in l2_1. To get p1 back to c1 and then to l1_5:

30. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

31. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

32. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 → t1 is in l1_1 (after step 21, which was drivetruck t1 l1_4 to l1_1?)

Wait, step 21: drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 → yes, after step 21, t1 is in l1_1. So load p1 into t1.

33. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1

34. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 → goal achieved.

This is a very long plan. But the problem requires an optimal plan. This approach may not be optimal. Let's count the steps:

Steps 1-34. That's 34 actions. But there must be a shorter way.

Alternatively, perhaps we can interleave the steps to satisfy the constraints more efficiently.

Let's try to find a shorter plan.

First, handle constraint 4: p2 in l1_4 and p1 in a2.

To get p2 to l1_4:

- Use truck t2 to move p2 from l2_2 to l2_1.

- Load into a2, fly to l1_1.

- Unload, load into truck t1, drive to l1_4.

To get p1 into a2:

- Move p1 to l2_1 via a1.

So steps:

For p1:

1. Drive t1 to l1_2, load p1, drive to l1_1.

2. Load into a1, fly to l2_1.

3. Unload into l2_1, load into a2.

For p2:

4. Drive t2 to l2_2, load p2, drive to l2_1.

5. Load into a2, fly to l1_1.

6. Unload into l1_1, load into t1, drive to l1_4, unload.

At this point, p2 is in l1_4 and p1 is in a2 (after step 3). This satisfies constraint 4.

Then, return p2 to l2_2:

7. Load p2 into t1, drive to l1_1, load into a2, fly to l2_1, unload, load into t2, drive to l2_2, unload.

For p1, after being in a2 (step 3), fly a2 to l1_1, unload p1, load into t1, drive to l1_5.

This is still many steps.

But perhaps there's a way to overlap some actions.

Let me try to outline the plan:

Actions for p1 and p2:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1

2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2

3. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1

4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 → p1 in l1_1

5. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

6. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 → a1 now in l2_1

7. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 → p1 in l2_1

8. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 → p1 in a2 (satisfies part of constraint 4)

Actions for p2:

9. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2

10. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

11. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 → t2 in l2_1

12. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 → p2 in l2_1

13. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 → a2 has p1 and p2? Or does each load action only handle one package? The problem doesn't say that a truck or airplane can carry multiple packages, but assuming they can, unless specified otherwise.

Assuming airplanes can carry multiple packages, then step 13 loads p2 into a2, which already has p1. Then:

14. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

15. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 → p2 in l1_1

16. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 → p1 in l1_1

17. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 → t1 is in l1_1 (from step 3)

18. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

19. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 → p2 in l1_4 (constraint 4 satisfied when p2 is in l1_4 and p1 was in a2 during step 8-14. But wait, in step 14, a2 flies to l1_1, so p1 is in a2 during the flight, but after unloading in step 16, p1 is no longer in a2. So the state where p2 is in l1_4 and p1 is in a2 must occur at the same time. 

Ah, here's a problem. Step 19 unloads p2 into l1_4, but by that time, p1 has been unloaded from a2 in step 16. So p1 is no longer in a2 when p2 is in l1_4. Therefore, constraint 4 is not satisfied.

So we need to have a state where both p2 is in l1_4 and p1 is in a2. 

Let's adjust the plan:

After step 14 (a2 is in l1_1 with p1 and p2), we need to unload p2 first and then p1.

But to have p1 still in a2 when p2 is in l1_4:

- Fly a2 to l1_1 (step 14).

- Unload p2 (step 15), leaving p1 in a2.

- Then, while p1 is still in a2, move p2 to l1_4.

So steps:

14. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

15. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 → p2 in l1_1, a2 still has p1

16. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

17. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

18. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 → now p2 is in l1_4, and p1 is still in a2 (since we haven't unloaded him yet)

This satisfies constraint 4: p2 in l1_4 and p1 in a2 (step 18).

Then, continue:

19. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 → p1 in l1_1

20. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4 → wait, t1 is in l1_4 after step 17.

No, after step 17, t1 is in l1_4. So to load p1 into t1, p1 must be in l1_4. But p1 is in l1_1 after step 19. So this is not possible. So need to adjust.

After step 18, p1 is still in a2 (which is in l1_1). To move p1 to l1_5:

19. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 → p1 in l1_1

20. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 → t1 is in l1_4, so need to drive back.

Wait, t1 is in l1_4 after step 17. So need to drive t1 back to l1_1:

19. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1

20. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

21. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1

22. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 → goal achieved.

For p2, after step 18 (p2 in l1_4), need to return to l2_2:

23. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 → t1 is in l1_1 after step 19, no. So t1 is in l1_4 after step 17, then driven to l1_1 in step 19. So after step 18, t1 is in l1_4. So step 19 is drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1. So before that, in step 18, p2 is in l1_4. To move p2 back:

23. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (before driving to l1_1)

But t1 is in l1_4 after step 17. So after step 18 (unload p2), t1 is in l1_4. So step 19: load p2 into t1:

19. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

20. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1

21. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

22. loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

23. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1

24. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

25. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 → t2 is in l2_1 after step 11.

26. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2

27. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 → goal achieved.

Meanwhile, steps for p1 after step 22:

But step 22 is unload p1 into l1_5 (goal achieved).

This is getting very long. The total steps are around 27, which is not optimal. There must be a smarter way.

Alternative approach: Find the minimal steps that satisfy all constraints.

The main goal is to get p1 to l1_5. Constraints:

1. p1 is in l1_2 initially (satisfied).

2. After initial state, p1 must go to l1_1 or l2_3.

3. At some state, p1 in a1 or p2 in l2_3.

4. At some state, p2 in l1_4 and p1 in a2.

To satisfy constraint 2, p1 must move to l1_1 or l2_3. Let's choose l1_1.

To satisfy constraint 3, perhaps have p1 in a1.

To satisfy constraint 4, need to move p2 to l1_4 and p1 to a2.

So steps:

1. Move p1 to l1_1 (constraint 2).

   a. Drive t1 to l1_2, load p1, drive to l1_1, unload.

2. Load p1 into a1 (constraint 3).

3. Unload p1 back into l1_1.

4. Move p1 to l1_5 via truck.

But need to also handle constraint 4.

To satisfy constraint 4:

5. Move p2 to l1_4 and p1 to a2.

So for p2:

   a. Drive t2 to l2_2, load p2, drive to l2_1.

   b. Load into a2, fly to l1_1, unload.

   c. Load into t1, drive to l1_4, unload.

For p1 to be in a2:

   d. After step 1, p1 is in l1_1. Load into a2 (but a2 is in l2_1). So need to fly a2 to l1_1.

But a2 starts in l2_1. So:

   e. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.

   f. Load p1 into a2.

So steps:

5. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

6. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

Now, p1 is in a2 (satisfies part of constraint 4).

For p2:

7. loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (if a2 is here, but p2 is not in l1_1 yet. So need to bring p2 to l1_1 first).

This is getting tangled. Let's outline the steps:

Main plan:

For p1:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1

2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2

3. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 → p1 in l1_1 (constraint 2)

4. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 → constraint 3 satisfied

5. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 → optional, but not needed if we just need to satisfy that p1 is in a1 at some point.

6. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 → move a1 to l2_1

7. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 → p1 in l2_1

8. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 → p1 in a2 (now a2 is in l2_1)

For p2:

9. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2

10. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

11. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2

12. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 → p2 in l2_1

13. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 → a2 now has p1 and p2

14. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 → a2 in l1_1

15. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 → p2 in l1_1, p1 still in a2

16. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 → t1 is in l1_1 (from step 3)

17. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

18. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 → p2 in l1_4 (constraint 4: p2 in l1_4 and p1 in a2 (still in a2 after step 15? No, after step 15, p2 is unloaded, so a2 now has p1. So when p2 is in l1_4 (step 18), p1 is in a2 (which is in l1_1 after step 14). So yes, constraint 4 is satisfied here.

Then, to return p2 to l2_2:

19. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

20. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1

21. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

22. loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

23. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1

24. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

25. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 → t2 is in l2_1 (from step 11)

26. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2

27. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 → goal achieved.

For p1:

After step 18, p1 is still in a2 (in l1_1). To move to l1_5:

28. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

29. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

30. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1

31. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 → goal achieved.

This is a total of 31 steps, which is not optimal. There must be a shorter way.

Perhaps combining steps. For example, after step 18, p2 is in l1_4 and p1 is in a2. Then, instead of moving p2 back, perhaps fly a2 (with p1) to l1_5's airport, but l1_5 is not an airport. So can't do that. Alternatively, unload p1 from a2 into l1_1, then use truck to move to l1_5.

But this still requires steps.

Alternatively, after step 18, unload p1 from a2 into l1_1, load into t1, drive to l1_5.

But steps would be:

28. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

29. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

30. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1

31. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 → goal.

Meanwhile, moving p2 back:

19. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 → t1 is in l1_1 after step 20. Wait, t1 is in l1_4 after step 17. So step 19: load p2 into t1 in l1_4.

20. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1

21. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

22. loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

23. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1

24. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

25. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

26. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2

27. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 → goal.

This is still 27 steps.

But the problem requires an optimal plan. This seems too long. Maybe there's a way to satisfy constraints without moving p2 all the way to l1_4.

Wait, the fourth constraint requires that p2 is in l1_4 and p1 is in a2. So perhaps we can load p2 into a2 and fly to l1_4's airport. But l1_4 is not an airport. So to get p2 to l1_4, must use a truck in c1. So the steps are necessary.

Alternatively, perhaps the fourth constraint can be satisfied earlier. For example, when p2 is loaded into a2 and p1 is in a2 at the same time. But the constraint requires p2 to be in l1_4 and p1 in a2. So they must be in those positions simultaneously.

This seems unavoidable to have many steps. But perhaps the optimal plan is this long. However, I might be missing a more efficient sequence.

Alternative approach:

Let's try to satisfy constraint 4 first.

Steps:

1. Move p1 to l1_1 (to satisfy constraint 2).

2. Load p1 into a1 and fly to l2_1.

3. Unload p1 into l2_1, load into a2.

4. Fly a2 to l1_1 (now p1 is in a2).

5. Move p2 to l2_1, load into a2, fly to l1_1.

6. Unload p2 into l1_1, load into truck t1, drive to l1_4. Now p2 is in l1_4 and p1 is in a2. This satisfies constraint 4.

Then, return p2 to l2_2 and move p1 to l1_5.

This approach reduces steps. Let's outline:

Steps:

For p1:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1

2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2

3. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 → p1 in l1_1

4. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 → a1 in l2_1

6. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 → p1 in l2_1

7. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 → p1 in a2 (constraint 4 part)

For p2:

8. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2

9. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

10. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 → t2 in l2_1

11. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 → p2 in l2_1

12. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 → a2 has p1 and p2

13. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 → a2 in l1_1

14. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 → p2 in l1_1, p1 still in a2

15. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 → t1 is in l1_1 (from step 3)

16. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

17. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 → p2 in l1_4, p1 in a2 (constraint 4 satisfied)

Now, return p2:

18. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

19. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1

20. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

21. loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

22. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1

23. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

24. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

25. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2

26. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 → goal

For p1:

After step 17, p1 is in a2 (l1_1). 

27. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

28. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

29. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1

30. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 → goal

This is 30 steps. Still too long. 

But perhaps there's a way to overlap steps. For example, after step 17 (p2 in l1_4, p1 in a2), instead of returning p2 immediately, first move p1 to l1_5.

But how?

After step 17:

- p1 is in a2 (l1_1).

So:

18. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 → p1 in l1_1

19. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 → t1 is in l1_4 (from step 16). So need to drive t1 back.

20. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1

21. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

22. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1

23. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 → goal achieved.

Meanwhile, for p2:

24. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 → t1 is now in l1_1 after step 20. So this is not possible. 

This is getting too complex. Given the time constraints, perhaps the optimal plan requires at least 20 steps, but I might have to present the shortest possible plan that satisfies all constraints. However, I'm not sure. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Another idea: Use the fourth constraint to satisfy the third constraint. For example, if p1 is in a2 (which is required for constraint 4), then if a2 is an airplane, then p1 being in a2 doesn't satisfy the third constraint (third constraint is p1 in a1 or p2 in l2_3). But if during the fourth constraint's state, p1 is in a2, that doesn't help with the third constraint. So third constraint must be addressed separately.

Wait, the third constraint requires that at some state, either p1 is in a1 or p2 is in l2_3. If during the plan, p1 is loaded into a1, then that satisfies the third constraint. So perhaps we can load p1 into a1 and then unload immediately, adding two steps.

So returning to the initial plan for p1, but adding steps to load into a1:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1

2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2

3. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1

4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

5. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 → satisfies third constraint

6. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

7. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

8. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1

9. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 → goal

This plan is 9 steps but doesn't satisfy the fourth constraint. So need to add steps for that.

To satisfy the fourth constraint:

At some state, p2 in l1_4 and p1 in a2.

So during the plan, need to move p2 to l1_4 and p1 to a2.

But in the current plan, p1 is moved via truck, so need to add steps to move p1 to a2 and p2 to l1_4.

This will increase the steps significantly.

Perhaps the minimal plan would be around 15-20 steps. Given the time I've spent and the complexity, I'll proceed to outline the plan based on the previous steps, even if it's long, ensuring all constraints are met.
