Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. So, the goal is to get package p1 to l2_4 and p2 to l1_5. But there are several constraints to satisfy. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the initial state: p1 is in l1_4 (city c1), and p2 is in l2_4 (city c2). Trucks t1 is in l1_5, t2 in l2_5. Airplanes a1 is in l1_1 (airport in c1), a2 in l2_1 (airport in c2). 

Constraints:
1. At some point, p1 must be in l1_4. Wait, initially it's already there. So maybe that's automatically satisfied? But the problem says "must hold in at least one state". Since the initial state has p1 in l1_4, maybe that's already met. Hmm, but I need to check if the constraints are about the trajectory of the plan. If the initial state counts, then constraint 1 is satisfied. But perhaps the problem wants the plan to pass through that state again. But the initial state is part of the problem, so maybe it's okay. Let's note that.

2. If p1 is in l1_4 in some state s, then p2 must be in l2_3 or l1_2 either in s or after. Since the initial state has p1 in l1_4, we need to ensure that either in the initial state or after, p2 is in l2_3 or l1_2. But initially, p2 is in l2_4. So after the initial state, we need to have p2 reach l2_3 or l1_2 at some point. So maybe moving p2 to l2_3 first.

3. At some state, both p1 is in l2_3 and p2 in l1_4. That's a tricky one. So we need to have a step where both are in those locations. 

4. At some state, p2 is in a1. So a1 is the airplane in c1's airport l1_1. So p2 needs to be loaded into a1 at some point.

So the plan needs to ensure all these constraints. Let's outline the steps.

First, the goal is to get p1 to l2_4 (in c2) and p2 to l1_5 (in c1). Since they are in different cities, we need to use airplanes to transport between cities. So probably, we need to move p1 from c1 to c2 via airplane a1 or a2, and p2 from c2 to c1 via airplane a1 or a2.

Let's think about p1's path. p1 starts in l1_4 (c1). To get to l2_4 (c2), it needs to go to an airport in c1 (l1_1), fly to c2's airport (l2_1), then be transported via truck to l2_4.

Similarly, p2 starts in l2_4 (c2). Needs to go to l1_5 (c1). So p2 would go to l2_1 (airport in c2), fly to l1_1, then via truck to l1_5.

But there are constraints to satisfy. Let's tackle them one by one.

Constraint 3: At some point, p1 is in l2_3 and p2 in l1_4. So p1 needs to be moved to l2_3 (which is in c2), and p2 to l1_4 (c1). How can that happen? Maybe during their transportation paths. Let's see.

Constraint 4: p2 must be in a1 at some point. a1 is in c1's airport l1_1. So p2 needs to be loaded into a1. But a1 starts in l1_1, so perhaps p2 is flown to l1_1 via another airplane (like a2?), but how? Wait, airplanes can fly between airports. So a2 is in l2_1. If we fly a2 to l1_1, then load p2 into a2, but that's not a1. Wait, no. To get p2 into a1, a1 must be in the same location as p2. So perhaps p2 is brought to l1_1, then loaded into a1. But how does p2 get to l1_1? It would need to be flown from c2 to c1 via an airplane. Let's say we use a2 to fly p2 from l2_1 to l1_1, but then a2 is in l1_1. Then, to load p2 into a1, which is already in l1_1, we can load it into a1. So steps for that: p2 is in l2_4, loaded into a truck (t2), driven to l2_1 (airport), loaded onto a2, flown to l1_1, unloaded into l1_1, then loaded into a1. Then perhaps a1 can fly somewhere else? But the goal is to get p2 to l1_5. So after being in a1, maybe unload it in l1_1, then load into a truck (t1) to drive to l1_5.

But that seems complicated. Let's map out possible steps.

First, for p1:

1. Move p1 from l1_4 to l1_1 (airport) using truck t1. But t1 is initially at l1_5. So first, drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_4. Wait, but how? The cities are c1 and c2. The locations in c1 are l1_1, l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5. So t1 is in l1_5. To get to l1_4, drive through c1's locations. So drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_4. Then load p1 into t1. Then drive t1 to l1_1 (the airport). Then unload p1 at l1_1. Then load it onto airplane a1 (since a1 is at l1_1). Then fly a1 to l2_1 (c2's airport). Then unload p1 there. Then load onto truck t2 (which is in l2_5; need to drive t2 to l2_1). Wait, t2 is initially in l2_5. So drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1. Then load p1 into t2, drive to l2_4, unload. That gets p1 to l2_4.

For p2:

Start in l2_4. Need to get to l1_5. So similar path: move to l2_1 via truck t2 (but t2 is in l2_5 initially). So drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_4, load p2, drive to l2_1. Then load onto airplane a2 (which is at l2_1). Fly a2 to l1_1. Unload p2. Then load into truck t1 (drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_5? Wait, t1 is initially at l1_5, but after moving to l1_4 and l1_1 for p1's transport, where is t1? Let's track.

Wait, for p1's path: t1 starts at l1_5. Drive to l1_4 (drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1). Then load p1 into t1. Then drive to l1_1. So after that, t1 is at l1_1. Then, after unloading p1 at l1_1, t1 is still there. So to move p2 from l1_1 (after being flown there) to l1_5, need to drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_5, but that's possible. So steps for p2: load into a2, fly to l1_1, unload, then load into t1 (if t1 is at l1_1), drive t1 to l1_5, unload.

But wait, p2's goal is l1_5. So that works. But need to consider the constraints.

Now, let's check constraints.

Constraint 1: p1 is in l1_4. That's the initial state, so already satisfied. But during the plan, maybe p1 is moved, but the initial state counts as a state where the condition holds. So constraint 1 is satisfied.

Constraint 2: If p1 is in l1_4 (which is true in the initial state), then p2 must be in l2_3 or l1_2 at or after that state. Initially, p2 is in l2_4. So after the initial state, we need to have p2 reach l2_3 or l1_2 at some point. How?

In the plan for p2, after being in l2_4, we drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_4 (to pick up p2). Then drive to l2_1. But along the way, could we stop at l2_3? Let's see: l2_5 is in c2. The locations in c2 are l2_1, l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5. So driving from l2_5 to l2_4 would go through intermediate locations? Or are the locations connected directly? The drivetruck action can move between any two locations in the same city. So t2 can drive from l2_5 to l2_4 directly. But if we need to pass through l2_3, perhaps we need to route that way. But maybe to satisfy the constraint, during p2's transportation, we can have t2 drive through l2_3. For example, after loading p2 into t2 at l2_4, drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_3, then to l2_1. That way, when p2 is in l2_3 (in t2), then when unloading there, but that would change the plan. Alternatively, maybe we can unload p2 in l2_3 temporarily. But that might complicate the plan. Wait, the constraint says that if p1 is in l1_4 (which is the initial state), then p2 must be in l2_3 or l1_2 in s or after. So in the initial state, p1 is in l1_4, and p2 is in l2_4. So after the initial state, we need to get p2 to l2_3 or l1_2 at some point. So perhaps when moving p2 from l2_4 to l2_1 via truck, we can have a stop at l2_3. Let's adjust the plan:

For p2: load into t2 at l2_4, drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_3, unload p2 (so p2 is now in l2_3), then load again into t2, drive to l2_1. That way, in the state after unloading at l2_3, p2 is in l2_3. This satisfies the second constraint because after the initial state (where p1 is in l1_4), p2 reaches l2_3. However, this adds steps. But the problem requires the plan to be optimal (shortest possible). So maybe there's a way to have p2 in l2_3 or l1_2 without adding steps. Alternatively, perhaps during the transportation of p2 to the airport, we can pass through l2_3. But in the drivetruck action, the truck can go directly from l2_4 to l2_1, but maybe not. Wait, the drivetruck action can move between any two locations in the same city. So t2 can drive from l2_4 to l2_1 directly. But to get p2 to l2_3, we need to drive there. So maybe a detour:

Original plan for p2: drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_4 (to pick up p2). Wait, no. Initially, t2 is in l2_5. p2 is in l2_4. So first, drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_4. Then load p2 into t2. Then drive t2 to l2_1. But if we drive from l2_4 to l2_3, then to l2_1, that would require two drive actions. So:

Action1: drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2 (t2 moves to l2_4)
Action2: loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
Action3: drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2 (p2 is in t2)
Action4: unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (now p2 is in l2_3)
Action5: loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
Action6: drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
Action7: unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
Then load into airplane a2 and fly to l1_1.

But this adds several steps. However, the constraint requires that after the initial state (where p1 is in l1_4), p2 is in l2_3 or l1_2 at some point. So by having p2 in l2_3 in step4, this satisfies the second constraint. But this adds steps, making the plan longer. But maybe there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, maybe when moving p1, we can have it pass through l1_4 again. Wait, but p1 starts in l1_4. To get it to l1_1, we load it into t1, drive to l1_1. So the initial state is the only time p1 is in l1_4. Therefore, the constraint about p1 being in l1_4 is already satisfied in the initial state, and the second constraint requires that after that, p2 must be in l2_3 or l1_2. So any time after the initial state, p2 needs to reach one of those locations. So perhaps during p2's transportation, we can have it go through l2_3 or l1_2.

Wait, l1_2 is in c1. So if p2 is in l1_2, that's in c1. But p2 starts in c2. To get to l1_2, it needs to be transported to c1 first. But that's part of the plan. So maybe during the process of moving p2 to c1, after being flown to l1_1 (airport), we can drive it to l1_2, then to l1_5. But that would add steps. Let's see:

After flying p2 to l1_1 (using airplane a2), unload it there. Then load into truck t1 (which is at l1_1 after moving p1). Then drive t1 to l1_2, unload p2 there (satisfying the l1_2 condition), then load again into t1, drive to l1_5. This way, p2 is in l1_2 at some point, satisfying the second constraint. This might be better because it's part of the transportation path. So this would add a couple of steps but avoids having to go through l2_3.

So, which option is better? Let's compare:

Option 1: Take p2 through l2_3. This requires driving t2 from l2_4 to l2_3, then to l2_1. That's two drive actions (l2_4 to l2_3, then l2_3 to l2_1). Plus loading and unloading.

Option 2: Take p2 through l1_2. This requires after flying to l1_1, drive to l1_2, unload, then drive to l1_5. So two drive actions (l1_1 to l1_2, l1_2 to l1_5), plus loading and unloading.

Which is shorter? Let's see:

Option 1 for p2:

- Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_4 (1)
- Load p2 into t2 (2)
- Drive to l2_3 (3)
- Unload p2 (4) [satisfies constraint]
- Load p2 into t2 (5)
- Drive to l2_1 (6)
- Unload (7)
- Load into a2 (8)
- Fly to l1_1 (9)
- Unload (10)
- Load into t1 (11)
- Drive to l1_5 (12)
- Unload (13)

Option 2 for p2:

- Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_4 (1)
- Load p2 into t2 (2)
- Drive to l2_1 (3)
- Unload (4)
- Load into a2 (5)
- Fly to l1_1 (6)
- Unload (7)
- Load into t1 (8)
- Drive to l1_2 (9)
- Unload (10) [satisfies constraint]
- Load into t1 (11)
- Drive to l1_5 (12)
- Unload (13)

Both options have 13 steps. But perhaps there's a way to combine steps.

Wait, the third constraint requires that at some state, p1 is in l2_3 and p2 in l1_4. How can that happen? Because p1's path is from l1_4 to l1_1, then flown to l2_1, then driven to l2_4. So p1 is never in l2_3. So we need to adjust the plan to make p1 go through l2_3. That complicates things.

Similarly, p2's path needs to go through l1_4. Wait, p2's goal is l1_5. So how can p2 be in l1_4? Let's see. l1_4 is in c1, where p1 started. So maybe during the transportation of p2 to l1_5, we can have a detour to l1_4. For example, after flying to l1_1, drive t1 to l1_4, unload p2 there (satisfying part of constraint3), then load again and drive to l1_5. But then p2 would be in l1_4 at some point. But also, p1 needs to be in l2_3. So how?

Wait, p1's path is l1_4 -> l1_1 (by truck), then flown to l2_1. Then driven to l2_4. So to get p1 to l2_3, we need to have it driven from l2_1 to l2_3. But l2_1 is an airport. So maybe after flying p1 to l2_1, load it into t2 (which is in l2_1 after driving from l2_5 to l2_4 to pick up p2), then drive t2 to l2_3, unload p1 there (now p1 is in l2_3), then drive to l2_4. But that would require:

For p1:

- Fly to l2_1, unload.
- Load into t2 (which is at l2_1).
- Drive t2 to l2_3, unload p1 (now p1 is in l2_3).
- Then load again into t2, drive to l2_4, unload.

But then p1 is in l2_3, satisfying part of constraint3. For p2 to be in l1_4: after being flown to l1_1, drive to l1_4, unload there (so p2 is in l1_4), then load again and drive to l1_5. So this would satisfy constraint3 (p1 in l2_3 and p2 in l1_4). But this adds steps:

For p1:

After arriving at l2_1 (unloaded from a1), load into t2, drive to l2_3, unload (p1 in l2_3), then load again into t2, drive to l2_4, unload.

For p2:

After arriving at l1_1 (unloaded from a2), load into t1, drive to l1_4, unload (p2 in l1_4), then load again, drive to l1_5, unload.

This way, during the plan, p1 is in l2_3 and p2 in l1_4 at the same time? Or at different times? The constraint says that there exists a state where both are true. So perhaps they don't have to be simultaneous. Wait, the third constraint says: "The following conditions are all true: p1 in l2_3 and p2 in l1_4". So they must be true in the same state. That's challenging. So the plan must have a state where both are true. So how can that happen?

So we need to have both p1 in l2_3 and p2 in l1_4 at the same time. Let's think:

If p1 is in l2_3 (in c2), that means after being flown to l2_1, then driven to l2_3. And p2 is in l1_4 (in c1), which requires p2 to be there after being transported to c1. 

So possible steps:

1. Transport p1 to l2_3 via truck t2.
2. Transport p2 to l1_4 via truck t1.

But how to coordinate these steps so that they overlap in time.

Alternatively, during p1's transportation to l2_3, p2 is being moved to l1_4. Let's outline:

For p1:

- fly from l1_1 to l2_1 (a1)
- unload into l2_1
- load into t2 (which is at l2_1)
- drive t2 to l2_3, unload p1 (now p1 is in l2_3)
- then drive t2 to l2_4, load p1, unload there.

For p2:

- fly from l2_1 to l1_1 (a2)
- unload into l1_1
- load into t1 (which is at l1_1)
- drive t1 to l1_4, unload p2 (now p2 is in l1_4)
- then drive to l1_5, unload.

Now, the state after p1 is unloaded at l2_3 and p2 is unloaded at l1_4 would have both conditions true. So that's one state where both are true. That satisfies constraint3. But this requires additional steps.

But this plan may have more steps than necessary. Let's see:

For p1:

Original steps (without constraint3):

loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4 (after driving t1 to l1_4)

drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1

unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (assuming t2 is there)

drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2

unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

But to satisfy constraint3, we need to add steps where p1 is in l2_3. So after flying to l2_1, instead of driving directly to l2_4, drive to l2_3, unload, then drive to l2_4. Similarly for p2.

So modified steps for p1:

After unloading from a1 in l2_1:

loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2

unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (now p1 is in l2_3)

loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2

unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

Similarly, for p2:

After unloading from a2 in l1_1:

loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (now p2 is in l1_4)

loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1

unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

This way, during the steps where p1 is in l2_3 and p2 is in l1_4, those states are separate. Wait, but the constraint requires both to be true in the same state. So if p1 is unloaded in l2_3 and remains there until loaded again, and p2 is unloaded in l1_4 and remains there until loaded again, then there is a time when p1 is in l2_3 and p2 is in l1_4. So those two unload actions happen in different steps, but their effects persist until the next action that moves them. So if p1 is unloaded in l2_3 (step A), and p2 is unloaded in l1_4 (step B), then between step A and the next step where p1 is loaded again, and between step B and the next step where p2 is loaded again, their locations are l2_3 and l1_4 respectively. So if these two time intervals overlap, then there exists a state where both are true.

So if step A (unload p1 in l2_3) happens before step B (unload p2 in l1_4), and after step B, p2 is loaded again, then between step B and when p2 is loaded again, p1 is still in l2_3. So during that time, both are true. Alternatively, if step B happens before step A, similar overlap.

So the plan would have a state where both are true. Thus, the third constraint is satisfied.

Now, constraint4: p2 must be in a1 (airplane in c1's airport l1_1). To do this, p2 needs to be loaded into a1. Since a1 starts in l1_1, p2 must be brought to l1_1 and then loaded into a1. So in the plan for p2, after being flown to l1_1 via a2 (which lands at l1_1), we unload p2 into l1_1. Then, we can load p2 into a1 (which is at l1_1). Then, perhaps unload it again and proceed to transport via truck. So steps:

After flying a2 to l1_1 with p2:

unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (now p2 is in a1)

unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (or do we need to keep it in a1? Wait, the constraint is that p2 is in a1 at some state. So loading it into a1 and then immediately unloading would satisfy the constraint, as during the load step, p2 is in a1. But the constraint says "holds in at least one state". So the state after loading p2 into a1 would have p2 in a1, satisfying constraint4. Then we can unload it and proceed.

So the steps for p2 would be:

...

flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (now p2 is in a1, satisfying constraint4)

unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1

unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

This way, p2 is loaded into a1, satisfying constraint4.

Putting it all together, let's outline the full plan:

For p1:

1. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_4 (to pick up p1).
2. Load p1 into t1.
3. Drive t1 to l1_1 (airport).
4. Unload p1 into l1_1.
5. Load p1 into a1.
6. Fly a1 to l2_1.
7. Unload p1 into l2_1.
8. Load p1 into t2 (assuming t2 is driven to l2_1).
9. Drive t2 to l2_3.
10. Unload p1 into l2_3 (satisfies part of constraint3).
11. Load p1 into t2.
12. Drive t2 to l2_4.
13. Unload p1 into l2_4 (goal).

For p2:

1. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_4 (to pick up p2).
2. Load p2 into t2.
3. Drive t2 to l2_1 (airport).
4. Unload p2 into l2_1.
5. Load p2 into a2.
6. Fly a2 to l1_1.
7. Unload p2 into l1_1.
8. Load p2 into a1 (constraint4 satisfied here).
9. Unload p2 into l1_1.
10. Load p2 into t1.
11. Drive t1 to l1_4.
12. Unload p2 into l1_4 (part of constraint3).
13. Load p2 into t1.
14. Drive t1 to l1_5.
15. Unload p2 into l1_5 (goal).

But we need to check the ordering and ensure that all actions are possible. For example, t2 is used for both p1 and p2. So we need to sequence their usage properly.

Wait, t2 is initially in l2_5. For p2's transportation:

- Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_4 (action1 for p2).
- Load p2 into t2 (action2 for p2).
- Drive t2 to l2_1 (action3 for p2).
- Unload p2 (action4 for p2).

Then, t2 is in l2_1. Later, for p1's transportation after being flown to l2_1:

- Load p1 into t2 (action8 for p1).
- Drive t2 to l2_3 (action9 for p1).
- Unload p1 (action10 for p1).
- Load p1 again (action11).
- Drive to l2_4 (action12).
- Unload (action13).

But after p2 is done using t2 (action4 for p2), t2 is in l2_1. So p1 can use t2 from there. So the sequence is:

p2 uses t2 first, then p1 uses it. So the steps for p2 must come before p1's steps that use t2.

But wait, the plan needs to interleave actions for p1 and p2. Let's try to order all steps chronologically:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1 (move t1 to p1's location)
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
3. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 (move to airport)
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
5. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
6. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (a1 arrives at l2_1)
7. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2 (move t2 to p2's location)
8. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
9. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2 (move to airport)
10. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
11. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
12. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (a2 arrives at l1_1)
13. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 (after flying, a1 is in l2_1; p1 is in a1)
14. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (t2 is in l2_1 after step9)
15. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2 (move towards l2_4)
16. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (p1 in l2_3)
17. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2 (continue to l2_4)
18. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (p1 reaches goal)
19. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (p2 is unloaded from a2)
20. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (p2 loaded into a1; constraint4 met)
21. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
22. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (t1 is in l1_1 after step3)
23. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1 (move towards l1_5)
24. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (p2 in l1_4; constraint3 part)
25. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1 (move to goal)
26. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 (p2 reaches goal)

But need to check dependencies and ensure that actions are possible at each step. Let's verify:

- Step1: t1 starts at l1_5, moves to l1_4. Correct.
- Step2: load p1 into t1 at l1_4. Yes.
- Step3: drive t1 to l1_1. Correct.
- Step4: unload p1 into l1_1. Now p1 is in l1_1.
- Step5: load p1 into a1 (which is at l1_1). Yes.
- Step6: fly a1 to l2_1. Now a1 is at l2_1, p1 is inside.
- Step7: drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_4. Correct.
- Step8: load p2 into t2 at l2_4.
- Step9: drive t2 to l2_1. Now t2 is at l2_1.
- Step10: unload p2 into l2_1.
- Step11: load p2 into a2 (which is at l2_1 initially). Wait, a2 starts at l2_1. So yes.
- Step12: fly a2 to l1_1. Now a2 is at l1_1, p2 inside.
- Step13: unload p1 from a1 (which is at l2_1). Yes, after step6, a1 is at l2_1. So step13: unload p1 from a1 into l2_1. Now p1 is in l2_1.
- Step14: load p1 into t2 (which is at l2_1 after step9). Correct.
- Step15: drive t2 to l2_3.
- Step16: unload p1 there. Now p1 is in l2_3.
- Step17: drive t2 to l2_4.
- Step18: unload p1 into l2_4 (goal).
- Step19: unload p2 from a2 (which is at l1_1 after step12). Now p2 is in l1_1.
- Step20: load p2 into a1 (which is at l2_1 now? Wait, no. After step6, a1 flew to l2_1. So a1 is at l2_1. But step19 is unloading a2 at l1_1. So p2 is in l1_1. To load into a1, a1 must be at l1_1. But a1 is at l2_1. This is a problem. So this approach won't work.

Ah, here's a mistake. After step6, a1 is at l2_1. So when we try to load p2 into a1 at l1_1 (step20), a1 is not there. So we can't load p2 into a1 at l1_1 unless a1 is there. So this approach is invalid.

So how can p2 be loaded into a1? We need a1 to be at l1_1. But after step6, a1 is at l2_1. So to get a1 back to l1_1, we need to fly it back. But that would take more steps. Let's adjust:

After step6 (fly a1 to l2_1), after unloading p1 (step13), perhaps fly a1 back to l1_1. But that would add steps. Let's see:

Revised steps:

...

6. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (now a1 is at l2_1)
7. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2
8. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
9. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2 (t2 is at l2_1)
10. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
11. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
12. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (a2 arrives at l1_1)
13. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 (p1 is in l2_1)
14. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1 (fly a1 back to l1_1)
15. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (now a1 is at l1_1)
...

But this adds step14. Then, after unloading p2 from a2 (step12), p2 is in l1_1. Then fly a1 back to l1_1, load p2 into a1. This would satisfy constraint4. But this adds steps, making the plan longer.

Alternatively, perhaps use a different airplane. But a2 is the one flying p2 to l1_1. To load p2 into a1, a1 must be at l1_1. So after step6, a1 is at l2_1. So after step6, we need to fly a1 back to l1_1 to load p2 into it. Let's see:

Steps after step6:

6. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (a1 at l2_1)
...
13. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 (p1 now in l2_1)
14. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1 (fly back to l1_1)
15. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (p2 is in l1_1 after step12)
...

So after step12, a2 is at l1_1, p2 is in a2. Then step12 is fly a2 to l1_1. Then unload p2 from a2 into l1_1 (step19). Then fly a1 back to l1_1 (step14), then load p2 into a1 (step15).

This would require:

After step12 (a2 arrives at l1_1):

13. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (p2 in l1_1)
14. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1 (a1 returns)
15. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (now p2 in a1)
16. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (optional)
...

But this adds steps. This makes the plan longer, but necessary to satisfy constraint4.

So integrating all this, the plan becomes:

For p1:

1. Drive t1 to l1_4.
2. Load p1.
3. Drive to l1_1.
4. Unload.
5. Load into a1.
6. Fly to l2_1.
7. Unload p1 into l2_1.
8. Fly a1 back to l1_1 (additional step).
9. Load p1 into t2 (t2 is at l2_1 from p2's steps).
10. Drive t2 to l2_3.
11. Unload p1.
12. Drive to l2_4.
13. Unload.

For p2:

1. Drive t2 to l2_4.
2. Load p2.
3. Drive to l2_1.
4. Unload.
5. Load into a2.
6. Fly to l1_1.
7. Unload.
8. Fly a1 back to l1_1 (step8 above).
9. Load p2 into a1.
10. Unload.
11. Load into t1.
12. Drive to l1_4.
13. Unload.
14. Drive to l1_5.
15. Unload.

But this is getting quite long. Let's try to outline the entire plan with all necessary steps, ensuring all constraints are met and the plan is valid.

Final Plan Outline:

Actions for p1:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
3. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
5. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
6. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
7. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

Actions for p2:

8. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2
9. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
10. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
11. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
12. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
13. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
14. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

Now, to satisfy constraint4 (p2 in a1), we need to load p2 into a1. But a1 is at l2_1 after step6. So we need to fly a1 back to l1_1:

15. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
16. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (constraint4 met here)
17. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

Then, move p2 to l1_5:

18. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (t1 is at l1_1 after step3)
19. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
20. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (constraint3 part)
21. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
22. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1
23. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

Meanwhile, handle p1's remaining steps:

After step7 (p1 in l2_1), need to move it to l2_3 and then l2_4.

But t2 is at l2_1 after step10:

24. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (t2 is at l2_1)
25. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
26. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (constraint3 part)
27. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
28. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
29. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (p1's goal)

Now, checking constraints:

- constraint1: p1 is in l1_4 initially, satisfied.
- constraint2: after initial state, p2 must be in l2_3 or l1_2. In step20, p2 is in l1_4, which is not one of those. However, during p2's transportation, after step10, p2 is in l2_1. To satisfy constraint2, we need p2 to be in l2_3 or l1_2. But in the current plan, p2 is in l2_1, then flown to l1_1. So perhaps we need to adjust p2's path to pass through l2_3 or l1_2.

Wait, in the current plan, after step9 (loading p2 into t2), step10 drives from l2_4 to l2_1. To pass through l2_3, we can drive through l2_3:

Revised steps for p2:

8. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2
9. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
10. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2 (unload here to satisfy constraint2)
11. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
12. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
13. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
14. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
15. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
16. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
17. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
18. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1 (a1 returns)
19. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (constraint4)
20. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
21. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
22. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
23. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (constraint3)
24. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
25. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1
26. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

This way, during step11, p2 is unloaded in l2_3, satisfying constraint2. Then reloaded and driven to l2_1.

Now, let's integrate all steps and check for validity:

Full Plan Steps:

For p1:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
3. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
5. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
6. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
7. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

For p2:

8. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2
9. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
10. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2
11. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (p2 in l2_3, satisfying constraint2)
12. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
13. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
14. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
15. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
16. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
17. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
18. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1 (fly a1 back)
19. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (constraint4 met)
20. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
21. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
22. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
23. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (p2 in l1_4, part of constraint3)
24. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
25. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1
26. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

For p1 (continued):

27. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (t2 is at l2_1 after step13)
28. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
29. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (p1 in l2_3, part of constraint3)
30. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
31. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
32. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (p1's goal)

Now, check the constraints:

- Constraint1: p1 in l1_4 (initial state, satisfied).
- Constraint2: after initial state, p2 is in l2_3 (step11), satisfied.
- Constraint3: p1 in l2_3 and p2 in l1_4. The state after step23 (p2 in l1_4) and step29 (p1 in l2_3) must overlap. Between steps29 and30, p1 is in l2_3, and between steps23 and24, p2 is in l1_4. So there is a state where both are true (after step29 and before step30, assuming steps are executed in order). Thus, satisfied.
- Constraint4: p2 in a1 during step19.

This plan has 32 steps. But the problem requires an optimal plan with minimal length. However, this seems too long. Perhaps there's a way to optimize.

Alternative approach: Use a1 to transport p2 after returning to l1_1.

Wait, after step6 (a1 flies to l2_1 with p1), step7 unloads p1. Then, a1 can fly back to l1_1 (step18). Then, p2 is loaded into a1 (step19), satisfying constraint4.

But perhaps we can combine steps. For example, after flying a1 to l2_1, unload p1, then fly a1 back to l1_1 before p2 arrives there. But the timing depends on the order of actions.

Alternatively, since p2 needs to be in a1, and a1 is in l2_1, perhaps we can load p2 into a1 while it's in l2_1. But how? p2 is in l2_1 after step14. So if a1 is in l2_1, can we load p2 into a1 there?

Wait, step7 unloads p1 into l2_1. Then, step8 to step14 handle p2's movement to l2_1. Then, step15 loads p2 into a2 (which is in l2_1), then flown to l1_1. So if instead of loading into a2, we load into a1 (which is in l2_1 after step6), that would satisfy constraint4. Because a1 is in l2_1 at that time.

So revised plan for p2:

After p2 is unloaded into l2_1 (step14), load into a1 instead of a2. Then fly a1 to l1_1. But a1 is already in l2_1 (after step6). So steps:

For p2:

15. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (now p2 is in a1, satisfying constraint4)
16. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1 (now a1 is at l1_1 with p2)
17. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
...

This way, we avoid having to fly a1 back and forth. This saves steps and satisfies constraint4 when p2 is loaded into a1 in l2_1.

This seems more efficient. Let's outline:

Full Plan Steps:

For p1:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
3. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
5. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
6. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
7. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 (p1 in l2_1)

For p2:

8. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2
9. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
10. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2 (satisfy constraint2)
11. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
12. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
13. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
14. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
15. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (a1 is here after step6; constraint4)
16. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1 (now a1 returns to l1_1 with p2)
17. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
18. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (t1 is at l1_1 after step3)
19. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
20. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (constraint3 part)
21. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
22. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1
23. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

For p1:

24. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (t2 is at l2_1 after step13)
25. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
26. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (constraint3 part)
27. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
28. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
29. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

Now, checking constraints:

- Constraint1: p1 starts in l1_4, satisfied.
- Constraint2: p2 is in l2_3 at step11, satisfied.
- Constraint3: p1 in l2_3 (step26) and p2 in l1_4 (step20). These happen at different steps. Between steps26 and27, p1 is in l2_3. Between steps20 and21, p2 is in l1_4. So there is a state where both are true (after step26 and before step27, and after step20 and before step21). Therefore, satisfied.
- Constraint4: p2 is in a1 at step15, satisfied.

This plan has 29 steps. But maybe further optimization is possible. Let's see:

After p1 is in l2_1 (step7), can we load it into t2 and move directly to l2_4 without going through l2_3? But then how to satisfy constraint3 which requires p1 to be in l2_3.

Ah, right, constraint3 requires that at some state, both p1 is in l2_3 and p2 is in l1_4. So we need to ensure that in the plan, there's a state where both conditions hold. 

In the current plan, p1 is in l2_3 (step26) and p2 is in l1_4 (step20). These are two different states. The only way to have them both true in the same state is to have them overlap. For example, if p1 is in l2_3 and p2 is in l1_4 at the same time.

So in the current plan, after step20 (p2 in l1_4), and step26 (p1 in l2_3), the states would be:

After step20: p2 in l1_4.

After step26: p1 in l2_3.

But the state after step20 occurs before step24 (loading p1 into t2). So p1 is still in l2_1. So these two states don't overlap. Therefore, the plan doesn't satisfy constraint3.

Thus, the approach to move p1 to l2_3 and p2 to l1_4 in different steps doesn't work. We need them to be true in the same state.

This is a problem. So how to achieve that?

Perhaps, we need to synchronize their steps. For example, have p1 unloaded in l2_3 and p2 unloaded in l1_4 in the same step. But that's not possible unless both actions happen in parallel, which they can't in a sequential plan.

Alternatively, have one of the conditions persist until the other is achieved. For example, if p1 is unloaded in l2_3 and remains there until p2 is unloaded in l1_4. But in the plan, after p1 is unloaded in l2_3 (step26), it is loaded back into t2 (step27) and moved to l2_4. So the only time p1 is in l2_3 is between steps26 and27. Similarly, p2 is in l1_4 between steps20 and21. If these intervals don't overlap, the constraint isn't met.

So to satisfy constraint3, the intervals where p1 is in l2_3 and p2 is in l1_4 must overlap. Therefore, the unloading of p1 into l2_3 must occur after p2 is unloaded into l1_4, but before p2 is loaded again. Or vice versa.

Let's adjust the plan to have p2 unloaded into l1_4 first, then p1 unloaded into l2_3 while p2 is still there.

Revised plan steps:

For p2:

18. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
19. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
20. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (p2 in l1_4)
21. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
22. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1
23. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

For p1:

24. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
25. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
26. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (p1 in l2_3 while p2 is in l1_4)
27. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
28. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
29. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

Now, between steps20 and21, p2 is in l1_4. Between steps26 and27, p1 is in l2_3. If step26 occurs after step20, then during that time, both are true. So the plan would need to order the steps such that step20 (p2 in l1_4) happens before step26 (p1 in l2_3), and step21 (loading p2) happens after step26. 

So the sequence would be:

... steps1-17 (p2 is flown to l1_1, then loaded into t1 and driven to l1_4)

20. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (p2 in l1_4)

... steps24-26 for p1:

24. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
25. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
26. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (p1 in l2_3)

At this point, p2 is in l1_4 (from step20), and p1 is in l2_3 (from step26). So the state after step26 has both conditions true, satisfying constraint3.

Then, proceed to move p2 to l1_5:

21. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
22. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1
23. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

And p1 to l2_4:

27. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
28. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
29. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

This way, constraint3 is satisfied in the state after step26 and before step21.

Now, integrating all steps:

Final Plan:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
3. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
5. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
6. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
7. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
8. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2
9. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
10. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2
11. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (constraint2)
12. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
13. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
14. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
15. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (constraint4)
16. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
17. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
18. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
19. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
20. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (p2 in l1_4)
21. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
22. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
23. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (p1 in l2_3, constraint3)
24. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
25. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1
26. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 (p2's goal)
27. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
28. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
29. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (p1's goal)

Now, checking the constraints:

- Constraint1: p1 starts in l1_4, satisfied.
- Constraint2: p2 in l2_3 (step11), satisfied.
- Constraint3: after step23, p1 in l2_3 and after step20, p2 in l1_4. The state after step23 and before step24 has both true. So satisfied.
- Constraint4: p2 loaded into a1 at step15, satisfied.

This plan has 29 steps. But maybe there's a way to optimize further. For example, combining steps where possible.

Wait, step15 loads p2 into a1, then step16 flies a1 to l1_1. Then step17 unloads p2. This is correct.

After step7, p1 is in l2_1. Then step21 loads p1 into t2 (which is at l2_1 after step13).

But after step13, t2 is at l2_1. So step21 is valid.

This plan seems valid. Now, let's check for any missing steps or errors.

Additionally, the initial state lists "Package t1 is in location l1_5" — but t1 is a truck, so maybe that's a typo. Similarly for other packages. Wait, the problem states:

"The original state of the world is the following:
	"Package t1 is in location l1_5"
	"Package t2 is in location l2_5"
	"Package p1 is in location l1_4"
	"Package p2 is in location l2_4"
	"Package a1 is in location l1_1"
	"Package a2 is in location l2_1""

Wait, this can't be right. Because t1 and t2 are trucks, a1 and a2 are airplanes. So the original state must have:

Trucks t1 and t2 are in locations, not packages. Similarly for airplanes. So the original state likely has:

"Truck t1 is in location l1_5"

"Truck t2 is in location l2_5"

"Airplane a1 is in location l1_1"

"Airplane a2 is in location l2_1"

And packages p1, p2 are in their respective locations.

But the problem statement lists them as "Package t1...", which is probably a mistake. Assuming that's a typo, and the correct initial state has trucks and airplanes in their locations.

Assuming that, the initial state is:

- Trucks: t1 at l1_5, t2 at l2_5.
- Airplanes: a1 at l1_1, a2 at l2_1.
- Packages: p1 at l1_4, p2 at l2_4.

So the initial state is correct with trucks and airplanes in their respective locations.

Thus, the plan is valid.
