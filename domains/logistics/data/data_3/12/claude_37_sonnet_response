Let's break down the problem:

1. We have cities c1 and c2, each with multiple locations.
2. l1_1 is an airport in city c1, and l2_1 is an airport in city c2.
3. We have packages, trucks, and airplanes. 
4. The goal is to bring the package p1 to location l1_1.
5. Additional constraints:
   - p1 must be in airplane a2 at some point.
   - Before p1 is in a2, it must be in truck t1.
   - p1 must also be in airplane a1 at some point.

Now, let's analyze the initial state:
- Package p1 is in location l2_1 (the airport of city c2).
- Truck t1 is in location l1_7 (in city c1).
- Truck t2 is in location l2_3 (in city c2).
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (the airport of city c1).
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1 (the airport of city c2).

Let's devise a plan:

1. First, we need to get p1 into truck t1, but t1 is in city c1 and p1 is in city c2.
2. So, we need to use airplanes to transport p1 from city c2 to city c1.
3. Airplane a2 is already in location l2_1 where p1 is, so we can load p1 into a2.
4. We'll fly a2 to airport l1_1 in city c1.
5. At l1_1, we'll unload p1 from a2.
6. Now, we need to meet the constraint that p1 must be in t1 before being in a2. Since we've already put p1 in a2, we can't meet this constraint.

Let me rethink. The constraint says that if p1 is in a2 at some point, then there should be an earlier state where p1 is in t1. This means that before loading p1 into a2, it should have been in t1 at some point.

Revised plan:
1. Since p1 is in l2_1 and t1 is in l1_7, we need to get t1 to l2_1 or p1 to l1_7.
2. Since trucks can only move within cities, we can't drive t1 to l2_1. We need to use airplanes.
3. We can use airplane a1 (which is in l1_1) to transport p1 from l2_1 to l1_1.
4. From l1_1, we can use truck t1 to transport p1 to l1_7 and then back to l1_1.
5. Then, we can load p1 into a2 (which would have to be flown to l1_1 first).

But there's a problem: While a1 is in l1_1, p1 is in l2_1. We need to get a1 to l2_1. 

Actually, this is a bit complex. Let me step back and walk through the plan again with a clear sequence of actions:

1. Fly airplane a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
2. Load package p1 into airplane a1 at l2_1.
3. Fly airplane a1 from l2_1 back to l1_1.
4. Unload package p1 from airplane a1 at l1_1.
5. Drive truck t1 from l1_7 to l1_1.
6. Load package p1 into truck t1 at l1_1.
7. Drive truck t1 from l1_1 to any other location in city c1 (e.g., l1_2) and back to l1_1.
8. Unload package p1 from truck t1 at l1_1.
9. Fly airplane a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
10. Load package p1 into airplane a2 at l1_1.
11. Fly airplane a2 from l1_1 back to l2_1.
12. Unload package p1 from airplane a2 at l2_1.
13. Load package p1 back into airplane a1 at l2_1.
14. Fly airplane a1 from l2_1 to l1_1.
15. Unload package p1 from airplane a1 at l1_1.

That's a complex plan, but I think it satisfies all the constraints: p1 is in a1 at some point, p1 is in a2 at some point, and before p1 is in a2, it's in t1.

Actually, there might be a shorter plan. Let's see if we can simplify:

1. Fly airplane a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
2. Load package p1 into airplane a1 at l2_1.
3. Fly airplane a1 from l2_1 back to l1_1.
4. Unload package p1 from airplane a1 at l1_1.
5. Drive truck t1 from l1_7 to l1_1.
6. Load package p1 into truck t1 at l1_1.
7. Drive truck t1 from l1_1 back to l1_7.
8. Unload package p1 from truck t1 at l1_7.
9. Drive truck t1 from l1_7 back to l1_1.
10. Load package p1 into truck t1 at l1_7.
11. Drive truck t1 from l1_7 to l1_1.
12. Unload package p1 from truck t1 at l1_1.
13. Fly airplane a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
14. Load package p1 into airplane a2 at l1_1.
15. Unload package p1 from airplane a2 at l1_1.

Actually, steps 7-11 are a bit redundant. Let me refine again:

1. Fly airplane a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
2. Load package p1 into airplane a1 at l2_1.
3. Fly airplane a1 from l2_1 back to l1_1.
4. Unload package p1 from airplane a1 at l1_1.
5. Drive truck t1 from l1_7 to l1_1.
6. Load package p1 into truck t1 at l1_1.
7. Unload package p1 from truck t1 at l1_1.
8. Fly airplane a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
9. Load package p1 into airplane a2 at l1_1.
10. Unload package p1 from airplane a2 at l1_1.

Actually, this will work. I'm pretty sure the first requirement (p1 in a2 at some point) was a bit confusing. Let's double-check the constraints:

1. "Package p1 is in a2" must hold in at least one state. This means p1 must be in airplane a2 at some point.
2. If "Package p1 is in a2" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which "Package p1 is in t1" is true. This means that before p1 is in a2, it should have been in t1 at some point.
3. "Package p1 is in a1" must hold in at least one state. This means p1 must be in airplane a1 at some point.

Let me check my plan against these:
1. p1 is in a2 in step 9. Checked.
2. Before step 9, p1 is in t1 in step 6 and 7. Checked.
3. p1 is in a1 in steps 2 and 3. Checked.

So, the plan satisfies all the constraints. Let's just check once more to make sure we are satisfying the goal:
- The goal is to bring p1 to location l1_1.
- After step 10, p1 is in l1_1. Checked.

I'm also realizing now that there was some confusion in the initial state. The problem says:

"Package t1 is in location l1_7"
"Package t2 is in location l2_3"
"Package p1 is in location l2_1"
"Package a1 is in location l1_1"
"Package a2 is in location l2_1"

But t1, t2, a1, and a2 are not packages; they're truck and airplane objects. Let me assume the intent was to state the locations of these objects, so:

"Truck t1 is in location l1_7"
"Truck t2 is in location l2_3"
"Package p1 is in location l2_1"
"Airplane a1 is in location l1_1"
"Airplane a2 is in location l2_1"

With this understanding, I think my plan above is correct.

Ok, let's rewrite the plan with the action formats as given:

1. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
2. loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
3. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
4. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
5. drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_1 c1
6. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
7. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
8. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
9. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
10. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

Actually, it seems I made a mistake in how to unload from an airplane. Let me correct the format:

1. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
2. loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
3. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
4. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
5. drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_1 c1
6. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
7. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
8. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
9. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
10. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

Hmm, I notice an issue with the action formats I provided. Let me double check the actions in the problem statement:

"loadtruck p t l": Load package p in truck t. Both p and t are in location l.
"loadairplane p ap l": Load package p in airplane ap. Both p and ap are in location l.
"unloadtruck p t l": Unload package p from truck t in location l.
"unloadairplane p ap l": Unload package p from airplane ap in location l.
"drivetruck t l_from l_to c": Drive truck t from location l_from to location l_to in city c.
"flyairplane ap l_from l_to": Fly airplane ap from location l_from to location l_to.

I got confused because there are two `"loadairplane"` and no `"unloadairplane"` in the list. But based on the preconditions and effects, I can infer that the second "loadairplane" should be "unloadairplane". So, I'll continue with the corrected actions.

1. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
2. loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
3. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
4. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
5. drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_1 c1
6. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
7. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
8. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
9. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
10. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

After these steps, p1 is in l1_1, which satisfies the goal.

Actually, I just realized that steps 6 and 7 are unnecessary. They just put p1 in t1 and then immediately take it out again, which doesn't change the state of the world. But the constraint says that if p1 is in a2 at some point, it must have been in t1 at an earlier state. So, we still need these steps to satisfy the constraint.

Actually, upon further reflection, I need to check if there's a simpler plan that satisfies the goals and constraints. Let's refine:

1. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
2. Load p1 into a1 at l2_1.
3. Fly a1 from l2_1 to l1_1.
4. Unload p1 from a1 at l1_1.

Wait, this plan doesn't satisfy the constraint that p1 must be in a2 at some point. Let's refine again:

1. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
2. Load p1 into a1 at l2_1.
3. Fly a1 from l2_1 to l1_1.
4. Unload p1 from a1 at l1_1.
5. Drive t1 from l1_7 to l1_1 in c1.
6. Load p1 into t1 at l1_1.
7. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1.
8. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
9. Load p1 into a2 at l1_1.
10. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1.

This plan satisfies all constraints and the goal, but I'm not sure if it's the most optimal (shortest). Let's think if there's any simpler way to achieve the goal while satisfying the constraints:

The constraints say:
1. p1 must be in a2 at some point.
2. Before p1 is in a2, it must have been in t1 at some point.
3. p1 must be in a1 at some point.

The minimum necessary steps to satisfy these constraints and the goal are:
1. Load p1 into a1 and fly it from l2_1 to l1_1.
2. Load p1 into t1 and then unload it.
3. Load p1 into a2 and then unload it.

And we need to move a1 to l2_1, move t1 to where p1 is, and move a2 to where p1 is.

Given the initial state, the optimal plan is likely the one I've already listed. Let's go with that.

Actually I realize that a more optimal plan would be:

1. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
2. Load p1 into a1 at l2_1.
3. Fly a1 from l2_1 to l1_1.
4. Unload p1 from a1 at l1_1.
5. Drive t1 from l1_7 to l1_1 in c1.
6. Load p1 into t1 at l1_1.
7. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1.
8. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
9. Load p1 into a2 at l1_1.
10. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1.

Looking back at this plan, I'm not seeing a way to shorten it while still satisfying the constraints. So, I'll write this as my final answer.

1. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
2. loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
3. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
4. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
5. drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_1 c1
6. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
7. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
8. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
9. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
10. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

This plan ensures p1 is in a1 at some point (steps 2-3), it ensures p1 is in t1 before being in a2 (steps 6-7 happen before steps 9-10), it ensures p1 is in a2 at some point (steps 9-10), and finally, after all these constraints are satisfied, p1 is in l1_1, which meets the goal.

Actually, I just realized that "Package p1 is in a1" in the constraint means the airplane, not the location. So, all three constraints are about packages being in vehicles, not locations. The way the statements are phrased made it look like a1, a2 were locations. But given the context of the constraints, they clearly refer to airplanes. So, I'm still confident in my plan.

Actually, one more thing: I want to double check where objects are. Here's what I currently think:
"Truck t1 is in location l1_7"
"Truck t2 is in location l2_3"
"Package p1 is in location l2_1"
"Airplane a1 is in location l1_1"
"Airplane a2 is in location l2_1"

So, initially, p1 and a2 are both in l2_1, a1 is in l1_1, and t1 is in l1_7. This is important because it determines the first few steps of my plan.

Given the above, my plan should still be optimal, but let me double check to make sure I'm scheduling things in the cheapest way.

Initially, p1 and a2 are both in l2_1, a1 is in l1_1, and t1 is in l1_7. The goal is to have p1 in l1_1, and we have the constraints that p1 needs to be in a1, a2, and t1 (with the order constraint that it should be in t1 before a2).

So, the plan should be:
1. a1 flies from l1_1 to l2_1.
2. p1 is loaded into a1 at l2_1.
3. a1 flies from l2_1 to l1_1.
4. p1 is unloaded from a1 at l1_1.
5. t1 drives from l1_7 to l1_1 in c1.
6. p1 is loaded into t1 at l1_1.
7. p1 is unloaded from t1 at l1_1.
8. a2 flies from l2_1 to l1_1.
9. p1 is loaded into a2 at l1_1.
10. p1 is unloaded from a2 at l1_1.

At the end of step 10, p1 is at l1_1, which satisfies the goal. I don't see a way to shorten this plan, so I'll go with it.

Alright, so the formal plan with the exact syntax is:
1. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
2. loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
3. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
4. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
5. drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_1 c1
6. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
7. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
8. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
9. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
10. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
