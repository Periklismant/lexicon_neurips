Okay, let's see. I need to find a plan to get package p1 from its initial location l2_1 to l1_1, while satisfying all the constraints. The constraints are a bit tricky here. Let me break them down.

First, the goal is to have p1 in l1_1. The initial state says p1 is in l2_1, which is in city c2. Also, l2_1 is an airport because it's listed as an airport. So, p1 starts at an airport in c2. The target is an airport in c1 (l1_1 is the airport there). So probably, we need to fly p1 from c2 to c1. But how?

The constraints are:

1. At some state, p1 must be in a2. 
2. If p1 is in a2 at any state, there must be an earlier state where p1 is in t1.
3. At some state, p1 must be in a1.

So, the plan must involve moving p1 into a2, but before that, it was in t1. Also, p1 must be in a1 at some point.

Let's look at the objects. There are two airplanes: a1 and a2. a1 is initially in l1_1, and a2 is in l2_1. Wait, wait: the original state says "Package a1 is in location l1_1" and "Package a2 is in location l2_1". Wait, no. Wait, the objects include "airplane a1" and "airplane a2". But in the original state, the packages are listed as p1, t1, t2, a1, a2. Wait, no. Wait, the original state lists "Package t1 is in location l1_7", "Package t2 is in location l2_3", "Package p1 is in location l2_1", "Package a1 is in location l1_1", "Package a2 is in location l2_1". Wait, that's confusing. Are a1 and a2 airplanes or packages? Wait, the objects include "airplane a1", "airplane a2", and "package p1", "truck t1", "truck t2". So the original state has a mistake here. Wait, the user probably made a typo. Because in the original state, "Package a1 is in location l1_1" and "Package a2 is in l2_1". But a1 and a2 are airplanes, not packages. That must be an error. So maybe the correct initial state is that airplane a1 is in l1_1 and airplane a2 is in l2_1. Because otherwise, you can't load packages into them. So I think there's a typo in the original state. The user probably meant:

"Airplane a1 is in location l1_1"
"Airplane a2 is in location l2_1"

But as written, the original state lists a1 and a2 as packages. That's a problem. But since the problem mentions that airplanes can carry packages, I have to assume that a1 and a2 are airplanes, not packages. So this must be an error in the problem statement. So maybe I should proceed under the assumption that the initial positions for airplanes a1 and a2 are l1_1 and l2_1 respectively, even though the problem states them as packages. Otherwise, it's impossible to use the airplanes. So I'll proceed with that correction.

So, initial positions:

- a1 (airplane) is at l1_1 (airport in c1)
- a2 (airplane) is at l2_1 (airport in c2)
- p1 is at l2_1 (airport in c2)
- t1 (truck) is in l1_7 (city c1)
- t2 (truck) is in l2_3 (city c2)

Wait, but the original state says "Package t1 is in location l1_7", "Package t2 is in l2_3". Again, t1 and t2 are trucks, not packages. So there's a mistake here. So the correct initial state for the trucks should be that t1 is in l1_7 and t2 is in l2_3, not as packages. The problem statement has an error here, but we have to adjust to make sense of it.

So, the actual initial state is:

Trucks:

- t1 is in l1_7 (city c1)
- t2 is in l2_3 (city c2)

Airplanes:

- a1 is in l1_1 (airport in c1)
- a2 is in l2_1 (airport in c2)

Packages:

- p1 is in l2_1 (c2's airport)
- a1 (package?) and a2 (package?) are in l1_1 and l2_1, but that's conflicting. But since a1 and a2 are airplanes, they can't be packages. So perhaps the original state entries for a1 and a2 are incorrect, and should instead indicate the airplanes' locations. So the correct initial positions are:

Airplanes:

- a1 is at l1_1
- a2 is at l2_1

Trucks:

- t1 is at l1_7 (city c1)
- t2 is at l2_3 (city c2)

Packages:

- p1 is at l2_1 (airport in c2)
- t1 (package?) No, t1 is a truck. So probably, the original state entries for "Package t1 is in l1_7" and "Package t2 is in l2_3" are incorrect. So perhaps those are trucks. So the problem statement has several typos. Given that, perhaps the user intended that:

Original state:

- Truck t1 is in location l1_7 (city c1)
- Truck t2 is in location l2_3 (city c2)
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (city c1's airport)
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1 (city c2's airport)
- Package p1 is in l2_1 (airport in c2)
- Other packages (maybe t1 and t2 are packages, but that's conflicting with the trucks). This is very confusing. 

But given that the available actions involve loading packages into trucks and airplanes, the problem must have:

- Trucks t1, t2
- Airplanes a1, a2
- Packages p1, maybe others (but the original state lists t1, t2, a1, a2 as packages, which is conflicting). This seems like a mistake. Maybe the user meant to list the trucks and airplanes in their locations, not as packages. 

To resolve this, I think the correct initial positions are:

- Truck t1 is in l1_7 (city c1)
- Truck t2 is in l2_3 (city c2)
- Airplane a1 is in l1_1 (city c1's airport)
- Airplane a2 is in l2_1 (city c2's airport)
- Package p1 is in l2_1 (airport in c2)
- Other packages (like t1, t2, a1, a2) are probably typos and should be ignored, or maybe they are other packages. But since the problem's goal is about p1, maybe those are irrelevant. 

But the constraints require that p1 is in a2 and a1 at some point, and that when p1 is in a2, it was previously in t1. 

Wait, but how can p1 be in t1 (the truck in c1) when p1 starts in l2_1 (c2's airport). So to get p1 into t1 (which is in c1), we need to transport p1 from c2 to c1. But how? Since trucks can't move between cities. Only airplanes can fly between airports. So the plan would involve:

1. Load p1 into airplane a2 (since a2 is in l2_1, same as p1). Then fly a2 to l1_1. Then unload p1 into l1_1. But wait, but the constraints say that p1 must be in a1 and a2. Also, before p1 is in a2, it must have been in t1. But t1 is in c1. So this approach doesn't involve t1. So perhaps another approach is needed.

Alternatively, maybe:

First, move p1 from l2_1 (c2's airport) into a2 (airplane). Then fly a2 to c1's airport (l1_1). Then unload p1 into l1_1. But that's too straightforward. But according to the constraints, we have to have p1 in a2 (which is done here), and in a1. Also, the first constraint says that in at least one state, p1 is in a2. The third constraint requires that p1 is in a1 at some point. So the plan must involve p1 being loaded into both a2 and a1.

Additionally, the second constraint: if p1 is in a2 at any state, there must be a prior state where p1 is in t1. But t1 is a truck in c1. So p1 needs to be in t1 (truck in c1) before it's in a2 (which is in c2's airport). Wait, that's a problem. Because t1 is in c1, and p1 starts in c2. So how can p1 get into t1 (c1's truck) before being loaded into a2 (which is in c2)? That seems impossible unless there's some movement between cities. 

Wait, maybe the plan involves moving p1 from c2 to c1 via airplane a2, then into truck t1, then back into a2 (but a2 is in c2's airport, so how?). This is getting complicated. Let me think step by step.

The goal is to get p1 to l1_1 (c1's airport). The initial position is l2_1 (c2's airport). So p1 starts at an airport. So maybe using an airplane to fly it directly from l2_1 to l1_1. But then, the constraints require that:

- At some point, p1 is in a2. So if we load p1 into a2 (which is already in l2_1), then fly a2 to l1_1, and unload p1 there. That would satisfy the first constraint (p1 is in a2). Then, the second constraint: if p1 is in a2, then earlier it was in t1. But in this case, p1 was loaded into a2 directly from l2_1. So that doesn't involve t1. So this plan would violate the second constraint. Therefore, that approach won't work.

Alternative approach: to get p1 into a2, but first into t1. But t1 is in c1. So how does p1 get into t1 (c1's truck) before being loaded into a2 (c2's airplane)? That would require moving p1 from c2 to c1 first, then into t1, then somehow back to c2 to load into a2. But that's a longer path, but perhaps necessary to satisfy the constraints.

Let me outline possible steps:

1. Load p1 into a2 in l2_1 (since both are there). Then fly a2 to l1_1 (c1's airport). Unload p1 into l1_1. But then, the constraints are:

- p1 is in a2 (during transport), which satisfies the first constraint.
- However, the second constraint requires that before p1 is in a2, it was in t1. But in this plan, p1 was never in t1. So this plan is invalid.

Therefore, we need to find a way to get p1 into t1 (truck in c1) before it's loaded into a2 (airplane in c2). But that seems impossible unless p1 is first moved to c1, loaded into t1, then somehow transported back to c2, loaded into a2, then moved back to c1. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the plan involves moving p1 via multiple steps. Let's see:

Step 1: Load p1 into a2 (in l2_1), fly a2 to l1_1 (c1's airport). Now p1 is in l1_1. Then load p1 into t1 (truck in c1). But t1 is in l1_7. So we need to drive t1 from l1_7 to l1_1. Then load p1 into t1. Then, perhaps unload p1 back into l1_1 again, then load into a1 (airplane in l1_1), then fly a1 somewhere? But the goal is to have p1 in l1_1, so maybe this is not necessary. But let's check the constraints.

The constraints are:

- p1 must be in a2 at some state. That would happen when it's loaded into a2 and before being unloaded in l1_1.

- If p1 is in a2, then there must be an earlier state where p1 is in t1. But in this case, the first time p1 is in a2 is before it's ever in t1. So that violates the second constraint.

So this approach won't work. Therefore, we need to arrange that p1 is loaded into t1 before being loaded into a2.

But since p1 starts in c2, how to get it into t1 (c1's truck)?

One possible way:

First, fly p1 from c2 to c1 via airplane a2.

Wait, but a2 is in l2_1. So load p1 into a2 at l2_1, fly a2 to l1_1. Unload p1 into l1_1. Now, p1 is in l1_1 (which is the goal). But then, to satisfy the constraints, we need to have p1 in a2 (done), in a1, and when in a2, must have been in t1 before.

But in this case, after unloading into l1_1, maybe load p1 into a1 (which is already at l1_1). So:

Action: loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1. Then fly a1 somewhere else? But the goal is to have p1 in l1_1. So maybe after loading into a1, we unload it again in l1_1. That way, p1 is in a1 at some point. But this would satisfy the third constraint.

But the problem is the second constraint: when p1 is in a2 (during the initial flight), there must be a previous state where p1 was in t1. But in this plan, p1 is in a2 before being in t1. So that's a problem.

So perhaps we need to first get p1 into t1 (truck in c1), then into a2 (airplane in c2), but how?

Wait, p1 is in c2's airport (l2_1). To get it into c1's truck t1, which is in l1_7 (c1). So maybe:

1. Load p1 into a2 (l2_1), fly a2 to l1_1 (c1's airport).

2. Unload p1 into l1_1.

3. Drive truck t1 from l1_7 to l1_1.

4. Load p1 into t1.

5. Now, to get p1 into a2 again, which is now in l1_1 (if a2 is still there). Wait, after flying to l1_1, a2 is in l1_1. So perhaps:

6. Load p1 into a2 again (now in l1_1), then fly a2 back to l2_1. Then unload p1 into l2_1. But then p1 is back in c2. That seems redundant, but maybe necessary to satisfy the constraint that before being in a2 (second time), p1 was in t1.

But the problem is that the initial loading of p1 into a2 (first step) would require that before that, p1 was in t1, which is not the case. So this approach still doesn't solve the second constraint.

Alternative approach: maybe use two different airplanes and trucks.

But let's think differently. Since the constraints require that when p1 is in a2, there's an earlier state where it's in t1. So the first time p1 is loaded into a2, it must have been in t1 before. But t1 is in c1, and p1 is in c2. So how?

This seems impossible unless we first move p1 to c1, load into t1, then move it back to c2 and into a2. But how to move it back? Because trucks can't go between cities. Only airplanes can. So:

Possible steps:

1. Move p1 from l2_1 (c2) to l1_1 (c1) via a2:

   - loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
   - flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
   - unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
   Now p1 is in l1_1 (goal achieved, but we need to process the constraints)
   
2. Then, load p1 into truck t1 (which is in l1_7, so need to drive it to l1_1):

   - drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_1 c1
   - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
   Now p1 is in t1. Then, to get it into a2, which is now at l1_1 (since we flew a2 there), but a2 is an airplane. So we can load p1 from t1 into a2:

   - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (but this would put p1 back in l1_1)
   - loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
   Then fly a2 back to l2_1:
   - flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
   - unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
   Then load p1 into a2 again (but why?), but this is getting too complicated.

But according to the constraints, the first time p1 is in a2 must have been preceded by being in t1. So perhaps:

- First, move p1 from l2_1 to l1_1 via a2, then into t1, then back into a2 (which is now in l1_1). But after flying a2 to l1_1, it's there. So load p1 into a2 again, then fly back to l2_1. But why?

Alternatively, perhaps the plan must involve moving p1 into t1, then into a2, then into a1.

Wait, the third constraint is that p1 must be in a1 at some state. So after getting p1 into l1_1, load it into a1 (which is already there), then unload again. That way, the third constraint is satisfied.

So here's a possible plan:

1. Load p1 into a2 at l2_1.
   - loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
2. Fly a2 to l1_1.
   - flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
3. Unload p1 from a2 into l1_1.
   - unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
   Now p1 is at l1_1 (goal achieved), but need to check constraints.

But the constraints are:

- Must have p1 in a2 (done).
- If p1 is in a2, must have been in t1 before. But in this case, when p1 was loaded into a2 (step 1), it wasn't in t1 before. So this plan violates the second constraint.

Therefore, we need to find a way to get p1 into t1 before it's loaded into a2.

But how? Because p1 starts in c2, and t1 is in c1.

So the only way is to first move p1 to c1, put it into t1, then move it back to c2, load into a2, then fly back to c1.

But how to move p1 back to c2? Using another airplane.

Wait, a1 is in l1_1 (c1's airport). So:

Plan steps:

1. Load p1 into a2 (l2_1), fly to l1_1, unload. Now p1 is in l1_1.

2. Drive truck t1 from l1_7 to l1_1.

3. Load p1 into t1.

4. Now, to get p1 into a2 again, but a2 is in l1_1. So load p1 into a2 again.

5. Fly a2 back to l2_1.

6. Unload p1 into l2_1.

7. Now, load p1 into a2 again (l2_1), fly to l1_1 again.

But this is very redundant and probably not optimal. Also, the goal is already achieved in step 1. But the constraints need to be met. Let's see:

- The first time p1 is in a2 is step 1. But before that, p1 wasn't in t1. So this violates the second constraint.

Alternative approach:

Use a1 to transport p1 from c2 to c1? But a1 is initially in l1_1. So to get a1 to c2, need to fly it to l2_1. But p1 is in l2_1. So:

1. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.

   - flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

2. Load p1 into a1 at l2_1.

   - loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

3. Fly a1 back to l1_1.

   - flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1

4. Unload p1 into l1_1.

   Now p1 is at goal. Also, in step 2, p1 was in a1 (third constraint met).

But then, we still need to satisfy the first and second constraints: p1 must be in a2, and when in a2, must have been in t1 before.

So after unloading p1 into l1_1, we need to get it into a2. But a2 is in l2_1. So we need to transport p1 back to c2. But the goal is to have it in l1_1. So this would undo the goal. Not good.

Alternatively, maybe during the process, we can have p1 in a2 after being in t1.

But this is getting complicated. Let's think again.

The constraints are:

1. p1 must be in a2 at least once.

2. Whenever p1 is in a2, there must be a prior state where it was in t1.

3. p1 must be in a1 at least once.

The goal is to have p1 in l1_1.

So the plan must include steps where p1 is loaded into a2 (satisfies constraint 1), after being in t1 (constraint 2), and also loaded into a1 (constraint 3).

So possible steps:

- Use a2 to move p1 from c2 to c1, but first load it into t1. Wait, but how?

Alternative plan:

1. Load p1 into a2 at l2_1 (c2's airport).

2. Fly a2 to l1_1 (c1's airport).

3. Unload p1 into l1_1. Now p1 is at goal.

4. Now, drive truck t1 from l1_7 to l1_1.

5. Load p1 into t1.

6. Unload p1 back into l1_1.

7. Load p1 into a1 (which is at l1_1).

8. Unload p1 into l1_1.

Now, let's check constraints:

- p1 is in a2 (step 1-2). So constraint 1 met.

- When p1 was in a2 (steps 1-2), was there a prior state where p1 was in t1? No. Because step 5 (loading into t1) happens after. So this violates constraint 2.

Therefore, this plan is invalid.

Alternative approach: first get p1 into t1, then into a2.

But p1 is in c2. So:

1. Move p1 from l2_1 (c2) to some location in c2 that's not an airport, using a truck. But trucks can't move between cities. So use truck t2, which is in l2_3.

But p1 is in l2_1 (airport). So:

Action: drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2.

Then load p1 into t2.

But trucks can only drive within their city. So t2 is in c2, can drive to l2_1.

So steps:

1. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1.

2. Load p1 into t2.

3. Then drive t2 to l2_1 (already there?), no. Wait, t2 starts at l2_3. After driving to l2_1, then load p1 into t2. Then drive somewhere else? Not sure.

But how does this help in getting p1 into a2 after being in t1 (which is in c1). This seems unrelated.

Alternatively, maybe use t2 to move p1 to l2_1, then load into a2. But that's redundant since p1 is already in l2_1. But maybe the idea is to get p1 into a2 after being in a truck (t2). But the second constraint requires that when p1 is in a2, it was previously in t1 (which is in c1). So using t2 (c2's truck) doesn't help.

This is getting too confusing. Let me try to outline a plan that meets all constraints.

Constraints:

- Must have p1 in a2 at some point.

- Whenever p1 is in a2, there's a prior state where p1 was in t1.

- Must have p1 in a1 at some point.

Goal: p1 in l1_1.

Possible steps:

1. Load p1 into a2 (in l2_1). Then fly to l1_1. Unload. Now p1 is at goal. But violates constraint 2 because no prior t1.

Alternative plan:

First, get p1 into t1 (c1's truck), then into a2. But p1 starts in c2. So to get to c1's truck, need to fly.

So:

1. Load p1 into a2 (l2_1), fly to l1_1.

2. Unload into l1_1.

3. Drive t1 from l1_7 to l1_1.

4. Load p1 into t1.

5. Now, to satisfy constraint 2: when p1 is in a2, it was in t1 before. So we need to load p1 into a2 after step 4. But a2 is currently in l1_1. So:

5. Load p1 into a2 (now in l1_1).

6. Fly a2 back to l2_1.

7. Unload p1 into l2_1.

But now p1 is back in c2. So need to fly it back again.

8. Load p1 into a2 again (l2_1), fly to l1_1.

9. Unload into l1_1.

Now, the first time p1 is in a2 (step 1), there was no prior t1. So this violates constraint 2. The second time p1 is in a2 (step 5), yes, there was a prior state where it was in t1 (step 4). But the first time p1 was in a2 (steps 1-2) would still violate the constraint.

So this approach won't work.

Alternative idea: have two separate times when p1 is in a2. The first time doesn't require t1, but the second time does. But the constraints say "if the expression holds in some state", so the first time would still require that it was in t1 before, which it wasn't.

Therefore, the only way to satisfy constraint 2 is that every time p1 is in a2, there's a prior state where it was in t1. So the first time p1 is loaded into a2 must be after it was in t1.

But how to do that? Since p1 starts in c2, and t1 is in c1.

So steps:

1. Fly a1 (which is in l1_1) to l2_1.

   - flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

2. Load p1 into a1 (in l2_1).

   - loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

3. Fly a1 back to l1_1.

   - flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1

4. Unload p1 into l1_1.

   Now p1 is in l1_1 (goal), and in a1 (step 2-3) satisfies constraint 3.

5. Now, drive t1 to l1_1.

   - drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_1 c1

6. Load p1 into t1.

   - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

7. Now, to get p1 into a2 (which is in l2_1), need to transport p1 back to c2. But trucks can't go there. So:

7. Unload p1 from t1 into l1_1.

   - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

8. Load p1 into a2 (which is in l2_1). But a2 is in c2's airport. How to get p1 there? We need to fly a2 to l1_1 first.

   - flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

9. Load p1 into a2 (now in l1_1).

   - loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

10. Fly a2 back to l2_1.

    - flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1

11. Unload p1 into l2_1.

But now, p1 is back in c2, which is not the goal. So need to fly it back again.

12. Load p1 into a2 again, fly to l1_1, unload.

But this is getting very long. However, the key point is that step 9 (loading into a2) happens after step 6 (loading into t1). So when p1 is in a2 (step 9), there was a prior state (step 6) where it was in t1. So this satisfies constraint 2.

Also, constraint 1 is satisfied because p1 is in a2 (step 9).

Constraint 3 is satisfied because p1 was in a1 (step 2).

The goal is achieved in step 4, but in step 11, p1 is back in c2, which is not desired. So we need to ensure that after all the required steps, p1 ends up in l1_1.

So after step 4, p1 is in l1_1. Then steps 5-11 move it to t1, then to a2, then back to c2, which is not good. So perhaps after step 6 (p1 is in t1), instead of unloading, we load it into a2 which is in l1_1.

Wait, after step 4, p1 is in l1_1. Then:

5. Drive t1 to l1_1.

6. Load p1 into t1.

7. Now, to get p1 into a2, which is still in l2_1. So we need to move a2 to l1_1.

8. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.

9. Unload p1 from t1 into l1_1 (no, p1 is in t1).

Wait, after step 6, p1 is in t1. To load into a2 (which is in l1_1 after step 8):

9. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (but t1 is in l1_1, so this unloads p1 into l1_1. But then p1 is in l1_1 again.

Then load into a2:

10. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1.

11. Fly a2 to l1_1 (no, already there). So fly a2 to some other location? No need. Then unload p1 into l1_1 again.

But in this case, p1 is loaded into a2 (step 10), which satisfies constraint 1. And prior to that, it was in t1 (step 6), so constraint 2 is satisfied. Also, constraint 3 is met because p1 was in a1 (step 2).

But after step 10, if we unload p1 into l1_1, then the goal is still met. So the plan could be:

1. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

2. loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

3. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1

4. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

5. drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_1 c1

6. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

7. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

8. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

9. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

10. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l1_1 (no, same location). So instead, maybe just unload.

But after step 9, p1 is in a2. Then we can unload it back into l1_1.

11. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

Now, the final state is p1 in l1_1. The steps are:

1. Fly a1 to l2_1.

2. Load p1 into a1.

3. Fly a1 back to l1_1.

4. Unload p1 into l1_1 (goal met here).

5. Drive t1 to l1_1.

6. Load p1 into t1.

7. Fly a2 to l1_1.

8. Unload p1 from t1 into l1_1.

9. Load p1 into a2.

10. Unload p1 from a2 into l1_1.

But this seems redundant. Let's check if all constraints are met:

- p1 is in a2 (step 9). Constraint 1 met.

- Before step 9, p1 was in t1 (step 6). Constraint 2 met.

- p1 is in a1 (step 2). Constraint 3 met.

The goal is achieved in step 4, and remains achieved through step 10.

But steps 5-10 are unnecessary for the goal but required for the constraints. However, the problem states that the plan must be valid (achieve the goal and satisfy constraints) and optimal (shortest possible). So the question is, can we find a shorter plan?

Alternative plan:

1. Load p1 into a2 (l2_1).

2. Fly a2 to l1_1.

3. Unload p1 into l1_1. Now goal achieved.

4. Drive t1 to l1_1.

5. Load p1 into t1.

6. Unload p1 into l1_1.

7. Load p1 into a1.

8. Unload p1 into l1_1.

But in this plan, p1 is in a2 (step 1-2), but before that, it wasn't in t1. So violates constraint 2.

Another idea: Maybe use a1 to transport p1 to c1, then into t1, then into a2 which is then flown to c1.

Wait, a2 is initially in l2_1. So:

1. Fly a1 to l2_1.

2. Load p1 into a1.

3. Fly a1 back to l1_1.

4. Unload p1 into l1_1.

5. Drive t1 to l1_1.

6. Load p1 into t1.

7. Fly a2 to l1_1.

8. Unload p1 from t1 into l1_1.

9. Load p1 into a2.

10. Unload p1 into l1_1.

This plan has:

- p1 in a1 (step 2-3), satisfies constraint 3.

- p1 in a2 (step 9), satisfies constraint 1.

- Before being in a2 (step 9), p1 was in t1 (step 6), satisfies constraint 2.

The goal is achieved in step 4 and remains.

So steps:

1. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

2. loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

3. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1

4. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

5. drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_1 c1

6. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

7. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

8. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

9. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

10. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

This plan has 10 actions. But maybe some steps can be optimized.

After step 4, p1 is in l1_1. Then steps 5-10 are done to meet the constraints. But can we do fewer steps?

For example, after step 6, p1 is in t1. Then fly a2 to l1_1 (step 7), then unload p1 from t1 into l1_1 (step 8), then load into a2 (step 9), then unload again. But steps 8 and 10 are unnecessary if we can load directly from t1 into a2.

Wait, to load into a2, both p1 and a2 must be in the same location. So after step 7, a2 is in l1_1. If p1 is in t1 (step 6), which is in l1_1, then we can unload p1 from t1 into l1_1, then load into a2. But perhaps there's a way to load p1 directly from t1 into a2, but according to the actions, you can only loadtruck if both p and t are in the same location. So to load into a2, p1 must be in the same location as a2. If a2 is in l1_1 (after flying), and t1 is in l1_1, then p1 is in t1 (which is in l1_1). So to load into a2, you need to first unload p1 from t1 into l1_1 (so it's in the location), then load into a2. Because the loadairplane action requires that both p and ap are in the same location.

So you can't load p1 directly from the truck into the airplane. You have to unload it into the location first.

Therefore, steps 6, 8, 9 are necessary:

6. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (puts p1 in t1)

7. fly a2 to l1_1.

8. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (p1 now in l1_1)

9. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

So these steps are required.

Thus, the plan is 10 actions. Is there a shorter way?

Alternatively, after step 6 (p1 in t1), can we unload into l1_1 and then load into a2 without flying a2?

No, because a2 is in l2_1 initially. So to get a2 to l1_1, we need to fly it there (step 7). So that's necessary.

Another optimization: maybe combine steps. For example, after flying a2 to l1_1 (step 7), then unload p1 from t1 (step 8), load into a2 (step 9), and then unload again (step 10). But since the goal is to have p1 in l1_1, the final unload (step 10) is needed to put it back.

But wait, after step 9, p1 is in a2. Then step 10 unloads it into l1_1. But since the goal is already achieved in step 4, but the plan must end with p1 in l1_1, this is acceptable.

But steps 4 and 10 both have p1 in l1_1, so steps after step 4 are redundant in terms of the goal but necessary for the constraints.

Alternatively, can we avoid unloading p1 after step 9? If we leave p1 in a2, but the goal requires it to be in l1_1. So we have to unload it.

So the plan must include steps 1-10.

Is this the shortest possible?

Another approach:

After step 4 (p1 in l1_1), we need to get p1 into t1 and then into a2, and also into a1.

But p1 was in a1 during steps 2-3.

So perhaps steps:

1. fly a1 to l2_1.

2. load p1 into a1.

3. fly back to l1_1.

4. unload p1.

5. drive t1 to l1_1.

6. load p1 into t1.

7. drive t1 to some location in c1, say l1_2.

8. unload p1 into l1_2.

9. load p1 into t1 again.

10. drive back to l1_1.

11. unload p1.

But this doesn't help with the constraints.

Alternatively, after step 6 (p1 in t1), fly a2 to l1_1, then unload p1 into l1_1, then load into a2. So steps:

1. fly a1 to l2_1.

2. load p1 into a1.

3. fly back to l1_1.

4. unload.

5. drive t1 to l1_1.

6. load p1 into t1.

7. fly a2 to l1_1.

8. unload p1 from t1.

9. load p1 into a2.

10. unload p1 into l1_1.

This is 10 steps. But perhaps steps 7 and 8 can be reordered? No, because a2 must be in l1_1 to load p1 into it.

Thus, this seems to be the minimal plan.

So the final plan is:

```
flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_1 c1
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
```

This plan has 10 actions. Let's check if all constraints are met:

- p1 is in a2 (step 9), satisfying constraint 1.

- Before that, in step 6, p1 is in t1, satisfying constraint 2.

- p1 is in a1 (step 2), satisfying constraint 3.

The goal is achieved in step 4 and maintained through step 10.

Is there a shorter plan? For example, can we avoid flying a2 to l1_1?

If we can load p1 into a2 while it's in l2_1, but after p1 has been in t1. But p1 is in c1's t1. To get p1 back to l2_1 would require flying, which would require loading into a1 again and flying back. That would add more steps.

Alternatively, after p1 is in t1 (step 6), can we drive t1 to some location in c1, then load into a1 again, fly to l2_1, unload, then load into a2. But that would be longer.

Thus, the 10-step plan seems to be the optimal.
