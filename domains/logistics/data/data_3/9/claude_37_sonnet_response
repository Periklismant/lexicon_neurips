Okay, let me analyze this logistics planning problem. I need to create a plan to transport packages p1 and p2 to locations l1_4 and l2_4 respectively, while satisfying certain constraints.

First, let's identify the initial state again (there seems to be an error in the problem statement where trucks and airplanes are referred to as packages):

Initial state:
- Locations l1_1, l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5 are in city c1
- Locations l2_1, l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5 are in city c2
- l1_1 and l2_1 are airports
- Truck t1 is in location l1_2
- Truck t2 is in location l2_1
- Package p1 is in location l1_2
- Package p2 is in location l2_2
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

Goal:
- Package p1 must be in location l1_4
- Package p2 must be in location l2_4

Constraints:
1. At some point, p2 must be in location l2_1
2. At some point, either p1 must be in airplane a2 OR p2 must be in airplane a1
3. At some point, p2 must be in location l2_4 (this is part of the goal anyway)
4. If p2 is in location l2_4, then p1 must have been in location l2_3 at some earlier point

Let me think through this:

The last constraint is particularly important: before p2 reaches its goal location of l2_4, p1 must visit location l2_3 (which is in city c2, while p1 starts in city c1).

Given this constraint, I'll need to:
1. Transport p1 from city c1 to city c2, specifically to location l2_3
2. Only after that, I can move p2 to its final destination l2_4
3. Then I need to transport p1 back to city c1, specifically to location l1_4

Also, I need to ensure that:
- p2 visits l2_1 at some point (likely when it's being transported)
- Either p1 is in a2 or p2 is in a1 at some point (this will likely happen during transport between cities)

Let me create a plan:

1. First, I'll get p1 from l1_2 to l2_3:
   - Load p1 onto truck t1 at l1_2
   - Drive t1 to airport l1_1
   - Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1
   - Load p1 onto airplane a1 at l1_1
   - Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1
   - Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1
   - Load p1 onto truck t2 at l2_1
   - Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_3
   - Unload p1 from t2 at l2_3
   
2. Now p1 is at l2_3, so I can move p2 to l2_4:
   - Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_2
   - Load p2 onto t2 at l2_2
   - Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1 (satisfying constraint 1: p2 visits l2_1)
   - Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4
   - Unload p2 from t2 at l2_4 (goal for p2 achieved)

3. Finally, I'll get p1 from l2_3 to l1_4:
   - Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_3
   - Load p1 onto t2 at l2_3
   - Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1
   - Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1
   - Load p1 onto airplane a2 at l2_1 (satisfying constraint 2: p1 is in a2)
   - Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1
   - Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1
   - Load p1 onto truck t1 at l1_1
   - Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_4
   - Unload p1 from t1 at l1_4 (goal for p1 achieved)

But wait, there's a potential issue with my plan. Let me check if I'm using t1 and t2 correctly according to their initial positions.

Initial positions:
- t1 is at l1_2
- t2 is at l2_1

So I need to adjust my plan to account for these initial positions. Let me revise:

1. Get p1 from l1_2 to l2_3:
   - Load p1 onto t1 at l1_2 (both are already there)
   - Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1 (the airport)
   - Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1
   - Load p1 onto a1 at l1_1
   - Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1
   - Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1
   - Load p1 onto t2 at l2_1 (t2 is already there)
   - Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_3
   - Unload p1 from t2 at l2_3

Now the rest of the plan needs to be adjusted:

2. Move p2 to l2_4:
   - Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_2
   - Load p2 onto t2 at l2_2
   - Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1 (satisfying constraint 1: p2 visits l2_1)
   - Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4
   - Unload p2 from t2 at l2_4

3. Move p1 to l1_4:
   - Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_3
   - Load p1 onto t2 at l2_3
   - Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1
   - Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1
   - Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1 (satisfying constraint 2: p1 is in a2)
   - Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1
   - Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1
   - Load p1 onto t1 at l1_1
   - Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_4
   - Unload p1 from t1 at l1_4

This plan seems to satisfy all the constraints and goals. Let me double-check:

1. At some point, p2 is in location l2_1 ✓ (when t2 drives through with p2)
2. At some point, p1 is in airplane a2 ✓ (when flying from l2_1 to l1_1)
3. At some point, p2 is in location l2_4 ✓ (final goal position for p2)
4. Before p2 reaches l2_4, p1 is in location l2_3 ✓ (p1 visits l2_3 before p2 reaches l2_4)
5. Final goals: p1 in l1_4 and p2 in l2_4 ✓

I think this plan is valid. Let me format it according to the required format:

Actually, there's a small optimization I can make. In my plan, I don't need to drive t2 back to l2_3 to pick up p1 - I could just drive t2 to l2_3 to get p1 before going to get p2. Let me revise the plan for efficiency:

1. Get p1 from l1_2 to l2_3:
   - Load p1 onto t1 at l1_2
   - Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1
   - Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1
   - Load p1 onto a1 at l1_1
   - Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1
   - Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1
   - Load p1 onto t2 at l2_1
   - Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_3
   - Unload p1 from t2 at l2_3

2. Move p1 to l1_4 (before handling p2):
   - Load p1 onto t2 at l2_3
   - Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1
   - Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1
   - Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1
   - Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1
   - Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1
   - Load p1 onto t1 at l1_1
   - Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_4
   - Unload p1 from t1 at l1_4

3. Move p2 to l2_4:
   - Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2
   - Load p2 onto t2 at l2_2
   - Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1
   - Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4
   - Unload p2 from t2 at l2_4

Wait, this wouldn't satisfy constraint 4, which requires p1 to be in l2_3 before p2 is in l2_4. Let me go back to the previous plan.

Actually, let me try to optimize it differently. Maybe I can get p2 into a1 to satisfy constraint 2 instead of putting p1 in a2:

1. Get p1 from l1_2 to l2_3:
   - Load p1 onto t1 at l1_2
   - Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1
   - Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1
   - Load p1 onto a1 at l1_1
   - Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1
   - Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1
   - Load p1 onto t2 at l2_1
   - Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_3
   - Unload p1 from t2 at l2_3

2. Move p2 to l2_4:
   - Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_2
   - Load p2 onto t2 at l2_2
   - Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1
   - Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1
   - Load p2 onto a1 at l2_1 (satisfying constraint 2: p2 is in a1)
   - Unload p2 from a1 at l2_1 (immediately unload it, we just needed p2 to be in a1 at some point)
   - Load p2 onto t2 at l2_1
   - Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4
   - Unload p2 from t2 at l2_4

3. Move p1 to l1_4:
   - Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_3
   - Load p1 onto t2 at l2_3
   - Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1
   - Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1
   - Fly a1 from l2_1 to l1_1 (moving a1 back to city c1)
   - Load p1 onto a1 at l2_1
   - Fly a1 from l2_1 to l1_1
   - Unload p1 from a1 at l1_1
   - Load p1 onto t1 at l1_1
   - Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_4
   - Unload p1 from t1 at l1_4

Hmm, I need to be more careful about the positions of vehicles. Let me redo this more carefully, tracking the locations of all objects:

Starting positions:
- p1 at l1_2
- p2 at l2_2
- t1 at l1_2
- t2 at l2_1
- a1 at l1_1
- a2 at l2_1

1. First, let's get p1 to l2_3:
   - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 (p1 is now in t1)
   - drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 (t1 and p1 are now at l1_1)
   - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (p1 is now at l1_1)
   - loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (p1 is now in a1)
   - flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (a1 and p1 are now at l2_1)
   - unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 (p1 is now at l2_1)
   - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (p1 is now in t2)
   - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2 (t2 and p1 are now at l2_3)
   - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (p1 is now at l2_3)

At this point:
- p1 is at l2_3
- p2 is at l2_2
- t1 is at l1_1
- t2 is at l2_3
- a1 is at l2_1
- a2 is at l2_1

2. Now, let's get p2 to l2_1 and then to l2_4:
   - drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2 (t2 is now at l2_2)
   - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (p2 is now in t2)
   - drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 (t2 and p2 are now at l2_1, satisfying constraint 1)
   - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (p2 is now at l2_1)
   - loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (p2 is now in a1, satisfying constraint 2)
   - unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (p2 is now at l2_1)
   - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (p2 is now in t2)
   - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2 (t2 and p2 are now at l2_4)
   - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (p2 is now at l2_4, goal for p2 achieved)

At this point:
- p1 is at l2_3
- p2 is at l2_4
- t1 is at l1_1
- t2 is at l2_4
- a1 is at l2_1
- a2 is at l2_1

3. Finally, let's get p1 to l1_4:
   - drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2 (t2 is now at l2_3)
   - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (p1 is now in t2)
   - drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2 (t2 and p1 are now at l2_1)
   - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (p1 is now at l2_1)
   - loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (p1 is now in a2)
   - flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (a2 and p1 are now at l1_1)
   - unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (p1 is now at l1_1)
   - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (p1 is now in t1)
   - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1 (t1 and p1 are now at l1_4)
   - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4 (p1 is now at l1_4, goal for p1 achieved)

This plan should satisfy all constraints:
1. p2 is in location l2_1 at one point ✓
2. p2 is in airplane a1 at one point ✓
3. p2 is in location l2_4 at the end ✓
4. p1 is in location l2_3 before p2 is in location l2_4 ✓
5. Final goals: p1 in l1_4 and p2 in l2_4 ✓

Let me format this as the final plan:

loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

Wait, actually I need to check something in the initial state again. Let me look at the exact wording:

Initial state:
- "Package t1 is in location l1_2"
- "Package t2 is in location l2_1"
- "Package p1 is in location l1_2"
- "Package p2 is in location l2_2"
- "Package a1 is in location l1_1"
- "Package a2 is in location l2_1"

This is a bit confusing as it's calling trucks and airplanes packages. Let me assume this is a typo, and the intended initial state is:

- Truck t1 is in location l1_2
- Truck t2 is in location l2_1
- Package p1 is in location l1_2
- Package p2 is in location l2_2
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

Which is what I used for my plan. Let me review the plan to make sure it's optimal.

Can I optimize this plan further? Let's check:

I see that I'm doing some extra actions with p2:
- Unloading it from t2 at l2_1
- Loading it onto a1 at l2_1
- Unloading it from a1 at l2_1
- Loading it back onto t2 at l2_1

This is done just to satisfy constraint 2 (p2 must be in a1 at some point). I think I can optimize by keeping p2 in t2 and directly satisfying constraint 1 (p2 must be in location l2_1):

loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 (constraint 1: p2 is in t2 which is at l2_1)
loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (need to unload p2 from t2 first)
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (constraint 2: p2 is in a1)
unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

I realize I can't make the optimization I was hoping for because I need to get p2 into a1 to satisfy constraint 2, and I also need to ensure p2 is in location l2_1 for constraint 1. 

Let me check if there's a better way to sequence these actions. The main constraint is that p1 must be in l2_3 before p2 is in l2_4. Let's try to optimize this:

I think the above plan is optimal given the constraints. Let's double check:

1. p1 starts at l1_2, needs to get to l2_3 before p2 gets to l2_4, and ultimately needs to end up at l1_4
2. p2 starts at l2_2, needs to visit l2_1, and ultimately needs to end up at l2_4
3. Either p1 needs to be in a2 or p2 needs to be in a1 at some point

My plan satisfies all these requirements efficiently:
- I first get p1 to l2_3
- Then I get p2 to l2_4, ensuring it visits l2_1 and goes into a1 on the way
- Finally, I get p1 to l1_4, using a2 for transportation

I don't see a way to further optimize this plan. Let me format it as the final answer:

```
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
```

Wait, let me double-check the action names I'm using to make sure they match the required format:

- "loadtruck p t l" - correct
- "loadairplane p ap l" - correct
- "unloadtruck p t l" - correct
- "loadairplane p ap l" - this is duplicated, should be "unloadairplane p ap l"
- "drivetruck t l_from l_to c" - correct
- "flyairplane ap l_from l_to" - correct

I need to correct "loadairplane" to "unloadairplane" in some places. Let me update the plan:

```
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
```

This plan satisfies all the constraints and should be optimal.
