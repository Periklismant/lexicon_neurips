Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. Hmm, the goal is to get p1 to l1_4 and p2 to l2_4. Also, there are some constraints we need to satisfy. Let me break it down step by step.

First, let's look at the initial state. Packages: p1 is at l1_2, which is in city c1. p2 is at l2_2 in city c2. The trucks and airplanes: t1 is at l1_2, t2 is at l2_1. Airplanes a1 is at l1_1 (which is an airport in c1), a2 is at l2_1 (airport in c2). 

Constraints:
1. At some state, p2 must be in l2_1. But initially, p2 is at l2_2. So we need to move p2 to l2_1 at some point.
2. At some state, either p1 is in a2 or p2 is in a1. So one of those two must happen.
3. The final state requires p2 to be in l2_4, which is in c2. So after moving p2 to l2_1, maybe we need to load it onto a plane or truck?
4. Also, if p2 is in l2_4 in some state, there must be an earlier state where p1 is in l2_3. Wait, l2_3 is in city c2. But p1 starts in c1. How can p1 get to c2? Since airplanes can fly between airports. So maybe we need to transport p1 to c2 using an airplane. But why would we do that? Because the constraint says that when p2 is in l2_4, there must have been a state where p1 was in l2_3. So p1 has to be moved to l2_3 in c2 at some point before p2 reaches l2_4.

Wait, but the goal for p1 is l1_4 in c1. So after moving p1 to l2_3, we need to bring it back to c1? That complicates things. Let me check the constraints again. The fourth constraint says that if p2 is in l2_4 (which is required in the goal), then there must be an earlier state where p1 is in l2_3. So even though the goal for p1 is in c1, we have to have p1 go to l2_3 (c2) first. That seems like a detour. So the plan must include moving p1 to l2_3, then back to c1 to reach l1_4.

Let me outline the steps for each package.

Starting with p1: It's in l1_2 (c1). We need to get it to l1_4. Since l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, etc., are in the same city (c1), a truck can move between them. But the truck t1 is already at l1_2. So maybe load p1 into t1, drive to l1_4, unload. But wait, the fourth constraint requires that before p2 is in l2_4, p1 was in l2_3. So p1 has to go to l2_3 first. How?

To move p1 from c1 to c2, we need to use an airplane. So steps would be: take p1 from l1_2 via truck to l1_1 (airport), load into airplane a1, fly to l2_1 (airport in c2), unload, then maybe use a truck in c2 to take it to l2_3. Then, perhaps bring it back via airplane to c1 again, then use a truck to l1_4. But that's a lot. But the goal for p1 is in c1, so maybe after bringing it back, drive to l1_4.

But this seems complicated, but necessary because of the constraint.

For p2: It's in l2_2 (c2). The first constraint says p2 must be in l2_1 at some point. So we need to move p2 from l2_2 to l2_1. Then maybe load it into a truck or airplane. But the goal is l2_4, which is in c2. So maybe use a truck. But moving from l2_1 to l2_4 would require driving through the city's locations. Wait, the cities have locations l2_1 (airport), l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5. So l2_1 is in c2, as are l2_2, etc. So to move from l2_2 to l2_1, perhaps use a truck. Wait, but t2 is in l2_1 initially. So how can we move p2 from l2_2 to l2_1? Maybe load p2 into t2, but t2 is at l2_1. Wait, p2 is at l2_2. So we need to get t2 to l2_2. But t2 is a truck in c2, which can drive between locations in c2. So drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2, load p2, then drive back to l2_1. Then, maybe drive to l2_4? But l2_1 is an airport, and l2_4 is a regular location. Wait, but trucks can drive between any locations in their city. So t2 can drive from l2_1 to l2_2 to l2_3 to l2_4, etc.

But let's outline the steps:

For p2:
1. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2 (current location of p2).
2. Load p2 into t2.
3. Drive t2 to l2_1 (to satisfy the first constraint: p2 must be in l2_1 at some state). Then unload p2 at l2_1. But why? Because the first constraint requires that p2 is in l2_1 in at least one state. So after step 3, we unload p2 at l2_1. Then, we need to get it to l2_4. So maybe then drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4, and unload. Wait, but can t2 drive from l2_1 to l2_4 directly? The drivetruck action allows moving between any locations in the same city. So if the city c2 has locations l2_1 to l2_5, then t2 can drive from l2_1 to l2_4 in one step. But perhaps the cities are connected in a way that requires sequential moves. But the problem statement doesn't specify that, so assuming that any location in the same city is reachable directly. So, for example, driving from l2_1 to l2_4 is allowed. So steps for p2 could be:

- Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2 (since p2 is there).
- Load p2 into t2 at l2_2.
- Drive t2 back to l2_1 (so p2 is now in l2_1, satisfying constraint 1).
- Then, drive t2 to l2_4, unload p2. That would satisfy the goal.

But wait, the fourth constraint says that if p2 is in l2_4 (which is the goal), then there must be an earlier state where p1 is in l2_3. So before p2 is delivered to l2_4, p1 must have been in l2_3. Therefore, the plan must include moving p1 to l2_3 before p2 is delivered to l2_4.

So how to get p1 to l2_3:

p1 starts in l1_2 (c1). To get to l2_3 (c2), we need to use an airplane. Steps:

1. Use truck t1 (in l1_2) to drive p1 to l1_1 (the airport in c1).
   - Load p1 into t1 (since t1 is already at l1_2 where p1 is).
   - Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1.
   - Unload p1 at l1_1.
2. Load p1 into airplane a1 (which is at l1_1).
3. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1 (airport in c2).
4. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1.
5. Now, need to get p1 to l2_3. Use truck t2 (which is in l2_1 after previous steps). But t2 was used to move p2 to l2_1. Wait, but after delivering p2 to l2_1, we could use t2 to move p1 from l2_1 to l2_3.

So steps after unloading p1 from a1 at l2_1:

6. Load p1 into t2 at l2_1.
7. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_3.
8. Unload p1 at l2_3. This satisfies the fourth constraint's condition.

Then, after this, we can proceed to move p2 to l2_4. So after step 8, we can load p2 into t2 again (if t2 is at l2_3?), wait, no. Let me re-express.

Wait, after moving p2 to l2_1 (using t2), then t2 is at l2_1. Then, to move p1 from l2_1 to l2_3, we can use t2. So steps:

For p2:

- Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2 (to load p2).
- Load p2 into t2.
- Drive t2 back to l2_1 (unload p2 here to satisfy constraint 1).
- Now, p2 is in l2_1 (unloaded from t2). Then, t2 is at l2_1.

For p1:

- Use t1 to drive to l1_1, unload p1 there.
- Load into a1, fly to l2_1, unload.
- Then, load p1 into t2 (now at l2_1).
- Drive t2 to l2_3, unload p1 (now p1 is in l2_3, satisfying the fourth constraint).
- Then, t2 is at l2_3. But to move p2 from l2_1 to l2_4, we need t2 to be at l2_1 again. So after unloading p1 at l2_3, drive t2 back to l2_1, load p2, then drive to l2_4 and unload.

But this adds more steps. Alternatively, after p2 is in l2_1 (unloaded), and t2 is at l2_1, then perhaps use another truck. Wait, but there are only two trucks: t1 in c1 and t2 in c2. So in c2, only t2 is available.

So steps:

After p2 is unloaded at l2_1 (constraint 1 satisfied), then:

- Load p1 into t2 at l2_1.
- Drive t2 to l2_3, unload p1 (now constraint 4 is satisfied because in this state, p1 is at l2_3).
- Then, drive t2 back to l2_1 (to pick up p2 again).
- Load p2 into t2, drive to l2_4, unload. That would achieve p2's goal.

But then, after that, we need to get p1 back to c1. Because p1's goal is l1_4. So after p1 is in l2_3, how do we get it back?

We need to take p1 from l2_3 to l2_1 (using t2), then load into airplane a2 (which is at l2_1), fly to l1_1, unload, then use t1 to drive to l1_4.

But wait, the airplanes: a1 is at l2_1 after flying there. Or, initial positions: a1 is at l1_1, a2 is at l2_1. So after flying a1 to l2_1, it's there. Then, to return p1 to c1, perhaps use a2. But a2 is initially at l2_1. So after p1 is unloaded at l2_3, then:

- Load p1 into t2, drive to l2_1, unload.
- Load p1 into a2, fly to l1_1.
- Unload p1 into l1_1.
- Then use t1 (which is at l1_1 after previous steps) to drive to l1_4, unload.

This seems possible but adds a lot of steps. Let's check constraints again.

Another constraint is that in at least one state, either p1 is in a2 or p2 is in a1. So during the plan, one of these must be true. For example, when p1 is loaded into a2 for the flight back to c1, that would satisfy the second constraint. Alternatively, if p2 is loaded into a1, but since a1 is in l2_1 after flying there, but p2 is in c2, perhaps loading p2 into a1 and flying somewhere else. But maybe using the step where p1 is loaded into a2 would satisfy the constraint.

So let's outline the entire plan step by step:

1. Move p1 from l1_2 to l1_1 using t1.
   - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
   - drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
   - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

2. Load p1 into a1 and fly to l2_1.
   - loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
   - flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
   - unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

3. Now p1 is at l2_1. Need to take it to l2_3.
   - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (but t2 is initially at l2_1)
   - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
   - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (now constraint 4 is satisfied)

4. Return t2 to l2_1 to handle p2.
   - drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

5. Now handle p2. Move p2 from l2_2 to l2_1 using t2.
   - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
   - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
   - drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
   - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (now constraint 1 is satisfied)

6. Now move p2 to l2_4.
   - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
   - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
   - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (goal for p2 achieved, but after step 3, constraint 4 is already met)

7. Now, bring p1 back to c1. Since p1 is at l2_3, need to move it to l2_1, load into a2, fly to l1_1, then drive to l1_4.
   - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2 (Wait, t2 is at l2_1 after step 5.4. So to get p1 from l2_3 to l2_1, we need to drive t2 back to l2_3, load p1, drive back to l2_1. But t2 is at l2_1 after step 5.4. So steps:

   a. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
   b. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
   c. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
   d. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

   Then load into a2:

   e. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
   f. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
   g. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

   Then move p1 to l1_4 using t1, which is at l1_1 (after step 1):

   h. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
   i. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
   j. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4 (goal achieved)

But this adds a lot of steps, but it's necessary to satisfy all constraints.

Now, check the constraints:

- Constraint 1: p2 is in l2_1 after step 5.4. Check.
- Constraint 2: p1 is loaded into a2 (step 7.e), so "Package p1 is in a2" holds. Check.
- Constraint 3: p2 is in l2_4 in the final state. Check.
- Constraint 4: Before p2 is in l2_4 (step 6.3), there's a state where p1 is in l2_3 (step 3.3). Check.

But the problem is, the plan is quite long. Let me see if there's a way to optimize.

Wait, maybe when moving p2 to l2_1, we can use the same truck t2 to first handle p1. Let me re-order steps.

Alternative approach:

1. Move p1 to l2_3 first, then handle p2.

But p1 is in c1. So steps:

- Drive t1 to l1_1, load p1 into a1, fly to l2_1, unload. Then use t2 to take p1 to l2_3. Then return t2 to l2_1, then handle p2.

But also, when p1 is loaded into a2 (during the return trip), that satisfies the second constraint.

But let's see if there's a shorter path.

Another idea: When moving p2 from l2_2 to l2_1, after loading into t2, before driving back to l2_1, maybe take a detour to l2_3 to drop p1. Wait, no, p1 is in c1. Hmm.

Alternatively, after moving p1 to l2_3, then handle p2. Let's see:

Plan steps:

For p1:

1. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
2. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
3. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
4. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
6. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
7. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
8. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
9. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (constraint 4 satisfied)

For p2:

10. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2 (t2 is now at l2_2)
11. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
12. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 (p2 is now at l2_1, constraint 1 satisfied)
13. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
14. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (since we need to move it to l2_4)
15. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
16. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (p2 goal achieved)

Then, bring p1 back:

17. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2 (but p1 is at l2_3, so load it)
18. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
19. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
20. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
21. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
22. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
23. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
24. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (t1 is at l1_1 from step 2)
25. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
26. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

This plan is very long. But perhaps there's a way to shorten it.

Wait, after step 9 (p1 at l2_3), perhaps instead of driving t2 back to l2_2 to get p2, maybe use another approach. For example, when moving p2 to l2_1, use the same truck.

But t2 is at l2_3 after step 9. To get p2, which is at l2_2, we need to drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_2, load p2, then drive to l2_1, unload (satisfy constraint 1), then drive to l2_4.

So steps:

9. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (p1 is here)

10. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2 (to get p2)
11. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
12. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 (p2 now in l2_1)
13. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (constraint 1 met)
14. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
15. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
16. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (p2 goal)

But after step 16, t2 is at l2_4. Now, to bring p1 back, we need to drive t2 back to l2_3, load p1, drive to l2_1, then load into a2, etc. Which adds steps.

But the problem states that the plan must be optimal, i.e., the shortest possible. So perhaps there's a smarter way.

Another idea: When moving p1 to l2_3, can we combine it with the steps for p2?

Alternatively, when moving p2 to l2_1 (constraint 1), maybe use an airplane. But p2 is in l2_2 (c2). Airplanes move between airports. l2_1 is an airport. So maybe load p2 into an airplane at l2_1? Wait, but p2 is at l2_2. To get to l2_1, use a truck.

Wait, but the constraint requires that p2 is in l2_1. So maybe drive p2 to l2_1 using a truck, then load it into an airplane and fly somewhere else. But the goal for p2 is l2_4, which is in the same city. So maybe not necessary.

Alternatively, when p2 is at l2_1, maybe load it into airplane a1 (which is at l2_1 after flying there earlier?), but that's not needed. But this could satisfy constraint 2 if p2 is loaded into a1. But a1 is in l2_1 after step 5.

Wait, after step 5, a1 is at l2_1. So when p2 is in l2_1 (after being driven there by truck), loading it into a1 would make "p2 is in a1", satisfying constraint 2. Then unload it back into l2_1, and proceed to move to l2_4.

This could save steps. Let's see:

For p2:

After steps 1-9 (p1 is at l2_3):

10. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2 (to get p2)
11. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
12. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 (p2 at l2_1)
13. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (constraint 1)
14. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (now p2 is in a1, satisfying constraint 2)
15. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (p2 back to l2_1)
16. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
17. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
18. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (goal met)

This way, step 14 satisfies constraint 2. So this approach would have fewer steps. But then, we need to check if this works.

So steps would be:

1. Load p1 into t1, drive to l1_1, unload.
2. Load p1 into a1, fly to l2_1, unload.
3. Load p1 into t2, drive to l2_3, unload.
4. Drive t2 to l2_2, load p2.
5. Drive to l2_1, unload p2 (constraint 1).
6. Load p2 into a1 (now p2 is in a1, satisfying constraint 2).
7. Unload p2 back to l2_1.
8. Load p2 into t2, drive to l2_4, unload.
9. Then, bring p1 back.

But this adds steps for loading and unloading into a1. But this might be shorter overall.

But what about the airplane a1's location? After step 2, a1 is at l2_1. So steps 6 and 7 are possible.

So this approach would satisfy constraint 2 by having p2 in a1. Let's see.

But then, after step 6, p2 is in a1 at l2_1. Then step 7 unloads it back to l2_1. Then step 8 loads into t2 and drives to l2_4. This works.

But in this case, steps 6 and 7 are additional steps but allow us to satisfy constraint 2. However, this adds two more steps (load and unload airplane). Alternatively, could we load p1 into a2 during its return trip to satisfy constraint 2?

But how?

After p1 is at l2_3, to return to c1:

- Load p1 into t2, drive to l2_1, unload.
- Load p1 into a2, fly to l1_1.
- Unload p1 into l1_1.
- Drive to l1_4.

Loading p1 into a2 would satisfy constraint 2 (p1 is in a2), which is one of the conditions. So perhaps this is better.

So steps:

1. Move p1 to l2_3 as before.
2. Move p2 to l2_1.
3. Load p2 into t2, drive to l2_4, unload.
4. But during p1's return, load into a2, which satisfies constraint 2.

This way, we don't need to touch a1 for p2. Let's see:

Plan steps for p1:

1. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
2. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
3. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
4. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
6. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
7. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
8. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
9. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (constraint 4 met)

For p2:

10. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2
11. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
12. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 (p2 now at l2_1)
13. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (constraint 1 met)
14. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
15. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
16. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (goal met)

For p1's return:

17. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2 (t2 moves to l2_3)
18. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
19. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
20. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
21. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (now p1 is in a2, satisfying constraint 2)
22. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
23. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
24. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
25. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
26. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4 (goal met)

In this plan, step 21 loads p1 into a2, satisfying constraint 2. The other constraints are already met:

- p2 is in l2_1 at step 13.
- p2 is in l2_4 at step 16.
- Before step 16, p1 was in l2_3 at step 9.

This plan has 26 steps. Is there a way to make it shorter?

Let's see if any steps can be merged or eliminated. For example, after moving p1 to l2_3 (step 9), t2 is at l2_3. To move p2, we need to drive t2 to l2_2 (step 10). Then load p2 and drive to l2_1. Then, after unloading p2 at l2_1 (step 13), we load it back into t2 (step 14) and drive to l2_4.

But maybe instead of unloading p2 at l2_1 (step 13), we could keep it in t2 and drive directly to l2_4. But then, when is constraint 1 (p2 in l2_1) satisfied? It would be satisfied while p2 is in t2 at l2_1, but the problem states that the package is in a location if it's unloaded there. Because the precondition for unloadtruck is that the truck is in the location. So if p2 is in t2 at l2_1, does that count as "in location l2_1"? According to the problem's initial state, packages are in locations, not in vehicles. So the package is in a location only when it's unloaded there. So to satisfy constraint 1, p2 must be unloaded at l2_1. So step 13 is necessary.

Alternatively, perhaps when the truck is at l2_1, the package is considered to be in l2_1? No, the problem's initial state describes packages as being in locations, not in trucks. So a package in a truck is not in a location. Therefore, to have p2 in l2_1, it must be unloaded there.

So step 13 is required.

Is there a way to avoid some back-and-forth driving of t2?

For example, after step 9 (t2 is at l2_3, p1 is there), drive t2 to l2_2, load p2, drive to l2_1, unload p2 (step 13). Then, without unloading, load p2 again and drive to l2_4. But that's not possible because after unloading, p2 is in l2_1. So to load it again, t2 must be in l2_1, which it is after driving there. So steps 13 and 14 are needed.

Alternatively, instead of unloading p2 at l2_1, keep it in t2 and drive to l2_4. But then, p2 would never be in l2_1 (unloaded), so constraint 1 wouldn't be met. So step 13 is necessary.

Another optimization: After step 9, t2 is at l2_3. Instead of driving to l2_2, can we take a different path? No, since p2 is at l2_2.

Hmm. Let's count the steps again in the current plan:

Steps 1-26, but some steps can be reordered. Wait, after step 16, t2 is at l2_4. To get p1 back, steps 17-20 move t2 back to l2_3, load p1, drive to l2_1. But maybe there's a smarter way. For example, after step 16 (t2 at l2_4), can we use another truck? No, only t2 in c2. So t2 has to go back.

Alternatively, after step 16, use an airplane to pick up p1 from l2_3. But airplanes can only land at airports. l2_3 is not an airport. So p1 has to be moved to l2_1 (airport) first via truck.

So steps 17-20 are necessary.

But maybe instead of driving t2 back to l2_3 (step 17), can we use another airplane? For example, after step 9, p1 is at l2_3. Use a different airplane to pick it up. But the only airplanes are a1 and a2. a1 is at l2_1 (after step 5), a2 is at l2_1 (initially). To fly to l2_3, which is not an airport, impossible. So no, must use truck.

So steps 17-20 are necessary.

So the plan is as outlined, with 26 steps. But maybe there's a shorter way.

Wait, let's think differently. What if we use airplane a2 to move p2 from l2_1 to some other airport, but that's unnecessary since the goal is in c2. Alternatively, use a2 to carry p1, which would satisfy constraint 2.

Another Idea: After moving p1 to l2_3, instead of bringing it back via truck and airplane, maybe find a way to leave it there and still satisfy the constraints. But the goal requires p1 to be in l1_4. So no, we have to bring it back.

Alternative approach: Use airplane a2 to carry p1 from l2_1 to l1_1, which would satisfy constraint 2 (p1 in a2).

Wait, during the return trip:

After step 9 (p1 in l2_3), drive t2 to l2_3, load p1, drive to l2_1 (steps 18-20). Then load into a2 (step 21), fly to l1_1 (step 22), unload (step 23). Then drive to l1_4 (steps 24-26). This is necessary.

But is there a way to combine steps?

For example, after step 16 (p2 delivered to l2_4), t2 is at l2_4. So steps 17-20 require moving t2 to l2_3, load p1, back to l2_1. But perhaps after step 16, t2 can go directly to l2_3, but that would require:

17. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2
18. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
19. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
20. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

Then proceed with loading into a2.

This is the same as before.

I think this is the shortest possible, given the constraints. But let's count the steps:

1. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
2. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
3. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
4. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
6. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
7. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
8. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
9. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
10. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2
11. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
12. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
13. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
14. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
15. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
16. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
17. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2
18. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
19. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
20. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
21. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
22. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
23. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
24. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
25. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
26. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

That's 26 actions. But maybe some steps can be optimized. For example, after step 9 (p1 at l2_3), can we use another truck to move p2? No, only t2 is available in c2. So steps are necessary.

Alternatively, can we avoid driving t2 back and forth by combining movements?

For example, after step 9 (t2 at l2_3), instead of driving to l2_2 to get p2, maybe fly p2 using an airplane. But p2 is in l2_2, which is not an airport. So no.

Another Idea: When moving p2 from l2_2 to l2_1 (steps 10-13), perhaps after loading p2 into t2, drive directly to l2_4 instead of l2_1. But then p2 would not be in l2_1, violating constraint 1. So no.

Alternatively, after step 13 (p2 unloaded at l2_1), can we load p2 into an airplane and fly to l2_4's airport? But l2_4 is not an airport. Airplanes can only land at airports. So no.

Therefore, the plan must include these steps. Hence, the optimal plan would be 26 steps. But this seems very long. Perhaps there's a smarter way.

Wait, maybe when moving p1 back to c1, instead of using a2, use a1. But a1 is at l2_1. So after step 6, a1 is at l2_1. If we load p1 into a1 and fly back to l1_1, then that would also work. But then, during the flight back, p1 is in a1. Does this satisfy constraint 2? The constraint requires that either p1 is in a2 or p2 is in a1. If we use a1 to carry p1 back, then during that time, p1 is in a1. But that's not one of the options. The constraint requires p1 in a2 or p2 in a1. So using a1 to carry p1 doesn't help. Therefore, we need to have p1 in a2 or p2 in a1.

So using a2 to carry p1 is necessary to satisfy constraint 2. Hence, step 21 is needed.

Another Idea: During the initial movement of p1 to l2_1, perhaps load it into a2 instead of a1. But a2 is at l2_1 initially. Wait, no. a2 is at l2_1 (airport in c2). To get p1 from c1 to c2, we need to use an airplane that can fly from c1's airport (l1_1) to c2's airport (l2_1). a1 is in l1_1 initially. So we have to use a1 to fly p1 to l2_1. Then, when returning, use a2 to fly back. This way, when p1 is loaded into a2 (step 21), it satisfies constraint 2.

Yes, that's what the current plan does.

Given all this, I think the plan outlined is the optimal one, but perhaps there's a shorter version I'm missing.

Wait, another Idea: The constraint 2 requires that in at least one state, either p1 is in a2 or p2 is in a1. In the current plan, p1 is loaded into a2 (step 21), so that satisfies it. Alternatively, during the movement of p2, if we load p2 into a1, that would also satisfy it. For example, after step 13 (p2 in l2_1), load p2 into a1 (step 14), then unload it (step 15), then load into t2 and drive to l2_4. This would satisfy constraint 2 with p2 in a1.

So steps:

13. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
14. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (now p2 is in a1)
15. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
16. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
17. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
18. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

This way, step 14 satisfies constraint 2. This approach saves steps compared to the previous plan, because we don't have to load p1 into a2.

But then, how does p1 get back to c1? We would still need to load p1 into a2, but maybe we can avoid that.

Wait, if p2 is loaded into a1 (step 14), then the constraint 2 is satisfied. Then, when returning p1 to c1, we can use a1 again. But a1 is already at l2_1. So:

After step 9 (p1 at l2_3):

10. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2
11. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
12. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
13. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
14. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (constraint 2 satisfied)
15. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
16. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
17. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
18. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

For p1's return:

19. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2
20. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
21. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
22. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
23. loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
24. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
25. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
26. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
27. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
28. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

But this adds more steps (28 vs 26). But the previous plan had 26 steps but used a2 for p1's return. So which is shorter? Let's compare.

Original plan uses a2 for p1's return: 26 steps.

Alternative plan using a1 for p2 and a1 for p1's return: 28 steps.

So original plan is shorter.

Another Idea: After step 14 (load p2 into a1), can we fly a1 to l1_1 with p2, then unload there, then fly back? But that's unnecessary and adds steps. Not helpful.

Alternatively, after step 14 (p2 in a1), can we fly a1 to l2_4's airport? But l2_4 is not an airport. Airplanes can only land at airports. So no.

So the original plan is better.

Let me count the steps again for the original plan:

Steps 1-26, but let's recheck:

Wait, after step 16 (unload p2 at l2_4), t2 is at l2_4. Then steps 17-20 involve moving t2 to l2_3, load p1, drive back to l2_1. Then steps 21-23 load into a2 and fly back. Then steps 24-26 drive to l1_4.

Total steps: 26.

Is there a way to avoid moving t2 back to l2_3 after delivering p2? For example, after step 16, t2 is at l2_4. To get p1 from l2_3 to l2_1, we need another truck, but there is none. So t2 must go back.

Alternatively, can we use a different truck in c1? No, trucks are city-bound. t1 is in c1.

Thus, this seems unavoidable.

I think this is the optimal plan given the constraints. However, it's possible that I'm missing a shorter path. For example, perhaps combining the movement of p1 and p2 in some way. Let's think:

What if after step 9 (p1 at l2_3), t2 is at l2_3. Then, drive t2 to l2_1, load p2, drive to l2_4. But p2 is at l2_2. So no.

Alternatively, when t2 is at l2_3, drive to l2_2, load p2, drive to l2_4, but then p2 would not go through l2_1. But we need to have p2 in l2_1.

So this approach won't work.

Given all this, I think the initial plan is the shortest possible. But I'll write the steps in the required format.
