Let me break down this problem:

**Initial State**:
- Package p1 is in location l2_5 (in city c2)
- Package p2 is in location l2_2 (in city c2)
- Truck t1 is in location l1_2 (in city c1)
- Truck t2 is in location l2_1 (in city c2)
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (in city c1's airport)
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1 (in city c2's airport)

**Goal**:
- Package p1 is in location l1_1 (city c1's airport)
- Package p2 is in location l1_4 (in city c1)

**Constraints**:
1. At some point, either p1 must be in l1_2 or p2 must be in l2_3.
2. At some point, p2 must be in l2_1 (city c2's airport).
3. Before p2 is in l2_1, either p2 must be in l2_3 or p1 must be in l1_3.
4. At some point, p2 must be in l1_4 (which is part of the goal).
5. Before p2 is in l1_4, either p1 must be in l1_3 or p2 must be in l2_4.

Let's first think about a high-level plan:

Package p1 needs to go from l2_5 to l1_1. This will involve:
1. Using truck t2 to move p1 from l2_5 to l2_1 (the airport).
2. Using an airplane to move p1 from l2_1 to l1_1.

Package p2 needs to go from l2_2 to l1_4. This will involve:
1. Using truck t2 to move p2 from l2_2 to l2_1 (the airport).
2. Using an airplane to move p2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
3. Using truck t1 to move p2 from l1_1 to l1_4.

Now, let's consider the constraints and adjust our plan:

1. Either p1 must be in l1_2 or p2 must be in l2_3: 
   We can either move p1 to l1_2 after it arrives in city c1, or move p2 to l2_3 in city c2.

2. p2 must be in l2_1: 
   This is already part of our plan, as p2 needs to go to the airport to fly to city c1.

3. Before p2 is in l2_1, either p2 must be in l2_3 or p1 must be in l1_3:
   We need to ensure one of these conditions is met before we move p2 to l2_1.

4. p2 must be in l1_4: 
   This is part of the goal.

5. Before p2 is in l1_4, either p1 must be in l1_3 or p2 must be in l2_4:
   We need to ensure one of these conditions is met before we move p2 to l1_4.

Given the constraints, I'm thinking of moving p2 to l2_3 first (to satisfy constraint 3), then to l2_1, then to l1_1, and finally to l1_4. For p1, I'm thinking of moving it directly from l2_5 to l2_1, then to l1_1. This should satisfy the constraints.

Let me now detail the plan step by step.

Wait, I need to correct something from my initial state understanding:

Confusion arise from:
"Package t1 is in location l1_2"
"Package t2 is in location l2_1"
"Package a1 is in location l1_1"
"Package a2 is in location l2_1"

But t1 and t2 are trucks, and a1 and a2 are airplanes. So the initial state should be:

- Package p1 is in location l2_5 (in city c2)
- Package p2 is in location l2_2 (in city c2)
- Truck t1 is in location l1_2 (in city c1)
- Truck t2 is in location l2_1 (in city c2)
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (in city c1's airport)
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1 (in city c2's airport)

Now, let's proceed.

First, let's ensure constraint 3: Before p2 is in l2_1, either p2 must be in l2_3 or p1 must be in l1_3.

Let's choose to move p2 to l2_3:
1. Move truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_2.
2. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_2.
3. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_3.
4. (No need to unload p2 yet)

This partially satisfies constraint 1 as well (at least one of p1 in l1_2 or p2 in l2_3).

Now, let's move p2 to l2_1 to satisfy constraint 2:
5. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1.
6. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1.

Now, let's ensure constraint 5: Before p2 is in l1_4, either p1 must be in l1_3 or p2 must be in l2_4.

Let's move p2 to l2_4:
7. Load p2 into t2 at l2_1.
8. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4.
9. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_4.

This partially satisfies constraint 5.

Now, let's move p1 to l1_1:
10. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_5.
11. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_5.
12. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1.
13. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1.
14. Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1.
15. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
16. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1.

Now, let's move p2 to l1_4 (part of the goal):
17. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_4.
18. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
19. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1.
20. Load p2 onto a2 at l2_1.
21. Fly a2 from l1_1 back to l2_1.
22. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1 with p2.
23. Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1.
24. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1.
25. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_1.
26. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_4.
27. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_4.

Hmm, looking at this plan, it seems overly complex. Let's redo it with some adjustments:

First, let's move p2 to l2_3 to satisfy constraint 3:
1. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2.
2. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_2.
3. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_3.
4. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_3.

Now, let's move p2 to l2_1 to satisfy constraint 2:
5. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_3.
6. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1.
7. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1.

Next, let's move p2 to l2_4 to help satisfy constraint 5:
8. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_1.
9. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4.
10. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_4.

Now, let's move p1 to l1_1 (part of the goal):
11. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_5.
12. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_5.
13. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1.
14. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1.
15. Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1.
16. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
17. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1.

Finally, let's move p2 to l1_4 (part of the goal):
18. Fly a2 from l1_1 to l2_1.
19. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4.
20. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_4.
21. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
22. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1.
23. Load p2 onto a2 at l2_1.
24. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
25. Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1.
26. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1.
27. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_1.
28. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_4.
29. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_4.

Actually, I think we still want to consider constraint 5 more carefully: "Before p2 is in l1_4, either p1 must be in l1_3 or p2 must be in l2_4". We're already moving p2 through l2_4, so that should cover this constraint.

Let's also check the other constraints:
- Constraint 1: At some point, either p1 must be in l1_2 or p2 must be in l2_3. We've moved p2 to l2_3, so this is satisfied.
- Constraint 2: At some point, p2 must be in l2_1. We've moved p2 to l2_1, so this is satisfied.
- Constraint 3: Before p2 is in l2_1, either p2 must be in l2_3 or p1 must be in l1_3. We've moved p2 to l2_3 before it reaches l2_1, so this is satisfied.
- Constraint 4: At some point, p2 must be in l1_4. This is part of the goal and our plan.
- Constraint 5: Before p2 is in l1_4, either p1 must be in l1_3 or p2 must be in l2_4. We've moved p2 to l2_4, so this is satisfied.

In reviewing the plan, I notice some potential optimizations (for example we can merge steps 18 and 19, for example). Let me revise the plan to be more efficient.

Actually, I noticed another issue. We need to ensure that p2 passes through l2_4 *before* it reaches l1_4 (the goal). Let's adjust the plan.

Let's do the plan again in a cleaner way:

1. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2.
2. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_2.
3. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_3. (This satisfies constraint 1)
4. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1. (This satisfies constraint 3, and helps with constraint 2)
5. Unload p2 from t2, at l2_1. (This satisfies constraint 2)
6. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_1.
7. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4. (This helps with constraint 5)
8. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_4.
9. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_5.
10. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_5.
11. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1.
12. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1.
13. Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1.
14. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
15. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1. (Half of our goal)
16. Fly a2 from l1_1 to l2_1.
17. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_4 (Wait, this doesn't make sense, t2 is at l2_1).

Let me redo this from step 16:

16. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_4.
17. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
18. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1.
19. Load p2 onto a2 at l2_1.
20. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
21. Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1.
22. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1.
23. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_1.
24. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_4.
25. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_4. (Second half of our goal)

Hmm, but with the way we've broken up the steps, t2 won't be at l2_4 when we need it to transport p2. Let's adjust.

Alright, I'm going to adjust the plan one more time, being more careful about the locations of vehicles:

1. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2.
2. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_2.
3. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_3. (This satisfies constraint 1)
4. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1. (This satisfies constraint 3, and helps with constraint 2)
5. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1. (This satisfies constraint 2)
6. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_5.
7. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_5.
8. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1.
9. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1.
10. Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1.
11. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
12. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1. (Half of our goal)
13. Fly a2 from l1_1 to l2_1.
14. Load p2 onto a2 at l2_1.
15. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4.  (Steps 15-17 are to ensure constraint 5 is satisfied)
16. Unload p2 from a2 at l2_1.
17. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_1.

Wait, I made a mistake. I need to be even more careful with the locations of the objects and the sequences. Let me redo this.

1. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2.
2. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_2.
3. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_3. (This satisfies constraint 1)
4. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1. (This satisfies constraint 3, and helps with constraint 2)
5. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1. (This satisfies constraint 2)
6. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_5.
7. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_5.
8. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1.
9. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1.
10. Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1.
11. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_1.
12. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4. (This helps with constraint 5)
13. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_4.
14. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
15. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1. (Half of our goal)
16. Fly a2 from l1_1 to l2_1.
17. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
18. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_4.

Wait, I made a mistake again. Actually, I think the problem is that I'm splitting up my attention too much. Let me go more systematically.

We have two packages, p1 in l2_5 and p2 in l2_2, both in city c2. We want to move p1 to l1_1 and p2 to l1_4 (both in city c1). 

First, let's handle the constraints and plan p2's journey:
1. Move p2 from l2_2 to l2_3 (satisfying constraint 1).
2. Move p2 from l2_3 to l2_1 (satisfying constraint 3 and then constraint 2).
3. Move p2 from l2_1 to l2_4 (satisfying constraint 5).
4. Fly p2 from city c2 to city c1.
5. Move p2 to l1_4 (the goal).

Next, plan p1's journey:
1. Move p1 from l2_5 to l2_1.
2. Fly p1 from l2_1 to l1_1 (the goal).

OK, now let's implement this with the vehicles.

For p2's journey:
1. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2.
2. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_2.
3. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_3 (satisfying constraint 1).
4. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1 (satisfying constraint 3).
5. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1 (satisfying constraint 2).
6. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_1.
7. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4.
8. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_4 (helping satisfy constraint 5).
9. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.

For p1's journey:
10. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_5.
11. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_5.
12. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1.
13. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1.
14. Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1.
15. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
16. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1 (half of our goal).

Continue with p2's journey:
17. Fly a2 from l1_1 to l2_1.
18. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4.
19. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_4.
20. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
21. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1.
22. Load p2 onto a2 at l2_1.
23. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
24. Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1.
25. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1.
26. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_1.
27. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_4.
28. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_4 (second half of our goal).

OK, let me now double-check that this plan satisfies all the constraints:

Constraint 1: At some point, either p1 must be in l1_2 or p2 must be in l2_3. We move p2 to l2_3 in step 3. Satisfied.

Constraint 2: At some point, p2 must be in l2_1. We have p2 in l2_1 in step 5. Satisfied.

Constraint 3: Before p2 is in l2_1, either p2 must be in l2_3 or p1 must be in l1_3. We move p2 to l2_3 (step 3) before it reaches l2_1 (step 5). Satisfied.

Constraint 4: At some point, p2 must be in l1_4. We achieve this in step 28. Satisfied.

Constraint 5: Before p2 is in l1_4, either p1 must be in l1_3 or p2 must be in l2_4. We move p2 to l2_4 (step 8) before it reaches l1_4 (step 28). Satisfied.

Alright, let's format the plan clearly now. I will try to write the formally correct action names as per the problem description.

1. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
4. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
5. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
6. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
7. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
8. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
9. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
10. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
11. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
12. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
13. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
14. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
15. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
16. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
17. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
18. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
19. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
20. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
21. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
22. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
23. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
24. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
25. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
26. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
27. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
28. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

One moment, I think there's a typo:

"unloadairplane p ap l": Unload package p from airplane ap in location l.
But loadairplane is also defined as "loadairplane p ap l"

I'll assume that one of them should be "unloadairplane p ap l" based on the context.

Let me also carefully check and make sure the constraints and timeline are all satisfied with my final plan.

Actually I'm seeing an issue with steps 6 through 9. Let's see:
- We unload p2 from t2 at l2_1 in step 5 and immediately reload it in step 6. It's not a logical contradiction but it seems unnecessary.
- Then in steps 7 and 8, we take p2 to l2_4 and unload it, only to immediately leave p2 there and move t2 back to l2_1 in step 9. This means we're effectively abandoning p2 in l2_4, which might not be what we want.

It could be that we're just dropping p2 off at l2_4 to satisfy constraint 5, and we'll come back for it later. But, from a planning perspective, I can probably make this more efficient.

Alright, for clarity, let's redo the plan carefully step by step:

1. We need to move p2 from l2_2 to l2_3 (to satisfy constraint 1 and for constraint 3).
2. We then need to move p2 to l2_1 (for constraint 2).
3. After that, we need to move p2 to l2_4 (for constraint 5).
4. We also need to move p1 from l2_5 to l1_1 (goal).
5. Finally, we need to move p2 from l2_4 to l1_4 (goal).

Now, let's implement this using the vehicles:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2 (satisfying constraint 1)
4. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2 (satisfying constraint 3)
5. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (satisfying constraint 2)
6. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
7. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
8. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
9. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
10. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
11. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
12. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (half of our goal)
13. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
14. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
15. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
16. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (helping satisfy constraint 5)
17. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

Oops! I made a mistake. If I unload p2 at l2_4, the truck t2 is at l2_4, and a2 is at l2_1. I made an error on step 17. I'm going to restart.

I'll keep it very systematic and track the locations of each object throughout.

Initial Locations:
- Package p1: l2_5 (city c2)
- Package p2: l2_2 (city c2)
- Truck t1: l1_2 (city c1)
- Truck t2: l2_1 (city c2)

Action 15: unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
- p1 is now at l1_1

Half of the goal satisfied: p1 is at l1_1.

Action 16: flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
- a2 is now at l2_1

Action 17: drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
- t2 is now at l2_4

Second half of the goal satisfied: p2 is at l1_4.
Constraint 4 Satisfied: p2 is at l1_4.
Constraint 5 Fully Satisfied: p2 was at l2_4 before reaching l1_4.

Double-checking, we've satisfied all constraints:
1. At some point, either p1 must be in l1_2 or p2 must be in l2_3. Satisfied by p2 being in l2_3 in action 3.
2. At some point, p2 must be in l2_1. Satisfied by action 5.
3. Before p2 is in l2_1, either p2 must be in l2_3 or p1 must be in l1_3. Satisfied by p2 being in l2_3 in action 3 before it's in l2_1 in action 5.
4. At some point, p2 must be in l1_4. Satisfied by the result of action 27.
5. Before p2 is in l1_4, either p1 must be in l1_3 or p2 must be in l2_4. Satisfied by p2 being in l2_4 in action 8 before it's in l1_4 in action 27.

I think this plan is optimal, given the constraints and the goal. I'm going to list the final plan for clarity:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
4. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
5. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
6. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
7. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
8. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
9. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2
10. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
11. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
12. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
13. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
14. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
15. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
16. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
17. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
18. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
19. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
20. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
21. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
22. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
23. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
24. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
25. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
26. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
27. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
