Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. Hmm, the goal is to get p1 to l1_1 and p2 to l1_4. But there are several constraints to satisfy. Let me start by understanding the initial state and the constraints.

First, initial state:
- p1 is in l2_5 (city c2)
- p2 is in l2_2 (city c2)
- Trucks t1 is in l1_2 (c1), t2 in l2_1 (c2)
- Airplanes a1 in l1_1 (c1's airport), a2 in l2_1 (c2's airport)

So, p1 is in c2, needs to get to c1's airport l1_1. Since airplanes can fly between airports, maybe use a2 to carry p1 from c2 to c1? But wait, a1 is already in c1's airport. Wait, but p1 is in c2. So maybe load p1 into a2 at l2_1, fly it to l1_1, then unload. But how does p1 get to l2_1 first? Because p1 is in l2_5. So in c2, need to use truck t2 to move p1 from l2_5 to l2_1 (the airport). But wait, t2 is in l2_1 initially. Wait, the original state says "Package t1 is in location l1_2" and "Package t2 is in location l2_1". Wait, maybe that's a typo? Because t1 and t2 are trucks, not packages. Wait, looking back, the original state says:

"Package t1 is in location l1_2"
"Package t2 is in location l2_1"

Wait, that can't be right. Because t1 and t2 are trucks. Oh, maybe that's a mistake in the problem statement. Because in the objects listed, t1 and t2 are trucks. So perhaps the original state should say "Truck t1 is in location l1_2" and "Truck t2 is in location l2_1". Otherwise, if they're packages, that's conflicting with the other packages. This might be a critical error. But assuming that's a typo, and the trucks are in those locations. Because otherwise, if t1 and t2 are packages, then we have more packages than listed, which includes p1, p2, t1, t2, a1, a2. But the problem says the packages are p1 and p2. So perhaps the original state's entries for t1 and t2 are incorrect, and they should be trucks in those locations.

Assuming that:
- Truck t1 is in l1_2 (c1)
- Truck t2 is in l2_1 (c2)
- Airplanes a1 in l1_1 (c1), a2 in l2_1 (c2)
- Packages p1 in l2_5, p2 in l2_2.

So, for p1 to get to l1_1 (c1's airport), which is an airport in city c1. Since airplanes can fly between airports, perhaps we need to transport p1 from l2_5 to l2_1 (the airport in c2) using truck t2, then load it onto airplane a2, fly to l1_1, unload, and then maybe use truck t1 to move it if needed. Wait, but the goal is for p1 to be in l1_1, which is an airport. So if we unload it there, that's done.

For p2, which is in l2_2 (c2). The goal is to get it to l1_4 (c1). So that's a different city. So again, need to transport p2 to c1. How? Maybe via airplane. But p2 is in c2. So first, move p2 from l2_2 to l2_1 (airport) using truck t2, load onto airplane a2, fly to l1_1, then unload. Then use truck t1 to move it from l1_1 to l1_4. Wait, but l1_1 is in city c1, so truck t1 can drive within c1's locations.

Wait, but t1 is in l1_2 initially. So perhaps drive t1 to l1_1 to load p2, then drive to l1_4. But that would require multiple steps.

But let's outline the steps for p1:

1. Move p1 from l2_5 to l2_1 (airport in c2). Since p1 is in l2_5, which is in c2. Truck t2 is in l2_1. So we need to get the truck to l2_5. Wait, t2 is in l2_1. So the truck is in the airport. To get p1 from l2_5 to l2_1, need to drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_5 (city c2), load p1, then drive back to l2_1, unload, then load onto airplane.

Wait, but trucks can move between locations in their city. So t2 can drive from l2_1 to l2_5 via other locations. Are there intermediate steps? For example, l2_1 is the airport. Then locations l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5. So perhaps t2 can drive from l2_1 to l2_2, then l2_3, etc., but that would take multiple steps. But the problem says the plan must be optimal (shortest possible). So is there a direct drive? The drivetruck action allows moving from any location to another in the same city. So yes, we can drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_5 directly.

Wait, the drivetruck action is "drivetruck t l_from l_to c". So as long as l_from and l_to are in the same city, the truck can move directly. So for t2 in c2, moving from l2_1 to l2_5 is allowed in one action.

So steps for p1:

- Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_5 (c2)
- Load p1 into t2 at l2_5
- Drive t2 back to l2_1
- Unload p1 at l2_1
- Load p1 onto airplane a2 (which is at l2_1)
- Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1
- Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1

That gets p1 to l1_1.

Now for p2: need to get to l1_4 in c1.

p2 is in l2_2 (c2). So similar steps: move to l2_1 via truck t2, load onto airplane, fly to l1_1, then use truck t1 (in c1) to move to l1_4.

But t1 is initially at l1_2. So need to drive t1 to l1_1, load p2, drive to l1_4, unload.

But wait, after p2 is flown to l1_1, it's in the airport. So steps:

For p2:

- Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2 (c2)
- Load p2 into t2 at l2_2
- Drive t2 back to l2_1
- Unload p2 at l2_1
- Load p2 onto airplane a2 (which is at l2_1)
- Fly a2 to l1_1 (but wait, a2 is in l2_1, can fly to l1_1 (which is in c1, an airport)
- Unload p2 at l1_1
- Then, drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1
- Load p2 into t1
- Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_4
- Unload p2 at l1_4

That would work. But this seems like a lot of steps. Also, we need to check the constraints.

Constraints:

1. At least one state has p1 in l1_2 or p2 in l2_3. So during the plan, either at some point p1 is in l1_2 or p2 is in l2_3.

2. At least one state has p2 in l2_1.

3. If p2 is in l2_1 in some state, there must be an earlier state where p2 is in l2_3 or p1 is in l1_3.

4. At least one state has p2 in l1_4 (which is the goal, so that's satisfied)

5. If p2 is in l1_4, there must be an earlier state where p1 is in l1_3 or p2 is in l2_4.

So need to make sure these constraints are met.

Let's check the constraints in the tentative plan.

First, for constraint 2: p2 must be in l2_1 at some state. In the plan, when we unload p2 from t2 into l2_1, that's one state. So that's covered.

Constraint 3: When p2 is in l2_1 (after unloading from truck), there must be an earlier state where p2 was in l2_3 or p1 in l1_3. But in our current plan, p2 is moved from l2_2 to l2_1 via truck. So the path is l2_2 → l2_1. So p2 never goes through l2_3. So this would violate constraint 3. Because when p2 is in l2_1 (after being unloaded), we need to have had an earlier state where p2 is in l2_3 or p1 in l1_3. But in the current plan, neither happens. So we need to adjust the plan.

So perhaps, for p2, instead of driving directly from l2_2 to l2_1, we need to go through l2_3. So drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_3, unload p2 there (so p2 is in l2_3), then load again into t2, drive to l2_1. That way, p2 is in l2_3 at some point. Then when it's later in l2_1, the constraint 3 is satisfied because earlier p2 was in l2_3. Also, this would satisfy constraint 1 (since p2 is in l2_3). So maybe:

For p2:

- Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2 (c2)
- Load p2 into t2 at l2_2
- Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_3 (c2)
- Unload p2 at l2_3 (now p2 is in l2_3)
- Load p2 into t2 at l2_3
- Drive t2 to l2_1
- Unload p2 at l2_1
- Then load onto airplane, etc.

But this adds steps. But it's necessary to meet constraint 3 and 1.

Similarly, constraint 5: when p2 is in l1_4 (the goal), there must be an earlier state where p1 is in l1_3 or p2 in l2_4. So in the current plan, after moving p2 to l1_4 via truck t1 from l1_1, perhaps during the movement, we need to pass through l1_3. For example, drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_3, then to l1_4. That way, p2 is in l1_3, which would satisfy the condition.

Alternatively, during the transport of p1, maybe have it go through l1_3.

Wait, p1's path is: after being flown to l1_1, it's unloaded there. The goal is to have it in l1_1, so no further movement needed. So perhaps p1 is in l1_1 at the end. But if we need to have p1 in l1_3 at some point, that would require moving it there and back, which adds steps and may not be optimal. So maybe better to have p2 go through l2_4 during its transport.

Alternatively, for p2's journey in c2, after being in l2_3, drive to l2_4 before going to l2_1. That would make p2 be in l2_4, which could satisfy constraint 5. Let's see.

So revised steps for p2:

- Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2
- Load p2 into t2 at l2_2
- Drive t2 to l2_3, unload (so p2 is in l2_3) → meets constraint 1 and 3
- Load p2 into t2 again, drive to l2_4 (so p2 is in l2_4 when unloaded?), but wait, if we unload there, that would take more steps. But maybe just drive through l2_3 to l2_4, but need to check how.

Alternatively, during p2's transport to l2_1, after being in l2_3, drive to l2_4, then to l2_1. So steps:

For p2:

1. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2
2. Load p2 into t2
3. Drive t2 to l2_3 (unload here? No, because then p2 is in l2_3, which meets constraint 1 and helps with constraint 3)
   - Unload p2 at l2_3 (now p2 is here)
4. Then load p2 into t2 again
5. Drive t2 to l2_4 (so p2 is now in l2_4)
6. Unload p2 here (now in l2_4)
7. Load into t2 again
8. Drive to l2_1
9. Unload at l2_1

But this would add multiple steps, but maybe needed for constraints.

But constraint 5 says that if p2 is in l1_4 (the goal), there must be an earlier state where p1 is in l1_3 or p2 is in l2_4. So if p2 is in l2_4 during its transport, that would satisfy this. So during the steps above, if p2 is unloaded at l2_4, then when later it's in l1_4, the constraint is satisfied. But in this case, during step 6, p2 is in l2_4. So that's an earlier state. So that works.

But this adds more steps, which may conflict with the optimality condition. So we need to find the minimal steps that satisfy all constraints.

Alternatively, maybe during the transportation of p2 from l2_2 to l2_1 via l2_3 and l2_4, but without unloading. Wait, but the truck can carry the package through multiple locations without unloading. But the constraints require that p2 is in l2_3 or l2_4 at some state. So just driving through those locations while the package is in the truck doesn't place the package in the location. So the package is in the truck, not the location. Therefore, to have p2 in l2_3 or l2_4, we need to unload it there.

So perhaps:

For p2:

1. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2 (load p2)
2. Load p2 into t2 at l2_2
3. Drive t2 to l2_3
4. Unload p2 at l2_3 (now p2 is here, meeting constraint 1 and 3)
5. Load p2 into t2 again
6. Drive t2 to l2_4
7. Unload p2 at l2_4 (now p2 is here, which helps with constraint 5)
8. Load p2 into t2 again
9. Drive t2 to l2_1
10. Unload p2 at l2_1 (now meets constraint 2)

But this is a lot of steps, but maybe necessary. Then proceed to load onto airplane, fly to l1_1, then truck to l1_4.

But this might not be optimal. Let's think of a way to minimize steps while satisfying all constraints.

Alternative approach: for p2, after loading into t2 at l2_2, drive to l2_3, unload there (so p2 is in l2_3). Then load again and drive to l2_1. Then fly to l1_1. Then truck to l1_4. But for constraint 5, when p2 is in l1_4, need to have had p2 in l2_4 or p1 in l1_3. So in this case, p2 was in l2_3 but not l2_4, and p1 may not be in l1_3. So that would not satisfy constraint 5. So we need to ensure that either p2 is in l2_4 or p1 is in l1_3 before p2 is in l1_4.

So perhaps during p1's transport, make it go through l1_3. But p1's goal is l1_1. So if we unload p1 from the airplane at l1_1, that's done. But to get p1 to l1_3, we would have to load it into truck t1 and drive there, but that's extra steps. So maybe:

After p1 is unloaded at l1_1, load it into t1, drive to l1_3, unload, then drive back to l1_1. But that would make p1 be in l1_3, satisfying the condition for constraint 5. But this adds steps. But perhaps necessary.

Alternatively, during the transport of p2 to l1_4, have the truck drive through l1_3. For example, after p2 is unloaded at l1_1 (from the airplane), load into t1, drive to l1_3, unload (so p2 is in l1_3), then load again and drive to l1_4. But that would make p2 be in l1_3, which doesn't help with constraint 5 (needs p2 in l2_4 or p1 in l1_3). If p2 is in l1_3, that's not one of the required conditions. So no. Therefore, to satisfy constraint 5, we need p2 to be in l2_4 at some point.

So, to satisfy constraint 5, p2 must be in l2_4 at some state before it's in l1_4. Therefore, in the plan, during the transportation of p2 in c2, it must be unloaded in l2_4.

So steps for p2:

- Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2, load p2.
- Drive to l2_3, unload (meets constraint 1 and 3)
- Load again, drive to l2_4, unload (meets constraint 5's required condition)
- Load again, drive to l2_1, unload.
- Then load onto airplane, fly to l1_1.
- Load into t1, drive to l1_4, unload.

But this adds several steps, but maybe it's necessary.

Alternatively, perhaps combine steps. For example, after driving t2 to l2_2 and loading p2, drive to l2_3, unload (p2 in l2_3), then load, drive to l2_4, unload (p2 in l2_4), then load, drive to l2_1, unload. Then fly to l1_1, truck to l1_4.

But each unload and load adds steps. Let's count:

For p2's movement in c2:

1. Drive t2 l2_1 → l2_2 (c2)
2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (p2 here)
5. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
6. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
7. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (p2 here)
8. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
9. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
10. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

Then, load onto airplane:

11. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
12. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
13. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

Then, transport to l1_4:

14. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 (t1 starts at l1_2)
15. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
16. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
17. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

Similarly, p1's steps:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
3. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
5. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
6. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
7. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

But wait, airplane a2 is initially at l2_1. So steps 5-7 for p1 are possible. Then after flying to l1_1, a2 is there. Then for p2's flight, steps 11-13 would require a2 to be back at l2_1. But after flying to l1_1, a2 is there. So unless we fly it back, which would take steps. But that's a problem. Because after transporting p1, a2 is in l1_1. Then for p2's transport, we can't use a2 unless we fly it back to l2_1. But that would require another fly action. So this complicates the plan.

Alternatively, use different airplanes. The problem states there are airplanes a1 and a2. a1 is in l1_1 initially, and a2 is in l2_1. So for p1, perhaps use a2 to fly from l2_1 to l1_1. Then for p2, use a1 to fly from l1_1 to l2_1. Wait, but a1 starts in l1_1. So to get a1 to l2_1, need to fly it there, which would take steps. Let's see.

Alternative plan:

For p1:

1. Use truck t2 to move p1 from l2_5 to l2_1 (as before)
   - drive t2 to l2_5, load, drive back to l2_1, unload.
2. Load p1 onto a2 (at l2_1)
3. Fly a2 to l1_1, unload. Now a2 is in l1_1.

For p2:

1. Use truck t2 to move p2 from l2_2 to l2_3 (unload there)
2. Load again, drive to l2_4 (unload there)
3. Load again, drive to l2_1, unload.
4. Now need to fly p2 to l1_1. But a2 is now in l1_1. So need to use a different airplane. a1 is in l1_1. So:

   a. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1. Then load p2 onto a1, fly back to l1_1. But this adds steps.

Alternatively, after moving p2 to l2_1, load onto a1 (but a1 is in l1_1). So we can't. So unless we fly a1 to l2_1 first. So steps:

For p2:

After step 3 (p2 in l2_1):

4. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1 (empty)
5. load p2 onto a1 at l2_1
6. fly a1 to l1_1
7. unload p2 at l1_1
8. Then use truck t1 to move to l1_4.

But this adds flying steps for a1. So the total plan is getting longer. But maybe necessary.

Alternatively, use a2 to transport both packages. But after transporting p1, a2 is in l1_1. To transport p2, we need to fly a2 back to l2_1. But that would take:

After step 7 (unload p1 at l1_1), fly a2 back to l2_1 (empty), then load p2 and fly to l1_1 again. But this adds two more steps.

So this would be:

For p1:

1. Drive t2 to l2_5, load, drive back to l2_1, unload.
2. load into a2, fly to l1_1, unload.

For p2:

3. Drive t2 to l2_2, load, drive to l2_3, unload (constraint 1 and 3)
4. load, drive to l2_4, unload (constraint 5)
5. load, drive to l2_1, unload.
6. Now, need to get a2 back to l2_1. Fly a2 from l1_1 to l2_1.
7. load p2 into a2, fly to l1_1, unload.
8. Then drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1, load p2, drive to l1_4, unload.

But this adds steps 6 and 7, which may be necessary.

But this makes the plan longer. Let's count steps for this approach.

But maybe there's a smarter way. Let's think about using airplanes a1 and a2.

a1 is initially in l1_1. a2 in l2_1.

So for p1:

- Use a2 to fly from l2_1 to l1_1 with p1.

For p2:

- Use a1 to fly from l1_1 to l2_1 (empty), then load p2, fly back to l1_1.

But this requires flying a1 to l2_1, which takes steps. Let's see:

For p1:

1. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_5 (c2)
2. load p1 into t2
3. drive back to l2_1
4. unload p1
5. load into a2
6. fly a2 to l1_1
7. unload p1 (done)

For p2:

8. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1 (empty)
9. drive t2 to l2_2, load p2
10. drive to l2_3, unload (constraint 1 and 3)
11. load again, drive to l2_4, unload (constraint 5)
12. load again, drive to l2_1, unload
13. load into a1
14. fly a1 to l1_1
15. unload p2
16. drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1
17. load p2 into t1
18. drive to l1_4
19. unload p2

This plan includes flying a1 to l2_1 and back. Now, checking constraints:

- Constraint 1: p2 is in l2_3 (step 10 after unload). So that's covered.
- Constraint 2: p2 is in l2_1 (step 12 unload, step 13 load)
- Constraint 3: when p2 is in l2_1 (after step 12), the earlier state where p2 was in l2_3 (step 10) exists. So yes.
- Constraint 5: p2 is in l2_4 (step 11 after unload). So when p2 is in l1_4 (step 19), there was an earlier state (step 11) where p2 was in l2_4. So that's covered.

This seems to satisfy all constraints. Now, the steps count is 19. But maybe there's a shorter way.

Wait, perhaps combining steps. For example, after step 12 (p2 is in l2_1), we load into a1 (which is already in l2_1 after step 8). So steps 8 (fly a1 to l2_1) is needed before step 13. So steps 8 and 13.

But this seems necessary.

Now, let's check if the constraints are all met.

The first constraint is that in at least one state, p1 is in l1_2 or p2 is in l2_3. In this plan, p2 is in l2_3 (step 10 unload), so that's covered.

The second constraint is that p2 is in l2_1 (step 12 unload and step 13 load). Covered.

Third constraint: when p2 is in l2_1 (step 12), earlier state where p2 was in l2_3 (step 10). Covered.

Fourth: p2 is in l1_4 (step 19). Covered.

Fifth: when p2 is in l1_4 (step 19), earlier state (step 11) where p2 was in l2_4. Covered.

So all constraints are satisfied.

Now, the plan steps:

For p1:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
3. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
5. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
6. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
7. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

For p2:

8. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
9. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
10. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
11. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
12. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
13. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
14. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
15. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
16. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
17. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
18. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
19. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
20. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
21. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
22. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
23. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
24. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
25. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

But wait, step 8 is flying a1 to l2_1. Then step 19 loads p2 into a1, which is at l2_1. Then fly back to l1_1.

So that's correct.

But this plan has 25 steps. That's a lot. Is there a way to make it shorter?

Wait, perhaps we can optimize by reordering steps. For example, after step 7 (p1 is in l1_1), can we use a1 (which is in l1_1) to transport p2 without flying it to l2_1 first? No, because p2 is in l2_1. Unless we first fly a1 to l2_1, but that's what step 8 does.

Alternatively, maybe use a2 for both packages. After transporting p1 to l1_1, fly a2 back to l2_1 to get p2. But this would require:

After step 6 (fly a2 to l1_1):

- step 7: unload p1.

Then:

- fly a2 back to l2_1 (step 8: flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1)

Then load p2 into a2, fly back to l1_1.

This would save steps compared to using a1. Because using a1 requires flying it to l2_1 and back, but using a2 for both requires flying a2 back and forth.

Let's try this approach:

For p1:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
3. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
5. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
6. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
7. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

For p2:

8. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1 (now a2 is back in l2_1)
9. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
10. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
11. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
12. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
13. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
14. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
15. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
16. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
17. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
18. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
19. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
20. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
21. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
22. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
23. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
24. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
25. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

This way, we use a2 for both packages, which reduces the need to use a1. But steps 8 and 20 are the fly actions for a2. This plan is still 25 steps. But maybe there's a way to optimize further.

Wait, perhaps after moving p1 to l1_1, we can immediately fly a2 back to l2_1 (step 8) while the truck is moving p2. But this depends on the order of steps.

Alternatively, maybe the steps for p2 can be done while a2 is moving back. But the actions need to be sequential.

Alternatively, maybe combine the steps where possible. For example, after step 7 (p1 is unloaded), fly a2 back to l2_1 (step 8). Then while a2 is there, proceed with p2's steps.

But I'm not sure if that reduces the number of steps. Each action is a separate step.

Alternatively, perhaps we can interleave some steps. For example, after p1 is loaded into a2 (step 5), while it's being flown to l1_1, start moving p2. But actions are sequential, so you can't do two at the same time.

Another optimization: when moving p2 from l2_2 to l2_3 to l2_4 to l2_1, maybe drive directly from l2_2 to l2_4, but that would skip l2_3. But then p2 wouldn't be in l2_3, which is needed for constraint 1 and 3. So no.

Hmm. It seems that the minimal plan must include the necessary steps to meet all constraints, even if it's longer. Let's try to outline the final plan step by step, ensuring all constraints are met and the steps are optimal.

Final Plan Steps:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2 (move t2 to p1's location)
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (load p1 into t2)
3. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 (return to airport)
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (p1 now at l2_1)
5. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (load p1 into a2)
6. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (fly to c1's airport)
7. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (p1 at goal)
8. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1 (return a2 to l2_1 for p2)
9. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2 (move t2 to p2's location)
10. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (load p2)
11. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2 (move to l2_3)
12. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (p2 here, satisfies constraint 1 & 3)
13. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (reload)
14. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2 (move to l2_4)
15. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (p2 here, satisfies constraint 5)
16. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (reload)
17. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2 (return to airport)
18. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (p2 here, satisfies constraint 2)
19. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (load onto a2)
20. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (fly to c1's airport)
21. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (p2 at l1_1)
22. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 (move t1 to airport)
23. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (load p2 into t1)
24. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1 (drive to goal)
25. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (p2 at goal)

This plan has 25 steps. But is there a way to shorten it?

Wait, after step 17, t2 is at l2_1 with p2 loaded. Then step 18 is unloading, which is necessary to load onto the airplane. So steps 17-19 are necessary.

Another observation: When transporting p2 from l2_4 to l2_1, maybe we can unload directly at l2_1 without stopping, but the steps are already optimized.

Alternatively, can we avoid unloading p2 at l2_3 and l2_4 and instead use a different approach? For example, after loading p2 into t2 at l2_2, drive to l2_3, then drive to l2_4, then drive to l2_1, and only unload at l2_1. But then p2 would not be in l2_3 or l2_4, so constraints 1 and 5 wouldn't be met. So no.

Thus, this seems to be the minimal plan that satisfies all constraints. Let's check again the constraints:

- Constraint 1: p2 is in l2_3 (step 12) or p1 in l1_2. p1 is in l1_1, so p2 in l2_3 covers it.
- Constraint 2: p2 in l2_1 (step 18).
- Constraint 3: when p2 is in l2_1 (step 18), earlier state step 12 (p2 in l2_3) exists.
- Constraint 4: p2 in l1_4 (step 25).
- Constraint 5: when p2 is in l1_4, earlier state step 15 (p2 in l2_4) exists.

All constraints are satisfied.

Is there a way to reduce the number of steps? For example, combining steps where possible.

Wait, step 8 is fly a2 back to l2_1. Then step 19 is load p2 into a2. But steps 9-18 are moving p2 to l2_1. So the sequence is necessary.

Alternatively, if we can load p2 into a different airplane without returning a2. But a1 is in l1_1 initially. To use a1 for p2, we need to fly it to l2_1, which takes steps. Which might not save steps.

Alternatively, use a1 for p1 and a2 for p2. Let's see:

For p1:

1. Use a1 to fly from l1_1 to l2_1 (empty)
2. load p1 into a1 (but p1 is in l2_5, so need to move it to l2_1 first with truck)
   - drive t2 to l2_5, load, drive back, unload.
3. fly a1 back to l1_1 with p1.

For p2:

4. Use a2 to fly from l2_1 to l1_1 with p2.

But this would require:

For p1:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
3. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
6. loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
7. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
8. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

For p2:

9. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
10. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
11. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
12. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
13. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
14. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
15. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
16. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
17. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
18. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
19. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
20. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
21. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
22. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
23. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
24. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
25. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

This approach also has 25 steps. So no improvement.

Therefore, the initial plan with 25 steps seems to be the minimal required to satisfy all constraints. However, the user requested an optimal plan with minimal length. Let's re-examine to see if any steps can be merged or skipped.

Wait, perhaps after step 15 (unload p2 at l2_4), instead of reloading and driving to l2_1, can we fly from l2_4? But l2_4 is not an airport. Airplanes can only fly between airports (l1_1 and l2_1). So no. So p2 must be transported back to l2_1 airport via truck.

Another idea: Can we fly a1 to l2_1 earlier to transport p2, while also using a2 for p1?

Wait, a1 is in l1_1. If we fly a1 to l2_1 early, maybe while p1 is being moved, then use it for p2. Let's try:

For p1:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
3. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
5. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
6. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
7. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

For p2:

8. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (a1 now in l2_1)
9. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
10. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
11. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
12. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
13. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
14. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
15. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
16. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
17. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
18. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
19. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
20. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
21. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
22. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
23. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
24. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
25. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

This is still 25 steps. No improvement.

Another thought: After step 18 (p2 in l2_1), load into a1 (already there from step 8), fly to l1_1. Then use t1 to move p2 to l1_4.

So steps are the same. No reduction.

Thus, it seems that the plan must be 25 steps. However, perhaps there's a smarter way to sequence the steps to avoid some redundancies.

Wait, when moving p2 from l2_2 to l2_3 to l2_4 to l2_1, each time we unload and reload. But perhaps instead of unloading and reloading, we can keep p2 in the truck and just drive through the locations. But then, the package would be in the truck, not the location. So the constraints require that p2 is in l2_3 and l2_4, which means it must be unloaded there.

Thus, those steps are necessary.

Another idea: After step 12 (p2 unloaded at l2_3), instead of reloading and driving to l2_4, can we drive to l2_4 without unloading? No, because then p2 would not be in l2_3. The constraint requires that in at least one state, p2 is in l2_3. So we must unload it there.

Similarly, for l2_4.

Therefore, these steps are required.

Given all this, the plan must include these steps to meet the constraints, even if it's lengthy. However, the user insists on an optimal plan with minimal steps. Maybe there's a way to find a shorter plan by reordering steps or using different actions.

Wait, the constraints require that certain states are visited, but they don't require that certain actions are taken. So perhaps there's a way to fulfill the constraints without as many steps.

For example, constraint 1 requires that at least one of p1 in l1_2 or p2 in l2_3. If we can have p1 in l1_2, then we don't need p2 in l2_3. But p1's goal is in l1_1, so why would we move it to l1_2? That's out of the way. Unless it's necessary for a constraint.

But perhaps if we move p1 through l1_2, which is in c1. But p1 starts in c2. So to get p1 to l1_2, we need to transport it to c1's airport (l1_1), then use truck t1 to move it to l1_2. But that's extra steps. However, this would allow us to satisfy constraint 1 and possibly avoid some steps for p2.

Let's explore this alternative.

Plan alternative:

For p1:

1. Use a2 to fly to l1_1 as before.
2. Then, load into t1, drive to l1_2 (unload, so p1 is in l1_2), then drive back to l1_1 and unload again.

But this adds steps for p1, but maybe allows us to avoid steps for p2.

But let's see:

If p1 is in l1_2 at some point, then constraint 1 is satisfied (since p1 is in l1_2). So we don't need to have p2 in l2_3.

So for p2, we could avoid the detour through l2_3 and l2_4, but we need to check other constraints.

But let's see:

If p1 is moved to l1_2:

For p1:

Steps:

1. Drive t2 to l2_5, load, drive back to l2_1, unload.
2. load into a2, fly to l1_1, unload.
3. drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1, load p1, drive to l1_2, unload. Now p1 is in l1_2 (satisfies constraint 1)
4. Then drive t1 back to l1_1, load p1, drive to l1_1, unload. (But this is redundant. Alternatively, leave p1 in l1_2 and then move it back to l1_1, but that adds steps.)

But this would add steps for p1 but allow p2 to take a shorter path.

For p2:

Could then be transported directly from l2_2 to l2_1 via truck, but need to check constraints:

- Constraint 3: when p2 is in l2_1, must have earlier state where p2 is in l2_3 or p1 in l1_3. If p1 is in l1_2, which is not l1_3, so this doesn't help. So p2 still needs to go through l2_3.

Alternatively, have p1 in l1_3 at some point. But that would require moving it from l1_1 to l1_3 via truck.

But this seems even more steps.

Thus, this alternative approach may not save steps overall.

Another idea: Perhaps satisfy constraint 5 by having p1 in l1_3 during its transport. For example, after flying p1 to l1_1, load it into t1 and drive to l1_3, unload, then drive back to l1_1.

This would add steps but allow p2 to avoid going through l2_4.

But let's see:

For p1:

1. ... (same steps to get to l1_1)
2. drive t1 to l1_1, load p1, drive to l1_3, unload (p1 in l1_3)
3. load again, drive to l1_1, unload.

This adds steps for p1, but then for p2, when it's in l1_4 (goal), there's an earlier state where p1 was in l1_3, satisfying constraint 5. So p2 doesn't need to go through l2_4.

This might save steps overall:

For p2:

1. Drive t2 to l2_2, load p2.
2. Drive to l2_3, unload (satisfies constraint 1 and 3)
3. Load again, drive to l2_1, unload.
4. Fly to l1_1.
5. Drive t1 to l1_1, load p2, drive to l1_4, unload.

But this would require:

For p2:

- Steps to move to l2_3, unload (satisfies constraint 1 and 3)
- Then move to l2_1, fly to l1_1, truck to l1_4.

But constraint 5 requires that when p2 is in l1_4, there's an earlier state where p1 is in l1_3 or p2 in l2_4. If p1 was in l1_3 earlier, then this is satisfied. So by adding steps for p1 to visit l1_3, p2 can avoid visiting l2_4.

Let's calculate the steps:

For p1:

1. Drive t2 to l2_5, load, drive back to l2_1, unload. (4 steps)
2. Load into a2, fly to l1_1, unload. (3 steps)
3. Drive t1 to l1_1, load p1, drive to l1_3, unload. (3 steps) → p1 in l1_3
4. Drive t1 to l1_3, load p1, drive to l1_1, unload. (3 steps)

But steps 3 and 4 are optional. However, we only need p1 to be in l1_3 at some point. So after step 3, p1 is in l1_3. Then we need to get it back to l1_1 for the goal. So:

For p1:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
3. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
5. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
6. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
7. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
8. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
9. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
10. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
11. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
12. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
13. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

This adds 7 steps for p1 (steps 8-13), which is more than before. But for p2, the steps could be reduced.

For p2:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (constraint 1 & 3)
5. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
6. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
7. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (constraint 2)
8. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
9. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
10. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
11. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1 (but t1 is in l1_1 after step 12)
12. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
13. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
14. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

But wait, after step 13 for p1, t1 is in l1_1 again. So steps for p2 after that:

But this approach leads to more total steps than the previous plan.

Overall, the total steps would be higher (steps for p1: 13, p2: 14), totaling 27 steps. Worse than the previous 25 steps.

Therefore, the initial plan with 25 steps seems better.

Given all this, the minimal plan satisfying all constraints is the one with 25 steps as outlined. However, I need to check again for possible optimizations.

Wait, in the initial plan, steps 8-18 for p2 involve moving t2 to l2_2, then to l2_3, unload, load, drive to l2_4, unload, load, drive to l2_1, unload. Perhaps there's a way to avoid some loads/unloads.

Wait, when you unload p2 at l2_3 (step 12), then immediately load it again (step 13). This is necessary to move it to l2_4. Similarly for l2_4. But this is required to have p2 in those locations. So these steps are necessary.

Another observation: After step 7, p1 is already at its goal (l1_1). The rest of the plan deals with p2. So the steps after 7 are all for p2.

Is there a way to combine any of these steps? For example, after step 18 (p2 unloaded at l2_1), can we load onto a2 and fly in one step? But loading and flying are separate actions.

No, each action must be a separate step.

Given this, the plan is as minimal as possible. Therefore, the final answer is the 25-step plan outlined earlier.
