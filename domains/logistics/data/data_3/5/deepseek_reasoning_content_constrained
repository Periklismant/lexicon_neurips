Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. So, the goal is to get package p1 to l1_4 and p2 to l1_3, right? But there are several constraints we need to satisfy. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, let's look at the initial state. p1 is in l1_5 (city c1), and p2 is in l1_4 (also c1). The trucks are t1 in l1_4 and t2 in l2_3 (city c2). The airplanes are a1 in l1_1 (airport in c1) and a2 in l2_1 (airport in c2).

The constraints are a bit tricky. Let's list them out:

1. At some point, p2 must be in l1_3. But before that, p2 must have been in l1_5. Wait, but p2 starts in l1_4. So we need to move p2 to l1_5 first, then to l1_3? That's one constraint. Hmm, that seems odd because moving from l1_4 to l1_5 might not be necessary unless required by the constraints. But according to the second constraint, whenever p2 is in l1_3 in some state, there must have been an earlier state where p2 was in l1_5. So we need to get p2 to l1_5 first, then to l1_3.

2. Also, p2 must be in l1_4 at some point. Well, initially, p2 is already in l1_4, so that's satisfied. But maybe if during the plan p2 is moved away and then back, but the initial state already has it there. Wait, the problem says "must hold in at least one state"â€”so since the initial state has p2 in l1_4, that's already covered. But we need to check if any subsequent action might remove it from there. However, the constraints must be true in at least one state. So as long as in some state (including the initial) p2 is in l1_4, that's okay. But if during the plan, we move p2 from l1_4 to somewhere else, but then maybe bring it back. Wait, but the initial state counts, so maybe that constraint is already satisfied. But I need to confirm. The problem says the constraints must be true in at least one state. So the initial state is part of the states. So "p2 is in l1_4" is already true initially. So that constraint is satisfied. But the fourth constraint says that if p2 is in l1_4 in some state s, then p1 must be in l2_3 in s or a subsequent state. Wait, but initially, p2 is in l1_4. So according to this constraint, we must have p1 in l2_3 at some point from the initial state onwards. Because the initial state has p2 in l1_4, so in state s (initial), the implication is that p1 must be in l2_3 in s or after. So we need to make sure that p1 is moved to l2_3 at some point. But the final goal is p1 in l1_4. So how does that work? We need to move p1 from l1_5 to l1_4, but also at some point have p1 in l2_3. Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, the final goal is p1 in l1_4 and p2 in l1_3. But the constraint says that if p2 is in l1_4 (which it is initially), then p1 must be in l2_3 in that state or a later one. So since the initial state has p2 in l1_4, then in the initial state, we need p1 to be in l2_3 (which it's not) or in some state after. So p1 has to be moved to l2_3 at some point after the initial state. But how? Because l2_3 is in city c2. So p1 starts in c1, needs to get to l1_4 (c1), but also must be in l2_3 (c2) at some point. That implies that p1 has to be transported to c2. So perhaps using an airplane. Let's think.

Another constraint is that at some state, either p2 is in t2 or p1 is in t2. Since t2 is a truck in l2_3 (city c2), how can p1 or p2 get there? p1 is in c1, p2 is in c1. So we need to move either p1 or p2 to c2 and load into t2. But that seems complicated.

Let me outline the steps needed for the goals first:

Goal: p1 in l1_4 (c1) and p2 in l1_3 (c1).

So for p1: it's in l1_5 initially. To get to l1_4, perhaps use truck t1, which is already in l1_4. Wait, t1 is in l1_4. Wait, but in the original state, "Package t1 is in location l1_4". Wait, wait, the original state says "Package t1 is in location l1_4" but t1 is a truck. Wait, that must be a typo. Let me check the original state again.

Looking back: The original state includes:

"Package t1 is in location l1_4"

"Package t2 is in location l2_3"

Wait, that's a mistake. Because t1 and t2 are trucks, not packages. The packages are p1 and p2. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement. Let me check again.

The user wrote:

"The original state of the world is the following:

...

"Package t1 is in location l1_4"

"Package t2 is in location l2_3"

"Package p1 is in location l1_5"

"Package p2 is in location l1_4"

"Package a1 is in location l1_1"

"Package a2 is in location l2_1""

Wait, that's confusing. Because t1 and t2 are trucks, a1 and a2 are airplanes, but the problem lists them as "Package t1", etc. That's probably a mistake. Maybe they meant "Truck t1 is in location l1_4", and "Airplane a1 is in l1_1", etc. Otherwise, the problem doesn't make sense, because you can't load a truck into a truck. Let me assume that's a typo. So the correct initial state should be:

Truck t1 is in l1_4

Truck t2 is in l2_3

Airplane a1 is in l1_1

Airplane a2 is in l2_1

Packages p1 in l1_5, p2 in l1_4.

That makes more sense. Because otherwise, the problem is impossible. So I'll proceed under that assumption.

So, initial positions:

Trucks:

t1 in l1_4 (c1)

t2 in l2_3 (c2)

Airplanes:

a1 in l1_1 (c1 airport)

a2 in l2_1 (c2 airport)

Packages:

p1 in l1_5 (c1)

p2 in l1_4 (c1)

Now, the goal is p1 in l1_4 (c1) and p2 in l1_3 (c1).

Constraints:

1. p2 must be in l1_3 at least once (which is the goal, so that's covered)

But also, if p2 is in l1_3 in some state, there must have been an earlier state where p2 was in l1_5. So we need to move p2 from l1_4 to l1_5 first, then to l1_3.

But p2 starts in l1_4. So how do we get it to l1_5? We can use a truck. Since t1 is in l1_4, we can load p2 into t1, drive to l1_5, unload, then drive to l1_3.

Wait, but cities have locations connected by trucks. So for c1, locations are l1_1 (airport), l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5. The truck t1 is in l1_4. So to move p2 from l1_4 to l1_5: load p2 into t1 (since both are in l1_4), then drive t1 to l1_5. Then unload p2 in l1_5. Then, drive t1 to l1_3 and unload p2 there. But that would get p2 to l1_3, but according to the constraint, we need to have p2 in l1_5 before that. So that's covered.

But also, the fourth constraint: if p2 is in l1_4 in any state s, then p1 must be in l2_3 in s or later. Since p2 starts in l1_4, the initial state is s0. So we need p1 to be in l2_3 at s0 or after. But p1 starts in l1_5 (c1), so we need to move it to l2_3 (c2). How?

To get p1 from c1 to c2, we can use an airplane. So load p1 into a truck, drive to the airport (l1_1), load into airplane a1, fly to l2_1 (c2's airport), unload, load into t2 (since t2 is in l2_3, but l2_1 is an airport in c2. Wait, cities: c2 has locations l2_1 (airport), l2_2, l2_3, etc. Trucks can move within the city. So to get p1 to l2_3 in c2, we need to:

1. Move p1 from l1_5 (c1) to l1_1 (airport) via truck.

   - Load p1 into a truck. But in c1, the available truck is t1, which is in l1_4. So first, maybe drive t1 to l1_5.

Wait, initial positions: t1 is in l1_4. So to get t1 to l1_5: drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1. Then load p1 into t1 at l1_5. Then drive t1 to l1_1 (airport). Then unload p1 into airplane a1. Fly a1 to l2_1 (c2's airport). Then in c2, use truck t2 (which is in l2_3). Wait, but l2_1 is the airport in c2. So how to get to l2_3? Since in c2, locations are l2_1 (airport), l2_2, l2_3, etc. So t2 is in l2_3. To move from l2_1 to l2_3, t2 would need to drive. But t2 is in l2_3. So to move t2 to l2_1, drive from l2_3 to l2_1. Wait, but can a truck move between any two locations in the city? The drivetruck action allows moving between any two locations in the same city. So yes. So steps for c2:

After flying a1 to l2_1 (with p1), unload p1 from a1. Then load p1 into truck t2 (which is in l2_3? Wait, t2 is in l2_3, but we need to get t2 to l2_1. So drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1. Then load p1 into t2 at l2_1, then drive back to l2_3 and unload. That way, p1 is in l2_3.

But this seems complicated, but necessary to meet the constraint that when p2 was in l1_4 (initially), then p1 must be in l2_3 at some point after.

So the plan would involve moving p1 to l2_3, then back to c1 to l1_4.

But wait, the goal is p1 in l1_4. So after moving p1 to l2_3, we need to bring it back. That's a lot of steps.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to satisfy the constraints without moving p1 all the way to l2_3. Let me check the constraints again.

Constraint 4: If p2 is in l1_4 in some state s, then p1 must be in l2_3 in s or after. Since p2 is in l1_4 in the initial state, then p1 must be in l2_3 at some point during or after the initial state. So even if p2 is moved out of l1_4 later, as long as in the initial state (s0) p2 is in l1_4, then the constraint requires that p1 is in l2_3 at s0 or later. But in s0, p1 is in l1_5, so we have to move p1 to l2_3.

So regardless of what happens later, we have to have p1 in l2_3 at some point.

So steps for p1:

From l1_5 (c1) to l1_1 (c1 airport) via truck t1.

Load into airplane a1, fly to l2_1 (c2 airport).

Unload, load into truck t2 (which needs to be driven to l2_1), drive t2 to l2_3, unload p1 there.

Then, to get p1 back to c1 for the goal, we need to:

Load p1 into truck t2 again, drive to l2_1 airport, load into airplane a2 (which is in l2_1), fly to l1_1 (c1 airport), unload, load into truck t1 (driven to l1_1), drive to l1_4, unload.

But this seems very long. But maybe necessary.

But let's also consider the other constraints. The fifth constraint requires that at some state, either p2 is in t2 or p1 is in t2. Since t2 is in c2, and p1 has to be in t2 at some point, this can happen when p1 is loaded into t2 in c2.

So, putting it all together:

Plan Steps:

1. Move p2 from l1_4 to l1_5, then to l1_3.

But first, need to handle the p1 movement to l2_3.

Wait, but the order matters. Since the constraint for p2 being in l1_3 requires that it was in l1_5 before. So we have to first move p2 to l1_5, then to l1_3.

But also, to satisfy the constraint that when p2 is in l1_4 (initially), p1 must be in l2_3 later. So the movement of p1 to l2_3 must occur after the initial state.

So perhaps the steps are:

For p1:

a. Load p1 into a truck in l1_5.

But initially, the truck t1 is in l1_4. So first, drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_5.

1. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1

2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5

3. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1 (to the airport)

4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

5. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

6. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

7. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

Now, in l2_1 (c2's airport), need to get p1 into t2. But t2 is in l2_3. So drive t2 to l2_1:

8. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

9. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

10. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2

11. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

Now p1 is in l2_3. This satisfies the fourth constraint (since after initial state, p1 reaches l2_3).

Now, to get p1 back to c1:

12. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

13. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

14. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

15. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

16. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

17. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

Then, load into t1 (which is in l1_1? No, after step 3, t1 was driven to l1_1 (step 3: drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1). So t1 is in l1_1 now.

Wait, after step 3: t1 is in l1_1. Then step 4 unloads p1 in l1_1, then step 5 loads into a1. So t1 is still in l1_1. So after step 17, p1 is in l1_1. So steps to get p1 to l1_4:

18. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

19. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

20. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

This gets p1 to the goal.

For p2:

Initially in l1_4. Need to get to l1_3, but with the constraint that before reaching l1_3, it must be in l1_5.

But since p2 starts in l1_4, we need to move it to l1_5 first.

But how? Since t1 is in l1_4 initially. Wait, in the initial state, t1 is in l1_4. So steps for p2:

But during the p1 steps, t1 is moved to l1_5 (step 1), then to l1_1 (step 3). So after step 3, t1 is in l1_1, and p2 is still in l1_4. To move p2, we need another truck. But in c1, there's only t1. Wait, the problem says trucks t1 and t2. t1 is in c1, t2 in c2. So in c1, only t1 is available.

So to move p2, we have to use t1. But t1 is being used for p1's transport. So perhaps the steps for p2 are interleaved.

Wait, after step 1: t1 is in l1_5. Then, we loaded p1 into t1 (step 2), drove to l1_1 (step3), unloaded p1 (step4), etc. So after step3, t1 is in l1_1. So after that, can we use t1 again to move p2?

But p2 is in l1_4. To move p2, we need a truck in l1_4. But after step1, t1 was moved to l1_5, then to l1_1. So after step3, t1 is in l1_1. So unless we drive t1 back to l1_4, we can't move p2.

Wait, but after step3, t1 is in l1_1. Let's see. Suppose after step17, when p1 is back in l1_1, we can use t1 to move p2.

But wait, p2 is in l1_4. So to move p2, we need t1 to be in l1_4 again. So after step19, t1 is driven to l1_4 (step19 is drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1). So after step19, t1 is in l1_4. Then, in step20, unload p1 there.

So after step20, p1 is in l1_4 (goal achieved). Now, t1 is in l1_4. Then, to move p2 from l1_4 to l1_5 and then to l1_3:

21. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

22. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1

23. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

24. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1

25. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

This would get p2 to l1_3, satisfying the goal and the constraints that p2 was in l1_5 before.

But let's check the constraints again:

- p2 must be in l1_3 (goal met).

- Before p2 is in l1_3, it was in l1_5 (step23).

- p2 must be in l1_4 at some point (initial state, so yes).

- When p2 was in l1_4 (initially), then p1 must be in l2_3 at some point after. Which is step11.

- At least one state where p2 is in t2 or p1 is in t2. In step9, p1 is loaded into t2. So step9 satisfies this.

So this seems to cover all constraints.

But let's check the order of steps. Also, we need to make sure that the plan is optimal, i.e., as short as possible.

But the plan I outlined has 25 steps. Maybe there's a shorter way.

Alternative approach:

Let's see if we can combine some steps.

For example, moving p1 to l2_3 and back. Is there a way to avoid moving it all the way there?

But the constraint requires that p1 must be in l2_3 after the initial state. So we can't avoid that.

Another idea: Maybe use the airplane a2 to carry p1 back. But perhaps there's a way to minimize steps.

Wait, after p1 is in l2_3 (step11), to get it back to c1, we can load into t2 (step12), drive to l2_1 (step13), unload (step14), load into a2 (step15), fly to l1_1 (step16), unload (step17), then load into t1 (step18), drive to l1_4 (step19), unload (step20). That's 9 steps for the return trip. Maybe there's a way to optimize.

Alternatively, after step11 (p1 in l2_3), can we fly directly from l2_3? No, airplanes can only fly between airports. So l2_3 is not an airport. So need to go via l2_1.

Also, for the p2 movement, after p1 is in l1_4 (step20), we can then handle p2. But perhaps we can interleave some steps.

Wait, after step20, t1 is in l1_4. So steps 21-25 for p2. That's 5 more steps. Total steps: 25.

But maybe we can do better.

Wait, during the steps where t1 is in l1_1 (after step3), maybe we can use it to move p2 earlier.

But p2 is in l1_4. So to move p2, we need t1 to be in l1_4. After step3, t1 is in l1_1. So unless we drive t1 back to l1_4 earlier.

Alternatively, after step3, can we drive t1 back to l1_4 to move p2 before handling p1's flight?

But then p1 is in l1_1, unloaded. So maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the order of moving p1 and p2 can be adjusted.

Wait, but the constraint for p2 being in l1_3 requires that it was in l1_5 before. So moving p2 to l1_5 and then to l1_3 is necessary. But if we can interleave these steps with moving p1.

But given the dependencies, it's challenging.

Alternatively, after step3, t1 is in l1_1. To move p2 from l1_4, we need to get t1 back to l1_4. But that would add steps.

Alternatively, perhaps use airplane a1 to carry p2? But p2 is in c1. To move p2 within c1, using a truck is more efficient.

Hmm.

Alternatively, can we move p2 first, before moving p1?

But the fourth constraint requires that when p2 is in l1_4 (initially), p1 must be in l2_3 later. So even if we move p2 first, we still have to move p1 to l2_3.

So regardless of the order, p1 must go to l2_3.

But moving p2 first might require using the truck t1, which is needed for p1's movement.

Wait, if we first move p2:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1

3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

4. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1

5. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (now p2 is in goal)

But then, after that, we need to move p1 to l2_3. But t1 is in l1_3 now. To move p1 from l1_5, we need to drive t1 back to l1_5.

6. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_5 c1

7. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5

8. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1

9. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

10. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

11. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

12. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

Then, move p1 to l2_3:

13. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

14. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

15. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2

16. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (now p1 is in l2_3)

Then bring it back:

17. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

18. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

19. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

20. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

21. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

22. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

23. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (t1 is in l1_1 after step8)

24. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

25. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

This also takes 25 steps. Same length.

But in this approach, the fifth constraint (p1 in t2) is satisfied in step14.

But in this plan, p2 is moved first. But does this meet all constraints?

The fourth constraint is satisfied because p1 reaches l2_3 in step16.

But the initial state has p2 in l1_4, so the fourth constraint is triggered, requiring p1 to be in l2_3 later. Which happens in step16.

The fifth constraint is met in step14 where p1 is in t2.

So both approaches have the same number of steps.

Is there a way to shorten this?

Let me think.

When moving p1 back from l2_3 to c1, after step16 (p1 in l2_3), can we fly directly from l2_3? No, because airplanes can only fly between airports, which are l2_1 and l1_1. So we have to move p1 from l2_3 to l2_1 via truck t2.

Similarly, when moving p1 from c1 to c2, we have to use the airport.

Alternatively, can we use the same airplane for both directions?

Yes, but airplanes can fly between any two airports. So a1 is in l1_1 initially. After flying to l2_1, it's there. But to fly back, we can use a1 again, but we need to load p1 into it in l2_1.

Wait, after step11, a1 is in l2_1. So in step21, if we use a1 to fly back, but step16 uses a2. Hmm.

Alternatively, use a1 to fly back. Let's see:

After step11, p1 is in l2_1 (unloaded from a1). Then, after moving to l2_3 and back to l2_1, load into a1 and fly back.

But that would require a1 to be in l2_1. Which it is after step11.

So steps after step16:

17. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

18. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

19. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

20. loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

21. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1

22. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

Then, load into t1 and drive to l1_4.

This saves steps because we use a1 instead of a2, but a1 is already in l2_1. So steps 20-22 replace steps15-17 in the previous plan. So perhaps this saves a few steps.

But let's count:

Original steps for return trip using a2:

15. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

16. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

17. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

Using a1 instead:

20. loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

21. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1

22. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

Same number of steps. No savings.

Another idea: When bringing p1 back to c1, can we load it into the same truck that's already in l1_1? But t1 is in l1_1 after step8.

Wait, in the first approach, after step3, t1 is in l1_1. Then after step17 (returning p1 to l1_1), we load into t1 (step18) and drive to l1_4 (step19). So that's necessary.

Alternatively, can we have t1 waiting in l1_1, so when p1 arrives, it's already there.

No, because t1 is needed to move p2.

Wait, perhaps there's a way to parallelize actions. But since the problem requires a sequence, not parallel, so each action is sequential.

Another angle: The fifth constraint requires that in some state, either p2 is in t2 or p1 is in t2. Loading p1 into t2 in step9 (first approach) satisfies this. So that's covered.

Now, to check for optimality. Maybe there's a way to reduce steps.

Wait, in the first approach, when moving p1 to l2_3, after step7 (unload in l2_1), we load into t2 which is driven from l2_3 to l2_1. But what if t2 is already in l2_1?

Wait, initial state: t2 is in l2_3. So we have to drive it to l2_1 to load p1. So steps8-10:

8. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

9. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

10. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2

11. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

But what if after step10, we leave t2 in l2_3 and then use it again to drive back. But when returning p1, we need to drive t2 again from l2_3 to l2_1. Which would add steps. So it's necessary to have those steps.

Alternatively, after step8, t2 is in l2_1. We can load p1 and keep it there, but then to unload in l2_3, we have to drive back.

No, because the goal for the constraint is to have p1 in l2_3. So we have to drive to l2_3 and unload.

So no way to avoid those steps.

Another observation: The fifth constraint only requires that in at least one state, either p2 is in t2 or p1 is in t2. Since p2 is in c1 and t2 is in c2, p2 can't be in t2. So p1 must be in t2 at some point. Which happens when p1 is loaded into t2 (step9 in first approach). So that's covered.

Now, let's see if there's a way to shorten the plan.

Wait, after step11, p1 is in l2_3. Then, to bring it back, we have to load into t2 again (step12), drive to l2_1 (step13), unload (step14), load into airplane (step15), fly (step16), unload (step17), load into t1 (step18), drive to l1_4 (step19), unload (step20). That's 9 steps. But maybe we can avoid some steps.

Wait, after step11, p1 is in l2_3. If we can fly from l2_3, but no, it's not an airport. So we must move to l2_1. So steps12-14 are necessary.

Alternatively, when p1 is in l2_3, can we use another truck? But t2 is the only truck in c2.

So no. So steps are necessary.

Similarly, after step17, p1 is in l1_1. To get to l1_4, must use t1. So steps18-20 are necessary.

Thus, the total number of steps seems to be fixed.

Now, checking for the minimal possible steps. The plan I outlined has 25 steps, but perhaps there's a shorter path.

Wait, perhaps the movement of p2 can be done while p1 is being transported.

For example, after step20 (p1 in l1_4), steps21-25 move p2. But maybe during the time when p1 is being moved to l2_3 and back, we can move p2.

But since p2 is in c1 and requires truck t1, which is being used to move p1, it's not possible to interleave the steps.

Wait, when t1 is in l1_1 (after step3), maybe we can drive it back to l1_4 to move p2.

But let's see:

Original steps for p1:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1

2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5

3. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1

At this point, t1 is in l1_1. If we then drive t1 back to l1_4:

4. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

Then, load p2 into t1:

5. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

6. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1

7. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

8. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1

9. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

But then, t1 is in l1_3. But we need to get p1 from l1_1 to the airport. So after step3, t1 is in l1_1. If we drive it back to l1_4 (step4), then we can move p2, but then how to get p1 to the airport?

After step3, p1 is loaded into t1 in l1_5, then driven to l1_1 and unloaded (step4). So p1 is in l1_1, and t1 is in l1_1. If we then drive t1 back to l1_4 (step4), unload p1 is already in l1_1. So p1 is not in t1 anymore. So to move p1 to the airport, we need to load it into t1 again.

But after step4 (drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1), p1 is in l1_1. So to load p1 into t1, we need t1 to be in l1_1. But t1 is in l1_4 after step4. So this approach doesn't work.

Thus, the steps must be done in sequence. Therefore, the plan length cannot be reduced further.

Given that, the initial plan with 25 steps is optimal. But wait, 25 steps seems very long. Maybe I made a mistake.

Let me recount the steps in the first approach:

Steps for p1:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1

2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5

3. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1

4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

5. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

6. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

7. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

8. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

9. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

10. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2

11. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

12. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

13. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

14. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

15. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

16. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

17. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

18. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

19. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

20. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

Steps for p2:

21. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

22. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1

23. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

24. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1

25. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

Total steps: 25.

But maybe some steps can be merged.

Wait, step1: t1 moves from l1_4 to l1_5. Then step3: t1 moves from l1_5 to l1_1. So steps1 and3 could be combined if there's a direct path, but since cities allow driving between any two locations, perhaps it's possible to go from l1_4 to l1_1 directly. Wait, no. The drivetruck action allows moving between any two locations in the same city. So instead of driving from l1_4 to l1_5, then to l1_1, could we drive directly from l1_4 to l1_1?

Yes. Because l1_4 and l1_1 are both in c1. So step1 can be replaced with drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1. But wait, initially, p1 is in l1_5. So if we drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1 directly, then we can't load p1, which is in l1_5.

Ah, right. So to load p1, we need t1 to be in l1_5. So steps1 and2 are necessary to load p1 into t1 in l1_5.

Thus, those steps can't be skipped.

Alternative idea: After step3, t1 is in l1_1. Then, when returning p1 to l1_1 (step17), perhaps we can use the same truck for p2. But after step17, t1 is in l1_1, and p2 is still in l1_4.

So to move p2, we need to drive t1 back to l1_4. Which is step19, but that's part of moving p1 to l1_4. So after step19, t1 is in l1_4, and then we can load p2.

Yes, which is what the plan does. Steps21-25 are after step20.

Thus, no way to shorten that.

Alternatively, can we move p2 before moving p1? Let's see:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1

3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

4. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1

5. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (p2 done)

6. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_5 c1

7. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5

8. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1

9. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

10. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

11. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

12. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

13. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

14. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

15. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2

16. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

17. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

18. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

19. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

20. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

21. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

22. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

23. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

24. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

25. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

This also has 25 steps. So same length.

Thus, regardless of the order, the plan requires 25 steps. But is there a shorter way?

Wait, perhaps when moving p1 back from l2_3, instead of driving t2 to l2_1 and flying, can we use airplane a1 which is in l2_1 after step11.

Yes. After step11, a1 is in l2_1. So after step16 (p1 in l2_3), we can drive t2 to l2_1 (steps17-18), load into a1 (step19), fly to l1_1 (step20), unload (step21), then load into t1 and drive.

But this also requires the same number of steps.

Alternatively, after step16, when p1 is in l2_3, if we can load into a different airplane that's already in l2_3. But there's no airplane there.

No, the only airplanes are a1 and a2, which are in l2_1 and l2_1 (a2 is in l2_1 initially, and not moved unless used.

Wait, initial state: a2 is in l2_1. So during the return trip, we can use a2 to fly p1 back. Which is what the original plan does.

But no savings in steps.

Another idea: After step11 (p1 in l2_3), instead of bringing it back, maybe we can leave it there and find another way to satisfy the fourth constraint. But the fourth constraint requires that if p2 is in l1_4 in some state s, then p1 is in l2_3 in s or later. Since p2 is in l1_4 initially (s0), p1 must be in l2_3 at s0 or later. But p1 is not in l2_3 initially, so it must be there later. So we have to move p1 to l2_3, regardless of the goal. But the goal requires p1 to be in l1_4. So we have to move it back. So no way around that.

Thus, the plan seems to be optimal with 25 steps. However, 25 steps seems too long. Let me check if I made a mistake in counting.

Wait, let's list the steps again for the first approach:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1 (t1 to l1_5)

2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5

3. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1 (t1 to l1_1)

4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (p1 in l1_1)

5. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

6. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

7. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 (p1 in l2_1)

8. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2 (t2 to l2_1)

9. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (p1 in t2)

10. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2 (t2 to l2_3)

11. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (p1 in l2_3)

12. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (p1 in t2)

13. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2 (t2 to l2_1)

14. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (p1 in l2_1)

15. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

16. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

17. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (p1 in l1_1)

18. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (t1 is in l1_1)

19. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1 (t1 to l1_4)

20. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4 (p1 done)

21. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (p2 in t1)

22. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1 (t1 to l1_5)

23. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 (p2 in l1_5)

24. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1 (t1 to l1_3)

25. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (p2 done)

Yes, 25 steps. Each step is necessary.

But perhaps there's a shorter way. For example, when moving p1 back to c1, instead of using a2, use a1 again.

After step6, a1 is in l2_1. After step7, p1 is in l2_1. Then, steps8-11 move p1 to l2_3. Then, steps12-14 bring it back to l2_1. Then, load into a1 (which is already in l2_1):

15. loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

16. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1

17. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

This saves two steps compared to using a2, because we don't need to load into a2. But initial plan uses a2. Let's see:

Original steps15-17:

15. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

16. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

17. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

If we use a1 instead:

15. loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

16. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1

17. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

Same number of steps. But this way, we're using a1, which is already in l2_1. So no difference in step count.

Another possible optimization: When returning p1 to c1, can we load it into t1 which is already in l1_1?

After step17, p1 is in l1_1, and t1 is in l1_1 (from step3). So steps18-20 are:

18. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

19. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

20. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

Which is correct.

Now, perhaps after step19, when t1 is in l1_4, we can unload p1 (step20) and immediately load p2 (step21) without moving t1. That's what the plan does.

So no way to save steps there.

Thus, it seems that 25 steps is indeed the minimal plan. But this feels too long. Maybe I missed a more efficient way.

Wait, another angle: The fifth constraint requires that either p2 is in t2 or p1 is in t2. Since p2 is in c1 and t2 is in c2, p2 can't be in t2. So we need to have p1 in t2 at some point. That happens when we load p1 into t2 in step9. So that's covered.

But maybe there's a way to have p1 in t2 without moving it all the way to l2_3. For example, load p1 into t2 in l2_1 and unload immediately. But that would not satisfy the fourth constraint, which requires p1 to be in l2_3.

Because the fourth constraint says that when p2 is in l1_4 (initially), then p1 must be in l2_3 at some point after. So p1 has to be in l2_3, not just in t2 in l2_1.

Thus, no shortcut there.

Another observation: The constraint requires that if p2 is in l1_4 in any state, then p1 must be in l2_3 in that state or later. Since p2 is in l1_4 initially, we have to have p1 in l2_3 at some point. But after that, if p2 is moved to l1_5 and beyond, it doesn't affect the fourth constraint anymore. So once p1 is in l2_3 once, the constraint is satisfied.

Thus, the plan only needs to have p1 in l2_3 once, and after that, it can be moved back.

But according to the plan, p1 is in l2_3 (step11), then moved back. So that's correct.

Another possible mistake: In the original problem statement, the user wrote "Package t1 is in location l1_4", which I assumed was a mistake and should be "Truck t1". If that's not the case, and t1 is a package, then the problem is impossible. But given the context, it's clear that t1 is a truck. So I think the initial assumption is correct.

Given all this, the plan with 25 steps is necessary. But maybe there's a shorter plan that I'm missing.

Wait, another idea: After step11, p1 is in l2_3. The constraint is satisfied. Then, to bring p1 back, perhaps we can use airplane a2 instead of a1. But no, steps would remain the same.

Alternatively, can we avoid moving p1 back and forth by using a different truck or airplane?

No, because the goal requires p1 to be in l1_4.

Another angle: The constraint that p2 must be in l1_4 at least once is already satisfied by the initial state. So no need to move p2 back there. So once p2 is moved from l1_4 to l1_5, the initial state's p2 in l1_4 is sufficient to satisfy the constraint.

Thus, the plan can proceed to move p2 to l1_5 and then to l1_3 without ever returning to l1_4. Which is what the plan does.

So, no steps related to p2 returning to l1_4 are needed.

Thus, the plan is correct.

After careful consideration, I think the plan with 25 steps is the minimal possible. However, I might have made a mistake in assuming that the problem requires p1 to be moved to l2_3. Let me double-check the fourth constraint.

The fourth constraint says: If p2 is in l1_4 in some state s, then p1 must be in l2_3 in s or after. Since p2 is in l1_4 in the initial state, then p1 must be in l2_3 in the initial state or after. But in the initial state, p1 is in l1_5. So p1 must be in l2_3 at some point after the initial state. Therefore, the plan must include moving p1 to l2_3.

Thus, the plan is correct.

Therefore, the optimal plan is as described.
