Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. So, the goal is to get p1 to l2_3 and p2 to l1_3. The constraints are that at some point, p1 is in l2_2; another state where both p2 is in t2 and p1 is in l2_5; and another where p1 is in l2_5. Hmm.

First, let's look at the initial state. p1 is in l2_1 (airport in c2), and p2 is in l1_4 (city c1). The trucks t1 is in l1_2, t2 in l2_5. Airplanes a1 is in l1_1 (airport of c1), a2 in l2_1 (airport of c2).

For p1: Needs to go from l2_1 (c2's airport) to l2_3. Since l2_1 is an airport, maybe use a truck to move it. But wait, l2_1 is in c2. To move p1 to l2_3, which is also in c2. So perhaps load p1 into a truck in l2_1. Wait, but trucks can only move within their city. Wait, the trucks are t1 in c1 (since t1 is in l1_2 which is in c1) and t2 in c2 (since l2_5 is in c2). So t2 is in c2. So for p1 in l2_1 (c2), can we use t2? But t2 is initially at l2_5. So first, need to drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1? But wait, l2_1 is an airport. Are airports part of the city? Yes. So the cities have multiple locations, including an airport. So cities c1 and c2 each have their own locations, including an airport. So the drivetruck action can move between any locations in the same city.

So for p1: current location is l2_1 (airport in c2). To get to l2_3, which is in c2. So maybe drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1, load p1 into t2, then drive t2 to l2_3 and unload. But wait, initially, p1 is in l2_1. So if we can load p1 into t2 when t2 is in l2_1. So steps: drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (possible via drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2). Then loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1. Then drive t2 to l2_3, unload p1 there. That would get p1 to l2_3. But need to check constraints. The constraints require that p1 is in l2_5 at some state. Also, in the same state, p2 must be in t2. So maybe we need to have p1 pass through l2_5.

Wait, but how? Because initially, p1 is in l2_1. To get to l2_5, maybe we need to fly it via airplane. Wait, but l2_5 is a location in c2. Wait, airports are l1_1 and l2_1. So airplanes can only fly between airports. So if p1 is at l2_1 (airport), perhaps load it into airplane a2 (since a2 is in l2_1), fly to another airport, then use a truck. But why would we need that? Because maybe the constraints require p1 to be in l2_5. Wait, the first constraint says that p1 must be in l2_2 at some point. The second constraint requires that in some state, both p2 is in t2 and p1 is in l2_5. The third requires p1 in l2_5. So perhaps the second and third constraints can be satisfied in the same state. So we need p1 to be in l2_5 at least once.

So p1's journey: l2_1 -> ... -> l2_5 -> ... -> l2_3. How to get p1 to l2_5? Let's think. Since p1 starts at l2_1, which is an airport. Maybe load it into a truck, but the trucks in c2 are t2. But t2 is initially at l2_5. Wait, so initially, t2 is at l2_5, which is in c2. So to load p1 into t2, t2 needs to be at l2_1. So first, drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1. Then load p1 into t2. Then drive t2 back to l2_5, unload p1 there. Then drive t2 to l2_3 and unload. But that would require multiple steps. Let's outline:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 (now t2 is at l2_1)
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (p1 is in t2)
3. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2 (t2 moves back to l2_5)
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (now p1 is in l2_5)
   - At this point, the constraints about p1 being in l2_5 are met here. Also, if in the same state, p2 is in t2, then the second constraint is met. But p2 is in l1_4 (city c1). So how can p2 get into t2, which is in c2? Wait, t2 is a truck in c2, so it can only move within c2. So p2 is in c1. So to get p2 into t2 (which is in c2), we need to move p2 from c1 to c2. That would require using an airplane. Let's think about p2's movement.

p2 starts in l1_4 (c1). Need to get to l1_3 (c1). But the goal is to have p2 in l1_3. So for p2, maybe use t1 (truck in c1, currently at l1_2). So steps for p2:

- Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_4 (current location of p2)
- loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
- drive t1 to l1_3 and unload.

But wait, but there's a constraint that in some state, p2 is in t2 (which is a truck in c2). So how can p2 be in t2? Because t2 is in c2 and p2 is in c1. So p2 must be transported to c2. To do that, we need to use an airplane. So the plan for p2 would involve moving it to an airport in c1 (like l1_1), load into airplane a1, fly to l2_1 (airport of c2), then unload and load into t2. But t2 is in c2. Let's outline:

For p2:

1. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_4 (to pick up p2)
2. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
3. drive t1 to l1_1 (airport)
4. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (now p2 is at l1_1)
5. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (assuming a1 is there)
6. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (now a1 is at l2_1)
7. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (p2 is at l2_1 in c2)
8. Then, load p2 into t2 (if t2 is in l2_1)
   But earlier steps for p1 required driving t2 from l2_5 to l2_1. So if we do that, t2 is at l2_1. Then after unloading p2 at l2_1, we can load it into t2.

But how do these steps interact? Let's see. Let's try to combine the two plans.

But first, the constraints:

- At some point: p1 is in l2_2.
- At some point: p2 is in t2 AND p1 is in l2_5.
- At some point: p1 is in l2_5.

So, the second constraint requires both p2 in t2 and p1 in l2_5 in the same state. So maybe during the plan, after p1 is unloaded at l2_5 and p2 is loaded into t2, that's the state where both are true.

So let's structure the plan:

For p1:

- Drive t2 to l2_1, load p1, drive to l2_5, unload (so p1 is in l2_5 here)
- Then drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_3 and unload p1.

But wait, after unloading p1 at l2_5, p1 is there. Then to get to l2_3, need to drive t2 again to l2_3 and load p1 again. Wait, but after unloading p1 at l2_5, t2 is empty. So perhaps:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
3. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (now p1 is in l2_5)
   - This satisfies the third constraint and part of the second constraint (p1 in l2_5). Now, to get p1 to l2_3, we need to move it again. So:

5. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (but after step4, p1 is in l2_5, so load again? But why? Maybe drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_3 and unload, but p1 is already in l2_5. Wait, perhaps after step4, p1 is in l2_5. Then, we can drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2 (another location in c2), unload p1 there to satisfy the first constraint. Then drive to l2_3.

Wait, but then:

5. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
6. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (now p1 is in l2_2, satisfying first constraint)
7. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
8. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
9. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (goal achieved for p1)

But this seems longer. Alternatively, after step4, maybe drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2, load p1 again, then drive to l2_3. But p1 is already in l2_5. So to get to l2_2, need to load into t2 again. So steps:

After step4:

5. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (t2 is in l2_5, p1 is there)
6. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
7. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (satisfies first constraint)
8. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
9. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (goal)

But this requires more steps. But maybe this is necessary to meet the constraints.

For p2:

We need to get p2 from l1_4 (c1) to l1_3 (c1). But also, at some point, p2 must be in t2 (truck in c2). So the plan must involve moving p2 to c2, load into t2, then bring it back? But the goal is to have p2 in l1_3. So this seems complicated. Let's think.

Wait, maybe the constraint that p2 is in t2 can be satisfied during transport. For example, after moving p2 to c2, load into t2 (then p2 is in t2), then move it back to c1. But how?

Alternative approach: To meet the constraint that p2 is in t2, perhaps we have to transport p2 to c2, load into t2, then move it back. But the goal is to have p2 in l1_3. So the steps would be:

For p2:

1. In c1, use t1 to pick up p2 from l1_4 and move to airport l1_1.
2. Load into a1, fly to l2_1.
3. Unload into l2_1, then load into t2 (which is in l2_1, after driving there for p1's steps)
4. Then, fly back to l1_1, unload, etc. But this seems time-consuming.

Wait, but maybe after p2 is loaded into t2 (in c2), we can then fly it back to c1. Let's outline:

p2's journey:

Original location: l1_4 (c1)
Goal: l1_3 (c1)
Constraints: Must be in t2 (c2's truck) at some point.

So steps:

1. Drive t1 (in c1) from l1_2 to l1_4.
2. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4.
3. Drive t1 to l1_1 (airport).
4. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.
5. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1.
6. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (c2's airport).
7. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1.
8. At this point, t2 needs to be at l2_1. Let's assume t2 is driven there for p1's steps.

So after step3 for p1 (drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5), no, wait, in p1's steps, after step3, t2 is back at l2_5. Wait, maybe we need to adjust the order.

Wait, for p1's steps, maybe the order is:

- Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (step1)
- load p1 (step2)
- drive to l2_5 (step3)
- unload p1 (step4)
- then drive to l2_2 (step5), unload (step6)
- then drive to l2_3 (step7), unload (step8)

But during this time, t2 is moving in c2. So during the time when t2 is in l2_1 (after step1), perhaps we can load p2 into t2.

So when p2 is unloaded at l2_1 (step7 for p2), and t2 is at l2_1 (from p1's step1), we can load p2 into t2 (loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1). Then, when t2 is driven back to l2_5 (p1's step3), p2 is inside t2, so when we unload p1 at l2_5, p2 is still in t2. Wait, but then after unloading p1, p2 is still in t2, so that would satisfy the constraint that p2 is in t2 and p1 is in l2_5 in the same state.

Yes! So during p1's step4 (unload p1 at l2_5), p2 is in t2 (since it was loaded into t2 in l2_1 and t2 is driven to l2_5 with p2 inside). So after step4 (unloading p1), the state would have p1 in l2_5 and p2 in t2 (since t2 is at l2_5, and p2 hasn't been unloaded yet). Therefore, this state satisfies the second constraint (both p2 in t2 and p1 in l2_5). And the third constraint (p1 in l2_5) is also satisfied here.

So combining steps:

For p1 and p2:

p1's steps:
1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 (t2 is at l2_1)
p2's steps up to here:
1. drive t1 to l1_4, load p2, drive to l1_1, unload, load into a1, fly to l2_1, unload.
Now, p2 is at l2_1. So after step1 of p1, t2 is at l2_1. So:

2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (p2 is in t2)
3. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (p1 is loaded)
4. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2 (now t2 is at l2_5 with p1 and p2)
5. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (p1 is in l2_5, p2 still in t2)
   - Now, this state satisfies the second and third constraints.
6. Now, to get p1 to l2_3. Need to drive t2 to l2_3. But wait, t2 is currently at l2_5. So:

6. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2 (so t2 is at l2_2)
7. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (now p1 is in l2_2, satisfying first constraint)
8. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
9. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
10. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (goal for p1)

But wait, after step5, when p1 is unloaded at l2_5, p2 is still in t2. So after step5, to move t2 to l2_2, p2 is still in t2. So when we unload p1 at l2_2, p2 remains in t2. Then, after that, we need to get p2 back to c1. But the goal is to have p2 in l1_3. How?

Because p2 is in t2 (c2's truck) at l2_2. To get p2 back to c1, we need to unload it, then load it into airplane, fly to c1, then use truck in c1 to move to l1_3.

But how? Let's see:

After step10 (p1 is at l2_3), t2 is at l2_3. p2 is still in t2. So need to unload p2 from t2 in l2_3, then move it via airplane to c1. But l2_3 is not an airport. So need to drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1 (airport), unload p2, load into a2, fly to l1_1, unload, then use t1 (c1's truck) to move to l1_3.

So steps after step10:

11. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
12. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (now p2 is at l2_1)
13. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (a2 is in l2_1)
14. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
15. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (now p2 is at l1_1)
16. drive t1 (which was at l1_1 after previous steps) to l1_1 (but t1 is already there)
Wait, t1's initial position is l1_2. Earlier steps for p2 involved driving t1 to l1_4, then to l1_1, and unloading there. So after those steps, t1 is at l1_1. So to move p2 from l1_1 to l1_3:

16. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (but p2 is at l1_1, t1 is there)
17. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
18. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (goal for p2)

But this adds more steps. Also, the constraints require that p2 is in t2 at some state, which is already satisfied during steps 2-5. Now, the problem is to make sure all these steps are correct and that the constraints are met.

But let's check if the constraints are satisfied:

- Constraint 1: p1 is in l2_2. This happens after step7 (unload at l2_2). So that's covered.
- Constraint 2: p2 in t2 and p1 in l2_5. This happens after step5, where p1 is unloaded to l2_5 and p2 is still in t2. Wait, no. Wait, after step4: drivetruck t2 to l2_5, then step5 is unloadtruck p1. At that time, p1 is in l2_5, and p2 is in t2 (since we loaded p2 into t2 in step2 and it hasn't been unloaded yet). So step5's state satisfies the second constraint (p2 in t2 and p1 in l2_5).
- Constraint3: p1 in l2_5. Also satisfied at step5.

So the constraints are met. Now, the question is whether the plan is optimal (shortest possible). Let's see.

Alternative approach: Maybe find a way to combine steps so that some actions are used for both packages. Let's see.

Wait, during the step where t2 is driven from l2_1 to l2_5, it's carrying both p1 and p2. Then, after unloading p1, p2 remains in t2. Then, when driving to l2_2, p2 is still there. But how do we get p2 back to c1? It seems unavoidable to have multiple steps for that.

But perhaps there's a shorter path. Let's think again.

What if after p1 is unloaded at l2_5 (step5), we unload p2 there, then drive t2 to l2_3 with p1. But no, because p1 is already in l2_5. Wait, no, after step5, p1 is in l2_5, and p2 is in t2. To get p1 to l2_3, we have to reload p1 into t2 and drive. So:

Alternative steps:

After step5 (p1 in l2_5, p2 in t2):

6. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (now t2 has p1 and p2)
7. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_3 c2
8. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (now p1 is there)
9. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (now p2 is in l2_3, but goal is l1_3. Hmm, but l2_3 is in c2. So this is not helpful. So p2 needs to go back to c1.

So this approach doesn't work. Hence, the initial plan seems necessary.

But maybe we can find a way to move p2 back to c1 more efficiently.

Wait, after step5 (p1 in l2_5, p2 in t2):

6. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 (now t2 is at l2_1 with p2)
7. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (p2 is at l2_1)
8. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
9. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
10. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
11. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (t1 is at l1_1)
12. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
13. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

This would add steps, but perhaps it's necessary.

Now, combining all steps, the total plan would be:

For p1:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
For p2:
2. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1
3. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
4. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
5. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
6. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
7. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
8. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
9. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (t2 is there after step1)
10. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (p1 is there)
11. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
12. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (now p1 in l2_5, p2 in t2)
13. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
14. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (p1 in l2_2)
15. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
16. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
17. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (p1 done)
For p2:
18. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2 (drive back to airport)
19. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
20. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
21. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
22. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
23. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1 (assuming t1 is at l1_1)
24. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (wait, no, t1 was at l1_1 after step5. So after step5, t1 is at l1_1. Then step23 is drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1. But p2 is at l1_1 (step22), so need to load into t1 first.

So steps should be:

22. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (p2 at l1_1)
23. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (t1 is there)
24. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
25. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

This totals 25 steps, which seems long. Is there a shorter way?

Alternatively, for p2, after step12 (unload p1 at l2_5), p2 is in t2. Then, drive t2 to l2_1, unload p2, load into airplane, fly to c1, and then use t1 to move to l1_3.

But how many steps would that take?

So after step12 (p1 at l2_5, p2 in t2):

13. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
14. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
15. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
16. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
17. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
18. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1 (assuming t1 is at l1_1 from step5)
19. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (wait, p2 is at l1_1, t1 is at l1_1)
20. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
21. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

But steps 18 and 20 seem redundant. After step17, p2 is at l1_1. t1 is at l1_1 (from step5). So:

18. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
19. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
20. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

So steps13-20 for p2 after p1's step12.

But combining all steps:

For p1:
1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
3. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (after being flown to l2_1)
4. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
5. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (p1 in l2_5)
6. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
7. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
8. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
9. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
10. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
For p2:
11. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
12. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
13. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
14. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
15. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
16. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
17. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
18. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

Plus steps for moving p2 to l2_1:

But wait, how does p2 get to l2_1? Through airplane a1. So steps for p2:

a. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1
b. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
c. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
d. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
e. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
f. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
g. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

So steps a to g are necessary for p2 to get to l2_1.

Then, after step g, p2 is in l2_1, and t2 is at l2_1 (from step1). So step3 (loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1).

So combining all steps, the total plan would have:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 (p1's step)
2. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1 (p2's step a)
3. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (b)
4. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 (c)
5. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (d)
6. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (e)
7. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (f)
8. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (g)
9. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (step3)
10. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (step2)
11. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2 (step4)
12. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (step5)
13. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2 (step6)
14. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (step7)
15. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (step8)
16. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2 (step9)
17. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (step10)
18. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2 (step11)
19. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (step12)
20. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (step13)
21. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (step14)
22. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (step15)
23. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (step16)
24. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1 (step17)
25. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (step18)

That's 25 steps. This seems very long. Maybe there's a shorter way.

Alternative approach: Can p2 be loaded into t2 while it's moving p1, and then unloaded early?

Wait, perhaps after step11 (drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5), p1 and p2 are in t2. Then, when unloading p1 at l2_5, p2 is still in t2. Then, can we unload p2 at l2_5 and then move it via airplane from there? But l2_5 is not an airport. So t2 would need to drive p2 to l2_1 (airport) to load into airplane.

Alternatively, after step12, p1 is in l2_5. Then, we can unload p2 from t2 at l2_5, but then p2 is in l2_5. Then, to get it back to c1, we'd have to drive t2 to l2_1, load p2 into airplane, etc. But this adds steps.

Alternatively, maybe after unloading p1 at l2_5 (step12), drive t2 to l2_1 with p2 still inside, then unload p2 there, then fly it back. But again, this is similar to previous steps.

Wait, perhaps we can optimize by using a different airplane. For example, after p2 is in l2_1 (step8), use airplane a2 (which is already in l2_1) to fly to l1_1. Wait, but step7 is flyairplane a1 to l2_1, but a1 was in l1_1. So a1 is now in l2_1. So to fly p2 back, maybe use a2, which is already in l2_1.

So steps for p2 after step8 (unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1):

9. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (since a2 is in l2_1)
10. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
11. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

But wait, initial state says a2 is in l2_1. So yes, a2 is in l2_1. So instead of using a1 to fly p2 to l2_1, perhaps use a2 to fly back. But how? Because p2 is in l1_1 (after being loaded into a1 and flown to l2_1). Wait, no. Let's clarify:

Original state:

a1 is in l1_1 (c1's airport)
a2 is in l2_1 (c2's airport)

So to move p2 from l1_1 to l2_1, we can use a1 to fly it. Then, to move it back, use a2 to fly from l2_1 to l1_1.

But in the steps above, after loading p2 into a1 and flying to l2_1, a1 is now in l2_1. Then, to fly p2 back, we can use a2 (which is in l2_1) to fly to l1_1. So steps for p2 would be:

8. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (after flying a1 to l2_1)
9. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (using a2)
10. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
11. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

This saves steps since we don't need to move a1 back. So this could reduce the steps.

Let's rework p2's steps:

Original steps for p2:

a. drive t1 to l1_4, load p2.
b. drive to l1_1, unload.
c. load into a1, fly to l2_1.
d. unload from a1.
e. load into t2.
Then, after t2 moves to l2_5 and unloads p1, p2 is still in t2.
Then, when t2 returns to l2_1, unload p2.
f. load into a2, fly to l1_1.
g. unload, load into t1, drive to l1_3.

So steps for p2:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1
2. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
3. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
4. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
5. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
6. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
7. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
8. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (t2 is there after step1)
... steps for p1 ...
Later:
18. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 (to return t2 to l2_1)
19. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
20. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
21. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
22. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
23. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
24. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
25. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

This still totals 25 steps. But perhaps combining some steps.

Wait, after step7 (p2 is in l2_1), step8 is loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (since t2 is there from step1). Then, step9 is loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (since p1 is in l2_1). So t2 is loaded with both p1 and p2.

Then, step10: drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2.

Step11: unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5. Now, p2 is still in t2.

Then, step12: drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2.

Step13: unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2.

Step14: loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2.

Step15: drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2.

Step16: unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3.

Now, p2 is still in t2. Then:

Step17: drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2.

Step18: unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.

Step19: loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1.

Step20: flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

Step21: unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1.

Step22: loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

Step23: drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1.

Step24: unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3.

This is 24 steps, but perhaps some steps can be merged or reordered.

But is there a shorter path? Let's think about the constraints again.

The constraints require p1 to be in l2_2 and l2_5, and p2 to be in t2 with p1 in l2_5.

What if p1 is moved via airplane from l2_1 to another airport and then trucked? Wait, but p1 starts in l2_1 (airport of c2). To get to l2_3, which is in c2. So using a truck is the way to go.

But maybe using airplanes for p2's transport is necessary due to the constraint.

Alternatively, perhaps we can load p2 into t2 without using an airplane, but that's impossible because t2 is in c2 and p2 starts in c1.

So airplane is necessary for p2.

Now, let's try to find the minimal steps.

For p1:

Steps:

1. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1.
2. Load p1 into t2.
3. Drive t2 to l2_5, unload p1. (This meets the l2_5 constraint)
4. Drive t2 to l2_2, unload p1. (This meets l2_2 constraint)
5. Load p1, drive to l2_3, unload.

Total steps for p1: 5 actions (drive, load, drive, unload, drive, unload, load, drive, unload) → wait, no:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
3. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
5. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
6. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
7. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
8. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
9. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

That's 9 steps for p1.

For p2:

Steps:

1. Drive t1 to l1_4, load p2.
2. Drive to l1_1, unload.
3. Load into a1, fly to l2_1.
4. Unload into l2_1.
5. Load into t2 (when t2 is at l2_1).
   - This must happen after step1 of p1's steps.
6. Then, when t2 drives to l2_5, p2 is in t2.
7. After unloading p1 at l2_5, p2 is still in t2.
8. Drive t2 back to l2_1.
9. Unload p2.
10. Load into a2, fly to l1_1.
11. Unload.
12. Load into t1.
13. Drive to l1_3.
14. Unload.

Total steps for p2: 14 steps. But steps 1-5 are shared with p1's steps.

Combined total steps would be p1's 9 steps plus p2's 14 steps, but overlapping steps.

For example, step1 of p1 (drive t2 to l2_1) is also part of p2's steps. Similarly, step5 of p2 is loading into t2 while t2 is at l2_1.

So combining all steps:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 (p1)
2. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1 (p2)
3. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (p2)
4. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 (p2)
5. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (p2)
6. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (p2)
7. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (p2)
8. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (p2)
9. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (p2)
10. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (p1)
11. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2 (p1)
12. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (p1)
13. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2 (p1)
14. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (p1)
15. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (p1)
16. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2 (p1)
17. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (p1)
18. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2 (p2)
19. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (p2)
20. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (p2)
21. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (p2)
22. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (p2)
23. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (p2)
24. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1 (p2)
25. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (p2)

Total of 25 steps. Is there a way to make this shorter?

Alternative idea: Instead of moving t2 back to l2_1 after delivering p1, maybe use a different airplane for p2. For example, after step12 (p1 unloaded at l2_5), p2 is in t2. Then, drive t2 to l2_1, unload p2, load into a2, fly to l1_1, unload, load into t1, drive to l1_3. This would be steps 18-25 as before. But perhaps after step12, we can immediately move p2.

Wait, after step12 (unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5), p2 is in t2. So t2 is at l2_5. So:

13. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 (p2's step)
14. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (p2)
15. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (p2)
16. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (p2)
17. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (p2)
18. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (p2)
19. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1 (p2)
20. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (p2)

Meanwhile, for p1 after step12:

13. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2 (p1)
14. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (p1)
15. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (p1)
16. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2 (p1)
17. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (p1)

So combining:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 (p1)
2. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1 (p2)
3. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (p2)
4. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 (p2)
5. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (p2)
6. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (p2)
7. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (p2)
8. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (p2)
9. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (p2)
10. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (p1)
11. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2 (p1)
12. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (p1)
13. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 (p2)
14. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (p2)
15. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (p2)
16. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (p2)
17. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (p2)
18. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (p2)
19. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1 (p2)
20. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (p2)
21. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2 (p1)
22. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (p1)
23. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (p1)
24. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2 (p1)
25. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (p1)

This is still 25 steps, but the order of some steps is changed. However, this approach may have issues with dependencies. For example, after step13 (drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1), t2 is at l2_1, which is required for step14 (unload p2). Then, steps for p1 continue from step21 (drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2). But this requires that steps for p1 and p2 are interleaved, but the order must be correct.

Alternatively, can we parallelize steps for p1 and p2 where possible? For example, after step8 (p2 is in l2_1), we can load both p1 and p2 into t2 and move them together.

But the constraints require that p1 is in l2_5 and p2 is in t2 at the same state, which is achieved when t2 is at l2_5 after unloading p1. So the plan must ensure that.

After considering all possibilities, it seems that the optimal plan requires around 20 steps. However, I might be missing a more efficient way. Let's think again.

Alternative Idea: Use the airplane a2 to move p1 from l2_1 to l2_5's airport. Wait, but l2_5 is not an airport. Only l2_1 is an airport in c2. So airplanes can only land at l2_1. Therefore, to get p1 to l2_5, must use a truck. So the initial plan of using t2 to drive p1 from l2_1 to l2_5 is necessary.

Another Idea: Combine the steps where p1 and p2 are moved together. For example, after loading both into t2, drive t2 to l2_5, unload p1, then drive to l2_1 to unload p2 and fly back. But this still requires multiple steps.

Perhaps the minimal plan is 20 steps, but I'm not sure. Let me try to outline the steps again, combining where possible.

Final Attempt:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 (t2 moves to l2_1)
2. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1 (t1 picks up p2)
3. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
4. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 (t1 takes p2 to airport)
5. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
6. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
7. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (p2 arrives at l2_1)
8. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
9. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (p2 loaded into t2)
10. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (p1 loaded into t2)
11. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2 (t2 moves to l2_5)
12. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (p1 in l2_5, p2 in t2)
13. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2 (t2 moves to l2_2)
14. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (p1 in l2_2)
15. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
16. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
17. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (p1 done)
18. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2 (t2 returns to airport)
19. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (p2 unloaded)
20. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
21. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
22. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
23. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
24. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
25. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

This is 25 steps. Is there any redundancy?

For example, steps 18-19: After step17, t2 is at l2_3. To get p2 back to l2_1, we need to drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1. This is step18. Then unload p2 (step19). Then steps 20-25 to get p2 to l1_3.

But perhaps there's a way to have p2 in t2 and then unload earlier. But without violating the constraints, I don't see a shorter way.

Alternatively, after step12 (p1 in l2_5, p2 in t2), can we unload p2 in l2_5 and then fly it from l2_5? But l2_5 is not an airport. So no.

Thus, I think the minimal plan requires 25 steps. However, perhaps there's a smarter way to overlap steps.

Another Idea: When t2 is at l2_1 after step1, load both p1 and p2 into t2. Then drive to l2_5, unload p1. Then, drive to l2_2, unload p1. Then drive to l2_3, unload p1. Then, drive to l2_1, unload p2, and fly back. But p2 is in t2 until then.

Alternatively, after step12 (unload p1 at l2_5), p2 is in t2. Then, drive t2 to l2_3 and unload p1, then drive to l2_1 to unload p2. But how to get p1 to l2_2?

This seems challenging. Therefore, the initial plan seems necessary, and the answer must be the 25-step plan, but the problem asks for an optimal plan with minimal steps. But maybe there's a shorter way.

Wait, perhaps after step12, p1 is in l2_5 and p2 is in t2. Then, we can drive t2 to l2_2, unload p1 there (satisfying constraint1), then drive to l2_3 and unload p1. But during this time, p2 is in t2. So:

13. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2 (step13)
14. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (step14)
15. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (step15)
16. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2 (step16)
17. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (step17)
18. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2 (step18)
19. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (step19)
20. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (step20)
21. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (step21)
22. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (step22)
23. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (step23)
24. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1 (step24)
25. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (step25)

This is still 25 steps. Perhaps the optimal plan is indeed this, but I'm not sure. However, considering the constraints and the required steps, I think this is the minimal plan.
