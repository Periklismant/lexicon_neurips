Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. So, the goal is to get p1 to l1_4 and p2 to l1_2, right? But there are a bunch of constraints we need to satisfy as well. Let me break this down step by step.

First, let's look at the initial state. P1 is in l1_3, which is in city c1. P2 is in l1_5, also in c1. The trucks t1 and t2 are in l1_5 and l2_1 respectively. Airplanes a1 is in l1_1 (c1's airport) and a2 is in l2_1 (c2's airport). 

The constraints are a bit tricky. Let's list them out:

1. At some point, p1 must be in l1_3. Well, that's already true in the initial state. But wait, the problem says "must hold in at least one state". Since it's already there, maybe we don't need to do anything for this one. But wait, if the plan starts with moving p1 away immediately, then the first state after the initial might not have p1 in l1_3. But the initial state is considered a state, so maybe that's already satisfied. Hmm, need to check if the constraints are about the initial state or the states after actions. The problem says "in at least one state", so the initial state counts. So constraint 1 is already satisfied. But wait, the second constraint says if p1 is in l1_3 in some state s, then in s or a later state, p1 must be in l2_2. So because the initial state has p1 in l1_3, we have to ensure that at some point after that, p1 is in l2_2. So even if we leave p1 there initially, we still need to move it to l2_2 at some point. But our goal is to get p1 to l1_4. So that complicates things.

Similarly, for p2: we need it to be in l1_2 at some state (which is part of the goal), but also that before that, it was in l2_3. Also, p2 must be in t2 at some point.

So let's outline the steps for each package.

Starting with p1. The goal is l1_4, which is in c1. But to satisfy the constraint, after being in l1_3 (which is initial), it must reach l2_2. How can we get p1 from l1_3 to l2_2? Since l2_2 is in c2, we need to use an airplane. Let's see: maybe load p1 into a truck, drive it to the airport l1_1, load into airplane a1, fly to l2_1 (c2's airport), unload, then maybe use truck t2 to take it to l2_2. But wait, t2 is initially in l2_1. So steps could be:

1. Move p1 from l1_3 to l1_1 using truck t1. Wait, t1 is in l1_5. So first, need to drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_3. Then load p1 into t1, drive to l1_1, unload, load into airplane a1, fly to l2_1, unload into t2, drive to l2_2, unload. Then, since the goal is to have p1 in l1_4, we have to bring it back. Wait, that seems complicated. But the goal is l1_4, which is in c1. So after taking p1 to l2_2, we need to bring it back to c1. Hmm, that's a lot of steps.

Alternatively, maybe use another airplane. But airplanes can only go between airports. So if we take p1 to l2_1 via a1, then to l2_2 via truck t2, then to l2_1 again, fly back to l1_1, then use truck to l1_4. But this seems long. But perhaps necessary due to the constraints.

Wait, the constraint says that if p1 is in l1_3 (which it is initially), then at some point after, p1 must be in l2_2. So even if we move p1 from l1_3 directly to l1_4, but then we would have violated the constraint because we never took it to l2_2. So we must have a path that takes p1 from l1_3 to l2_2 and then back to l1_4.

Similarly for p2: the goal is l1_2, but before that, p2 must be in l2_3. Also, p2 must be in t2 at some point. So p2 starts in l1_5. To get to l2_3 (which is in c2), we need to transport it to c2. Maybe use airplane a1. Wait, but a1 is in l1_1. So steps for p2: load into truck t1 (which is at l1_5), drive to l1_1, load into a1, fly to l2_1, unload into t2 (which is at l2_1), drive t2 to l2_3, unload p2. Then, to get p2 to l1_2, we need to bring it back to c1. So load into a2 (which is at l2_1), fly to l1_1, unload into t1, drive to l1_2. But wait, a2 is in l2_1, so that's possible. But this also adds steps.

But let's see. Let's outline possible steps for both packages.

For p1:

Initial: l1_3 (c1)

Need to go to l2_2 (c2), then back to l1_4 (c1).

Possible steps:

1. Load p1 into a truck that can take it to the airport.

But p1 is in l1_3. The trucks in c1 are t1 (initially in l1_5). So first, drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_3.

Action: drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1

Then load p1 into t1.

Action: loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3

Then drive t1 to l1_1 (airport in c1).

Action: drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1

Unload p1 at l1_1.

Action: unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

Load p1 into airplane a1 (which is at l1_1).

Action: loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

Fly a1 to l2_1 (c2's airport).

Action: flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

Unload p1 from a1 into l2_1.

Action: unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

Now, p1 is in l2_1. To get it to l2_2, use truck t2 (which is in l2_1).

Load p1 into t2.

Action: loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

Drive t2 to l2_2.

Action: drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2

Unload p1 in l2_2. Now, the constraint for p1 is satisfied (it was in l1_3 initially, now in l2_2).

Now, to get p1 back to c1. Load into t2 again, drive back to l2_1, load into a2 (which is in l2_1), fly to l1_1, unload, then use truck to l1_4.

But a2 is in l2_1, so:

Load p1 into a2.

Action: loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

Fly a2 to l1_1.

Action: flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

Unload p1 into l1_1.

Action: unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

Now, use truck t1 (which is at l1_1) to drive to l1_4.

Wait, t1 was driven to l1_1 earlier. So it's at l1_1.

Load p1 into t1.

Action: loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

Drive t1 to l1_4.

Action: drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

Unload p1 into l1_4.

Action: unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

So that's the path for p1. Now, for p2.

p2 starts in l1_5 (c1). The goal is l1_2 (c1). Constraints: must be in l1_2 at some point (goal), but also must have been in l2_3 before that, and must be in t2 at some point.

So p2 needs to go from l1_5 to l2_3, then back to l1_2. Also, during this, p2 must be loaded into t2.

Possible steps:

p2 is in l1_5. Use truck t1 (which is initially in l1_5) to load p2.

But wait, t1 was used for p1. Let me check the timeline. After the steps for p1, t1 is at l1_4. Wait, no, after driving t1 to l1_4 and unloading p1, t1 is in l1_4. So for p2's initial steps, t1 is in l1_5 initially. Wait, the initial state says "Package t1 is in location l1_5". Wait, wait, the initial state says:

Wait, looking back at the original state:

"Package t1 is in location l1_5"

Wait, that's a mistake. Wait, no. The original state lists:

"Package t1 is in location l1_5"

But t1 is a truck. Trucks are not packages. Wait, this must be a typo. Let me check again.

The original state says:

"The original state of the world is the following:

...

"Package t1 is in location l1_5"

"Package t2 is in location l2_1"

"Package p1 is in location l1_3"

"Package p2 is in location l1_5"

"Package a1 is in location l1_1"

"Package a2 is in location l2_1"

Wait, this is confusing. The objects are:

"truck t1"

"truck t2"

"airplane a1"

"airplane a2"

So the entries like "Package t1 is in location l1_5" must be a mistake. Because t1 is a truck, not a package. So this is likely a typo. The correct initial positions for trucks and airplanes would be:

"Truck t1 is in location l1_5"

"Truck t2 is in location l2_1"

"Airplane a1 is in location l1_1"

"Airplane a2 is in location l2_1"

Because otherwise, the problem doesn't make sense. So I'll proceed under the assumption that the user made a typo and the correct initial positions are:

- Truck t1 is at l1_5

- Truck t2 is at l2_1

- Airplane a1 is at l1_1

- Airplane a2 is at l2_1

Because otherwise, the trucks and airplanes are listed as packages, which is impossible. So assuming that, let's proceed.

So for p2: starts at l1_5. Need to get to l2_3 first, then to l1_2. Also, must be in t2 at some point.

So first, move p2 from l1_5 to l1_1 (airport) using truck t1 (which is in l1_5).

Steps:

Load p2 into t1 at l1_5.

Action: loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

Drive t1 to l1_1.

Action: drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1

Unload p2 at l1_1.

Action: unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

Load p2 into a1.

Action: loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

Fly a1 to l2_1.

Action: flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

Unload p2 into l2_1.

Action: unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

Now, load p2 into t2 (which is in l2_1).

Action: loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

This satisfies the constraint that p2 is in t2 at some point.

Then drive t2 to l2_3.

Action: drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2

Unload p2 into l2_3. Now, the constraint that p2 was in l2_3 before being in l1_2 is satisfied.

Now, need to bring p2 back to c1. Load into t2 again, drive back to l2_1, load into a2, fly to l1_1, unload, then use truck to l1_2.

Steps:

Load p2 into t2 at l2_3.

Action: loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3

Drive t2 to l2_1.

Action: drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

Unload p2 at l2_1.

Action: unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

Load p2 into a2.

Action: loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

Fly a2 to l1_1.

Action: flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

Unload p2 into l1_1.

Action: unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

Now, load p2 into t1 (which is at l1_1, since we drove it there earlier for p1's transport).

Action: loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

Drive t1 to l1_2.

Action: drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1

Unload p2 into l1_2.

Action: unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

So that covers p2's journey.

Now, let's check the constraints:

1. p1 is in l1_3 (initial state) â†’ satisfied.

2. If p1 is in l1_3 (which it is initially), then at some later state, p1 is in l2_2. Which happens after transporting it to l2_2.

3. p2 must be in l1_2 (achieved at the end).

4. Before p2 is in l1_2, it was in l2_3 (achieved).

5. p2 must be in t2 (when it's loaded into t2 in l2_1 and driven to l2_3).

So all constraints are met.

Now, let's check the order of actions and possible optimizations.

But wait, let's list all the actions step by step for both packages, considering that some steps can be interleaved.

But perhaps it's better to handle p1 and p2's steps in parallel where possible.

But given the dependencies, maybe not. Let's outline the combined plan.

First, handle p1's movement to l2_2:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1

2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3

3. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1

4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

5. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

6. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

7. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

8. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

9. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2

10. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

Then bring p1 back:

11. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

12. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2

13. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

14. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

15. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

16. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

17. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

18. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

19. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

Now for p2:

Starting after step 19? No, can interleave.

But some steps depend on trucks and airplanes. Let's see when t1 is available.

t1 is used in steps 1-4, then again in steps 17-19. Between steps 4 and 17, t1 is at l1_1. So p2's steps can use t1 after step 4.

But p2's initial steps:

p2 is in l1_5. So first, load into t1 (which is at l1_5). Wait, t1 starts at l1_5. But in step 1, we drive t1 to l1_3. So after step 1, t1 is at l1_3, then after step 3, it's at l1_1. So to load p2 into t1, we need t1 to be at l1_5. But after step 1, t1 is at l1_3, then step 3 takes it to l1_1. So perhaps we need to handle p2's loading into t1 before moving t1 for p1.

Wait, that's a problem. Because t1 starts at l1_5. p2 is at l1_5. So initial steps for p2 could be:

Load p2 into t1 at l1_5.

But t1 is needed for p1's transport. So perhaps first handle p2's initial steps before moving t1.

But let's see:

If we first load p2 into t1, drive t1 to l1_1, unload p2, then proceed with p1's steps.

But p1 is in l1_3. So steps could be:

First, load p2 into t1 at l1_5.

Action: loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

Then drive t1 to l1_1.

Action: drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1

Unload p2 at l1_1.

Action: unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

Then, t1 is at l1_1. But p1 is in l1_3, so to move p1, we need to get t1 to l1_3. So after unloading p2 at l1_1, drive t1 back to l1_3.

Action: drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1

Then proceed with loading p1 into t1.

But this adds steps. Let's count:

For p2:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

2. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1

3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

4. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1 (to get t1 to p1's location)

Then proceed with p1's steps.

But this adds steps. Alternatively, perhaps use another truck. But in c1, the only truck is t1. Because the problem states trucks t1 and t2, with t2 in l2_1 (c2). So in c1, only t1 is available.

So p2's transport from l1_5 to l1_1 must use t1, which is then used for p1's transport.

So the plan would have to interleave these steps.

Alternatively, maybe move p1 first, then move p2. But p1's first step requires driving t1 from l1_5 to l1_3. So after that, t1 is at l1_3. Then after loading p1 and driving to l1_1, t1 is there. Then, for p2, we need to get t1 back to l1_5 to load p2. Which would require driving t1 from l1_1 to l1_5.

But that's a lot of back-and-forth.

Alternatively, maybe find a way to handle p2's movement without using t1 again. But how?

Wait, p2 needs to be loaded into t2 at some point (constraint 5). But t2 is in c2. So perhaps p2's journey to l2_3 is via t2. But to get p2 to c2, we have to use an airplane from c1's airport.

So steps for p2:

Initial: l1_5.

Use t1 to drive to l1_1, then load into a1, fly to l2_1, then load into t2, drive to l2_3. Then back.

But to use t1 for this, we need to have t1 available.

But t1 is also needed for p1's transport. So maybe the plan is:

First, handle p2's transport to l2_3, then handle p1's transport, but this might complicate the constraints.

Alternatively, let's think of the optimal plan. The user wants an optimal plan with minimal steps.

But given the constraints, the steps are quite involved. Let's try to outline the steps in order.

Possible sequence:

For p2:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

2. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1

3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

4. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

6. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

7. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (now p2 is in t2, satisfying constraint 5)

8. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2

9. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (now p2 is in l2_3, satisfying the before condition for l1_2)

10. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3

11. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

12. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

13. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

14. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

15. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

16. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (t1 is at l1_1 after step 2 and 3)

17. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1

18. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (p2 goal achieved)

For p1:

19. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1 (wait, after step 17, t1 is at l1_2. To get to l1_3, need to drive. But maybe this is not possible. This is getting complicated because t1 is being used for both packages.

Wait, this approach might not work. Because after step 17, t1 is at l1_2. So for p1's transport, we need to get t1 back to l1_3 to load p1.

But this would add more steps. So perhaps the optimal plan requires handling p1 and p2's transport in a way that minimizes backtracking.

Alternatively, perhaps the plan can interleave steps for p1 and p2 to use resources more efficiently.

Let me try to create a combined plan.

Here's an attempt:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 (p2 into t1)

2. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1 (drive to airport)

3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (unload p2)

4. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (load into a1)

5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (fly to c2)

6. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (unload p2)

7. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (p2 into t2, satisfying constraint)

8. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2 (drive to l2_3)

9. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (now p2 was in l2_3)

10. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (load back into t2)

11. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2 (return to airport)

12. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (unload)

13. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (load into a2)

14. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (fly back to c1)

15. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (unload)

16. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (t1 is here after step 3)

17. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1 (drive to l1_2)

18. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (p2 goal done)

Now for p1:

19. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1 (drive t1 to p1's location)

20. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (load p1)

21. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1 (drive back to airport)

22. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (unload)

23. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (load into a1)

24. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (fly to c2)

25. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 (unload)

26. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (load into t2)

27. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2 (drive to l2_2)

28. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (now p1 is in l2_2, satisfying constraint)

29. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (load back)

30. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 (return to airport)

31. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (unload)

32. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (load into a2)

33. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (fly back)

34. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (unload)

35. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (t1 is at l1_2 now? Wait, after step 17, t1 was driven to l1_2. Step 19 drives it to l1_3. Then step 21 drives it back to l1_1. So after step 21, t1 is at l1_1. So step 35 is possible.

35. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

36. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

37. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4 (goal done)

But this plan has 37 steps, which is very long. There must be a more optimal way.

Wait, perhaps we can reuse some steps. For example, when a1 is flown to l2_1 for p2, maybe it can also carry p1 on the return trip. But no, p1's journey requires going to l2_2, which is in c2, then back to c1.

Alternatively, perhaps combining the use of airplanes. For example, after flying a1 to l2_1 with p2, it can stay there, and then a2 can be used for other flights. But this requires careful planning.

Alternatively, let's think of p1's journey:

p1 needs to go from l1_3 â†’ l2_2 â†’ l1_4.

To get to l2_2, use t1 to drive to l1_1, fly to l2_1, use t2 to l2_2.

But after that, to return to c1, use a2 to fly back.

Similarly for p2: l1_5 â†’ l2_3 â†’ l1_2.

But maybe some steps can be shared.

Wait, let's try to interleave the steps.

Here's a more optimized approach:

For p2:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

2. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1

3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

4. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

6. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

7. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

8. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2

9. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3

10. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3

11. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

12. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

13. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

14. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

15. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

16. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

17. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1

18. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

For p1:

19. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1 (t1 was at l1_2 after step 17)

20. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3

21. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1

22. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

23. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (a1 is at l2_1 after step 5, so cannot use a1. Need to use a2?)

Wait, after step 5, a1 is at l2_1. So to fly p1 to l2_1, perhaps use a1 again.

But after step 5, a1 is at l2_1. So to use it again, we need to fly it back. But that adds steps.

Alternatively, use a2 to fly p1 from l1_1 to l2_1.

But a2 is at l2_1 initially. So after step 14, a2 is flown to l1_1. So after step 14, a2 is at l1_1. So step 23 could be load p1 into a2 and fly to l2_1.

But then:

23. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

24. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1

25. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

Then load into t2:

26. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

27. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2

28. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

Then, to get p1 back, fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1 again (but a2 was flown to l2_1 in step 24).

But after step 24, a2 is at l2_1. So steps:

29. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

30. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

31. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

32. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

33. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

34. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

This adds more steps.

This approach would result in 34 steps. But maybe there's a better way.

Alternatively, after p2 is transported to l2_3 and back, a2 is at l1_1. So for p1's return trip, use a2 to fly back from l2_1 to l1_1.

But this requires a2 to be available.

Wait, this is getting very complicated. Let's think of the minimal steps required for each package.

For p1:

- Drive t1 to l1_3 (1 step)

Total: 19 steps for p1.

For p2:

- Load into t1 (1)

- Drive to l1_1 (1)

- Unload (1)

- Load into a1 (1)

- Fly to l2_1 (1)

- Unload (1)

- Load into t2 (1)

- Drive back to l2_1 (1)

- Unload (1)

- Load into a2 (1)

- Fly to l1_1 (1)

- Unload (1)

- Load into t1 (1)

- Drive to l1_2 (1)

- Unload (1)

Total: 18 steps for p2.

But since some steps can be shared (like using the same flight for both packages), perhaps the total steps can be reduced. But given the dependencies, it's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps perform the steps for p2 first, then p1, but this may not save steps.

Another angle: the constraint for p1 requires that after being in l1_3 (initially), it must reach l2_2. So we must take p1 to l2_2. But the goal is to have it in l1_4. So the steps for p1 are unavoidable.

Similarly for p2.

Given that, the minimal plan length would be around 19 + 18 = 37 steps. But this seems too long, so perhaps there's a smarter way.

Wait, maybe we can reuse the airplane flights. For example, after flying a1 to l2_1 with p2, we can fly it back with p1. But timing is important.

Let me try to create a step-by-step plan that combines both packages' actions optimally.

Here's an attempt:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

2. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1

3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

4. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

6. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

7. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

8. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2

9. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3

10. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3

11. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

12. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

13. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

14. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

15. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

16. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

17. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1

18. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

Now p2 is done. Now handle p1:

19. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1

20. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3

21. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1

22. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

23. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (a2 is at l1_1 after step 14)

24. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1

25. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

26. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

27. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2

28. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

29. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

30. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2

31. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

32. loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 (a1 is at l2_1 from step 5)

33. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1

34. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

35. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

36. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

37. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

This gives a total of 37 steps, but I'm not sure if this is the minimal. Is there a way to optimize further?

For example, after step 14, a2 is flown to l1_1. Then in step 23, p1 is loaded into a2 and flown back to l2_1. But a2 was just flown from l2_1 to l1_1 in step 14. So step 24 flies it back to l2_1. This is possible, but adds steps.

Alternatively, use a1 to fly p1 back. After step 5, a1 is at l2_1. After step 33, fly a1 back to l1_1.

But this requires steps to be ordered correctly.

Alternatively, after p2 is transported, use a1 (which is at l2_1) to fly p1 back. Let's see:

After step 5, a1 is at l2_1. After step 6, unload p2. Then, for p1:

After step 28 (unload p1 in l2_2), to bring it back, load into t2, drive to l2_1, unload, load into a1, fly to l1_1.

So steps:

29. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

30. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2

31. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

32. loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

33. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1

34. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

35. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

36. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

37. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

This saves a few steps compared to using a2. So total steps for p1 would be from 19 to 19 steps.

But overall, this still results in a long plan.

Another angle: the constraint for p1's l2_2 can be satisfied during the plan, even if p1 is later moved to the goal. So perhaps we don't need to bring p1 back via airplane. Wait, but the goal is l1_4, which is in c1. So p1 must be in l1_4, which requires being back in c1.

So the steps are unavoidable.

Given all this, it seems the minimal plan is indeed quite long. However, perhaps there's a smarter way to handle the constraints.

Wait, the constraint for p1 says that if it's in l1_3 at any state, then it must be in l2_2 at that state or later. Since p1 starts in l1_3, we must ensure it reaches l2_2 at some point. However, if we move p1 directly from l1_3 to l1_4 without going to l2_2, that would violate the constraint. So we have to take it to l2_2.

But the problem says the plan must satisfy all constraints, so this step is mandatory.

Similarly for p2's constraints.

Given that, the plan must include these steps. Therefore, the optimal plan must include the necessary steps to move each package to their required intermediate locations, then to their goals.

After several iterations, the plan outlined earlier seems to be the only way. Therefore, the answer is the sequence of actions that accomplishes all these steps.
