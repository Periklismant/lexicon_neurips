Alright, I'm given a planning problem involving trucks, airplanes, and packages in a transportation logistics domain. The goal is to get package p1 to location l1_4 and package p2 to location l1_2. There are also several constraints:

1. Package p1 must be in location l1_3 at some point.
2. If p1 is in l1_3, then it must also, at some point later, be in location l2_2.
3. Package p2 must be in location l1_2 at some point (which is also part of the final goal).
4. If p2 is in l1_2, there must be an earlier state where it was in location l2_3.
5. Package p2 must be in truck t2 at some point.

Let's analyze this problem step by step.

First, let's understand the initial state:
- Locations l1_1 through l1_5 are in city c1.
- Locations l2_1 through l2_5 are in city c2.
- l1_1 and l2_1 are airports.
- Package p1 is in location l1_3.
- Package p2 is in location l1_5.
- Truck t1 is in location l1_5.
- Truck t2 is in location l2_1.
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1.
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1.

Now, let's sketch out a plan considering the constraints:

For p1:
1. p1 starts in l1_3 (which satisfies the first constraint).
2. We can load p1 onto a truck, drive it to the airport (l1_1), and load it onto an airplane.
3. Fly the airplane to l2_1 (the airport in city c2).
4. Unload p1, load it onto a truck, and drive to l2_2 (satisfying the second constraint).
5. Then, we reverse: load onto truck, drive to airport, load onto airplane, fly to l1_1, unload, load onto truck, drive to l1_4 (satisfying the goal for p1).

For p2:
1. p2 starts in l1_5.
2. We can load p2 onto a truck (t1 is already there), drive it to the airport (l1_1), and load it onto an airplane.
3. Fly the airplane to l2_1 (the airport in city c2).
4. Unload p2, load it onto t2 (satisfying the fifth constraint).
5. Drive t2 to l2_3 (satisfying the fourth constraint).
6. Drive t2 back to the airport (l2_1).
7. Load p2 onto an airplane, fly to l1_1, unload.
8. Load p2 onto a truck, drive to l1_2 (satisfying the third constraint and the goal for p2).

Now, I need to ensure this plan is optimal, meaning there's no shorter valid plan that satisfies all the constraints. Let's refine this and provide the exact sequence of actions.

Actually, I need to be more careful reading the initial state. I'll extract it again:

- "Location l1_1 is in city c1"
- "Location l1_2 is in city c1"
- "Location l1_3 is in city c1"
- "Location l1_4 is in city c1"
- "Location l1_5 is in city c1"
- "Location l2_1 is in city c2"
- "Location l2_2 is in city c2"
- "Location l2_3 is in city c2"
- "Location l2_4 is in city c2"
- "Location l2_5 is in city c2"
- "Package t1 is in location l1_5"
- "Package t2 is in location l2_1"
- "Package p1 is in location l1_3"
- "Package p2 is in location l1_5"
- "Package a1 is in location l1_1"
- "Package a2 is in location l2_1"

It seems like there's a mistake in the initial state. Instead of "Package t1 is in location l1_5", it should probably be "Truck t1 is in location l1_5". Similarly for t2, a1, and a2. Let's correct this:

- Truck t1 is in location l1_5
- Truck t2 is in location l2_1
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1
- Package p1 is in location l1_3
- Package p2 is in location l1_5

With the corrected initial state, let's come up with a plan:

For p1:
1. We need to load p1 onto a truck in l1_3, so we first drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_3.
2. Load p1 onto t1 in l1_3.
3. Drive t1 to the airport (l1_1).
4. Transfer p1 from t1 to airplane a1.
5. Fly a1 to l2_1 (the airport in city c2).
6. Unload p1 from a1.
7. Load p1 onto t2 (which is already at l2_1).
8. Drive t2 to l2_2 (satisfying the second constraint).
9. Drive t2 back to l2_1.
10. Load p1 onto a1 again.
11. Fly a1 back to l1_1.
12. Unload p1.
13. Load p1 onto a truck (t1 if it's back at the airport).
14. Drive the truck to l1_4.
15. Unload p1 in l1_4 (satisfying the goal for p1).

For p2:
1. p2 starts in l1_5, and t1 is also in l1_5 initially.
2. Load p2 onto t1.
3. Drive t1 to the airport (l1_1).
4. Transfer p2 from t1 to airplane a1.
5. Fly a1 to l2_1.
6. Unload p2 from a1.
7. Load p2 onto t2 (satisfying the fifth constraint).
8. Drive t2 to l2_3 (satisfying the fourth constraint).
9. Drive t2 back to l2_1.
10. Load p2 onto an airplane.
11. Fly the airplane to l1_1.
12. Unload p2.
13. Load p2 onto a truck.
14. Drive the truck to l1_2.
15. Unload p2 in l1_2 (satisfying the third constraint and the goal for p2).

Now, to make this more efficient, we can interleave these two plans. Let's sketch a complete, optimized plan:

1. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_3.
2. Load p1 onto t1 in l1_3.
3. Drive t1 to l1_5.
4. Load p2 onto t1 in l1_5.
5. Drive t1 to the airport (l1_1).
6. Transfer p1 from t1 to airplane a1.
7. Transfer p2 from t1 to airplane a1.
8. Fly a1 to l2_1.
9. Unload p1 from a1.
10. Unload p2 from a1.
11. Load p1 onto t2.
12. Load p2 onto t2 (satisfying the fifth constraint).
13. Drive t2 to l2_2 (satisfying the second constraint for p1).
14. Drive t2 to l2_3 (satisfying the fourth constraint for p2).
15. Drive t2 back to l2_1.
16. Load p1 onto a1.
17. Load p2 onto a1.
18. Fly a1 back to l1_1.
19. Unload p1.
20. Unload p2.
21. Load p1 onto t1.
22. Load p2 onto t1.
23. Drive t1 to l1_4.
24. Unload p1 in l1_4 (satisfying the goal for p1).
25. Drive t1 to l1_2.
26. Unload p2 in l1_2 (satisfying the third constraint and the goal for p2).

Let me double-check this plan against the constraints:

1. p1 must be in l1_3 at some point: p1 starts there, so this is satisfied.
2. If p1 is in l1_3, it must later be in l2_2: We drive p1 to l2_2 in step 13, which is after its initial location at l1_3.
3. p2 must be in l1_2 at some point: p2 is brought to l1_2 in step 26.
4. If p2 is in l1_2, there must be an earlier state where it was in l2_3: p2 is in l2_3 in step 14, which precedes its arrival at l1_2 in step 26.
5. p2 must be in t2 at some point: p2 is loaded onto t2 in step 12.

I think this plan satisfies all the constraints.

Actually, let's double-check our interleaved plan again. I want to make sure we're not having any packages in two places at once:

1. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_3.
2. Load p1 onto t1 in l1_3.
3. Drive t1 to l1_5.
4. Load p2 onto t1 in l1_5.
5. Drive t1 to the airport (l1_1).
6. Transfer p1 from t1 to airplane a1.
7. Transfer p2 from t1 to airplane a1.
8. Fly a1 to l2_1.
9. Unload p1 from a1.
10. Unload p2 from a1.
11. Load p1 onto t2.
12. Load p2 onto t2 (satisfying the fifth constraint).
13. Drive t2 to l2_2 (satisfying the second constraint for p1).
14. Drive t2 to l2_3 (satisfying the fourth constraint for p2).
15. Drive t2 back to l2_1.
16. Load p1 onto a1.
17. Load p2 onto a1.
18. Fly a1 back to l1_1.
19. Unload p1.
20. Unload p2.
21. Load p1 onto t1.
22. Load p2 onto t1.
23. Drive t1 to l1_4.
24. Unload p1 in l1_4 (satisfying the goal for p1).
25. Drive t1 to l1_2.
26. Unload p2 in l1_2 (satisfying the third constraint and the goal for p2).

I think this plan is coherent and keeps track of package locations. But to be optimally efficient, we can probably do better. We just need to ensure all the constraints are met without unnecessary actions:

1. For p1:
   - It starts in l1_3 (already satisfying a constraint).
   - It must visit l2_2 after being in l1_3.
   - It must end in l1_4.

2. For p2:
   - It starts in l1_5.
   - It must visit l2_3 before going to l1_2.
   - It must be in t2 at some point.
   - It must end in l1_2.

Given the requirements, I'll refine the plan one more time for efficiency.

Let me see if there's a mistake in the plan. I don't think t1 can go to l2_1 directly, since it's in a different city (c1 vs c2). And similarly, I don't think t2, which is in city c2, can transfer packages between city c1 and city c2. Let me refine this again.

Both p1 and p2 need to get from city c1 to city c2 and then back to city c1, and they need to meet certain constraints along the way. The way to transit between cities is via airports (l1_1 in city c1 and l2_1 in city c2).

Let me try to formulate the plan again:

1. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_3.
2. Load p1 onto t1 in l1_3.
3. Drive t1 to l1_5.
4. Load p2 onto t1 in l1_5.
5. Drive t1 to the airport l1_1.
6. Unload p1 from t1.
7. Unload p2 from t1.
8. Load p1 onto a1.
9. Load p2 onto a1.
10. Fly a1 to l2_1 (airport in city c2).
11. Unload p1 from a1.
12. Unload p2 from a1.
13. Load p1 onto t2.
14. Load p2 onto t2 (satisfying the "p2 must be in t2" constraint).
15. Drive t2 to l2_2 (satisfying the "p1 must be in l2_2 after being in l1_3" constraint).
16. Drive t2 to l2_3 (satisfying the "p2 must be in l2_3 before being in l1_2" constraint).
17. Drive t2 back to l2_1.
18. Unload p1 from t2.
19. Unload p2 from t2.
20. Load p1 onto a1.
21. Load p2 onto a1.
22. Fly a1 back to l1_1.
23. Unload p1 from a1.
24. Unload p2 from a1.
25. Load p1 onto t1.
26. Load p2 onto t1.
27. Drive t1 to l1_4.
28. Unload p1 in l1_4 (satisfying the goal for p1).
29. Drive t1 to l1_2.
30. Unload p2 in l1_2 (satisfying the goal for p2).

Let me check this plan against the constraints:

1. p1 must be in l1_3 at some point: p1 starts there, so this is satisfied.
2. If p1 is in l1_3, it must later be in l2_2: We drive p1 to l2_2 in step 15, which is after its initial location at l1_3.
3. p2 must be in l1_2 at some point: p2 is brought to l1_2 in step 30.
4. If p2 is in l1_2, there must be an earlier state where it was in l2_3: p2 is in l2_3 in step 16, which precedes its arrival at l1_2 in step 30.
5. p2 must be in t2 at some point: p2 is loaded onto t2 in step 14.

I think this plan satisfies all the constraints. Let's ensure that the actions are legitimate according to the rules:

The actions of this domain have the following preconditions:
- "loadtruck": You may only load package p in a truck t if p and t are in the same location l.
  - Checks out in our plan.
- "loadairplane": You may only load package p in a airplane ap if ap and t are in the same location l.
  - It should be "ap and p are in the same location l", not "ap and t". Checks out in our plan.
- "unloadtruck": You may only unload package p from a truck t in a location l if (i) t is situated in l, and (ii) p is in t.
  - Checks out in our plan.
- "unloadairplane": You may only unload package p from a airplane ap in a location l if (i) ap is situated in l, and (ii) p is in ap.
  - Checks out in our plan.
- "drivetruck": You may only move a truck t from location l_from to location l_to in a city c if (i) t is situated in l_from, and (ii) l_from and l_to are locations of c.
  - Checks out in our plan.
- "flyairplane": You may only fly an airplane ap from location l_from to location l_to if ap is situated in l_from.
  - Checks out in our plan, although the second location needs to be an airport. I've been using the airports l1_1 and l2_1 for airplane travel.

Now, to ensure that the plan is optimal, I'll check if any steps can be removed or optimized:

- We need to transit both packages via the airport and airplane to move between cities.
- Each package has specific locations it must visit, which are not on the shortest path.
- We have both packages sharing transportation whenever possible to reduce the number of steps.

The 30-step plan seems pretty efficient, but let me see if there are any redundancies:

1. For p1, we need: l1_3 (start) -> l2_2 (constraint) -> l1_4 (goal).
2. For p2, we need: l1_5 (start) -> t2 (constraint) -> l2_3 (constraint before l1_2) -> l1_2 (goal).

Given these requirements, I believe the 30-step plan is optimal. But let's make sure the exact action names match the provided format.

Let me translate these into the exact actions from the problem statement:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
3. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_5 c1
4. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
5. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
6. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
7. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
8. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
9. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
10. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
11. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
12. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
13. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
14. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
15. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
16. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
17. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
18. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
19. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
20. loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
21. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
22. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
23. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
24. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
25. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
26. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
27. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
28. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
29. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1
30. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

Oops, there's a mistake in my previous translation. The line:
```
"loadairplane p ap l": Unload package p from airplane ap in location l.
```
Should probably be:
```
"unloadairplane p ap l": Unload package p from airplane ap in location l.
```

So, the correct actions are:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
3. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_5 c1
4. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
5. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
6. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
7. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
8. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
9. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
10. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
11. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
12. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
13. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
14. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
15. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
16. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
17. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
18. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
19. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
20. loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
21. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
22. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
23. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
24. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
25. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
26. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
27. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
28. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
29. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1
30. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

I believe this is the optimal plan that satisfies all constraints.

Let me double check whether we might be able to combine some steps and optimize the plan. 

The packages have different constraints and goals, but I can see that in the current plan, both p1 and p2 are loaded onto a1 together, flown to city c2, put on t2 together, and then after t2 visits both l2_2 and l2_3, both packages are loaded onto a1 again, flown back to city c1, put on t1, and then delivered to their respective goal locations.

This seems like a pretty efficient plan already since we're combining the transportation of the two packages whenever possible. I'm not seeing any obvious redundancies or steps that could be skipped.

So, the final 30-step plan:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
3. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_5 c1
4. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
5. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
6. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
7. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
8. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
9. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
10. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
11. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
12. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
13. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
14. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
15. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
16. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
17. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
18. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
19. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
20. loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
21. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
22. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
23. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
24. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
25. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
26. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
27. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
28. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
29. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1
30. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
