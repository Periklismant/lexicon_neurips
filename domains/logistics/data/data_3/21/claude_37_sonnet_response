Let me analyze this problem carefully:

First, let me understand the initial state:
- Locations l1_1, l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5 are in city c1
- Locations l2_1, l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5 are in city c2
- l1_1 and l2_1 are airports
- t1 (a truck) is in location l1_2 (city c1)
- t2 (a truck) is in location l2_4 (city c2)
- p1 (a package) is in location l2_2 (city c2)
- p2 (a package) is in location l2_4 (city c2)
- a1 (an airplane) is in location l1_1 (airport in city c1)
- a2 (an airplane) is in location l2_1 (airport in city c2)

The goal is:
- p1 should be in location l2_2
- p2 should be in location l1_5

There are several constraints:
1. At some point, p1 must be in l2_4 and p2 must be in l1_3
2. At some point, p2 must be in l2_1
3. If p2 is in l2_1, then p1 must be in l1_1 or l1_2 at that point or after
4. At some point, p2 must be in l1_1
5. If p2 is in l1_1, then p2 must be in l2_2 or p1 must be in l2_3 at that point or after

Let's first check the initial state:
- p1 is already in l2_2, which matches its goal location. However, we need to move it to satisfy constraints.
- p2 is in l2_4, but its goal is l1_5. We need to move it.

Since p1 is already at its goal location (l2_2), we need to temporarily move it to fulfill the constraints and then bring it back. Similarly, p2 needs to be moved from l2_4 to l1_5, fulfilling constraints along the way.

Let's start planning:

First, we need to ensure that at some point:
- p1 is in l2_4
- p2 is in l1_3

To move p1 from l2_2 to l2_4, we can:
1. Load p1 onto truck t2 at l2_2
2. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_4
3. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_4

To move p2 from l2_4 to l1_3, we need to:
1. Load p2 onto truck t2 at l2_4
2. Drive t2 to l2_1 (airport)
3. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1
4. Load p2 onto airplane a2
5. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1
6. Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1
7. Load p2 onto truck t1
8. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_3
9. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_3

Wait, I just realized there might be an issue with the initial state. It says "Package t1 is in location l1_2", "Package t2 is in location l2_4", etc. But t1 and t2 are trucks, not packages. Similarly, a1 and a2 are airplanes, not packages. Let me re-interpret this:

- Truck t1 is in location l1_2 (city c1)
- Truck t2 is in location l2_4 (city c2)
- Package p1 is in location l2_2 (city c2)
- Package p2 is in location l2_4 (city c2)
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (airport in city c1)
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1 (airport in city c2)

That makes more sense.

Let's continue with the planning:

For constraint 1:
- p1 should be in l2_4
- p2 should be in l1_3

For constraint 2:
- p2 should be in l2_1

For constraint 3:
- If p2 is in l2_1, then p1
- p1 should be in l1_1 or l1_2

For constraint 4:
- p2 should be in l1_1

For constraint 5:
- If p2 is in l1_1, then 
  - p2 should be in l2_2 or 
  - p1 should be in l2_3

Let's devise a plan:

1. Move p1 from l2_2 to l2_4:
   - Load p1 onto truck t2 at l2_2 (requires moving t2 from l2_4 to l2_2 first)
   - Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_4
   - Unload p1 from t2 at l2_4

2. Move p2 to l1_3:
   - Load p2 onto truck t2 at l2_4
   - Drive t2 to l2_1 (airport)
   - Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1 (satisfying constraint 2)
   - During this time, p1 is in l2_4, so constraint 3 requires that p1 needs to be moved to l1_1 or l1_2
   - Load p2 onto airplane a2
   - Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1
   - Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1 (satisfying constraint 4)
   - During this time, constraint 5 requires that p2 should be in l2_2 or p1 should be in l2_3
   - Load p2 onto truck t1
   - Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_3
   - Unload p2 from t1 at l1_3 (satisfying constraint 1 along with p1 in l2_4)

3. Move p1 back to l2_2 (its goal):
   - Load p1 onto truck t2 at l2_4
   - Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_2
   - Unload p1 from t2 at l2_2

4. Move p2 to l1_5 (its goal):
   - Load p2 onto truck t1 at l1_3
   - Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_5
   - Unload p2 from t1 at l1_5

But there's a complication: we need to satisfy constraint 3 (p1 in l1_1 or l1_2) when p2 is in l2_1, and constraint 5 (p2 in l2_2 or p1 in l2_3) when p2 is in l1_1.

Let me revise the plan:

1. Move p1 from l2_2 to l1_2 (to satisfy constraint 3):
   - Load p1 onto truck t2 at l2_2
   - Drive t2 to l2_1 (airport)
   - Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1
   - Load p1 onto airplane a2
   - Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1
   - Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1
   - Load p1 onto truck t1
   - Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_2
   - Unload p1 from t1 at l1_2

2. Move p2 to l2_1 (satisfying constraint 2):
   - Load p2 onto truck t2 at l2_4
   - Drive t2 to l2_1 (airport)
   - Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1
   - At this point, p1 is in l1_2, satisfying constraint 3

3. Move p1 to l2_3 (to satisfy constraint 5):
   - Load p1 onto truck t1 at l1_2
   - Drive t1 to l1_1 (airport)
   - Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1
   - Load p1 onto airplane a1
   - Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1
   - Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1
   - Load p1 onto truck t2
   - Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_3
   - Unload p1 from t2 at l2_3

4. Move p2 to l1_1 (satisfying constraint 4):
   - Load p2 onto airplane a2 at l2_1
   - Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1
   - Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1
   - At this point, p1 is in l2_3, satisfying constraint 5

5. Move p2 to l1_3:
   - Load p2 onto truck t1 at l1_1
   - Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_3
   - Unload p2 from t1 at l1_3

6. Move p1 to l2_4:
   - Load p1 onto truck t2 at l2_3
   - Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_4
   - Unload p1 from t2 at l2_4
   - At this point, p1 is in l2_4 and p2 is in l1_3, satisfying constraint 1

7. Move p1 back to l2_2 (its goal):
   - Load p1 onto truck t2 at l2_4
   - Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_2
   - Unload p1 from t2 at l2_2

8. Move p2 to l1_5 (its goal):
   - Load p2 onto truck t1 at l1_3
   - Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_5
   - Unload p2 from t1 at l1_5

Wait, I realize I've been making assumptions about the movements of t1 and t2. Let me be more careful. I should ensure that the trucks are where I'm assuming they are. Let me revise the plan again.

Starting state:
- t1 is in l1_2 (city c1)
- t2 is in l2_4 (city c2)
- p1 is in l2_2 (city c2)
- p2 is in l2_4 (city c2)
- a1 is in l1_1 (airport in city c1)
- a2 is in l2_1 (airport in city c2)

1. Move t2 from l2_4 to l2_2:
   - drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2

2. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_2:
   - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

3. Drive t2 to l2_4:
   - drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2

4. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_4:
   - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
   - Now p1 is in l2_4

5. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_4:
   - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

6. Drive t2 to l2_1 (airport):
   - drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2

7. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1:
   - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
   - Now p2 is in l2_1 (satisfying constraint 2)

But wait, according to constraint 3, if p2 is in l2_1, then p1 must be in l1_1 or l1_2. Currently, p1 is in l2_4. I need to move p1 before moving p2 to l2_1.

Let me try another approach:

1. Move t2 from l2_4 to l2_2:
   - drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2

2. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_2:
   - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

3. Drive t2 to l2_1 (airport):
   - drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2

4. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1:
   - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

5. Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1:
   - loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

6. Fly a2 to l1_1:
   - flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

7. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1:
   - unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

8. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_1:
   - Well, t1 is in l1_2, not l1_1. I need to move t1 first.

8a. Move t1 from l1_2 to l1_1:
   - drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1

8b. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_1:
   - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

9. Drive t1 to l1_2:
   - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1

10. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_2:
    - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
    - Now p1 is in l1_2

11. Drive a2 back to l2_1:
    - flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1

12. Return to city c2 to pick up p2:
    - Move t2 to l2_4:
      - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2

13. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_4:
    - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

14. Drive t2 to l2_1 (airport):
    - drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2

15. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1:
    - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
    - Now p2 is in l2_1 (satisfying constraint 2) and p1 is in l1_2 (satisfying constraint 3)

16. Load p2 onto a2 at l2_1:
    - loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

17. Fly a2 to l1_1:
    - flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

18. Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1:
    - unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
    - Now p2 is in l1_1 (satisfying constraint 4)

According to constraint 5, if p2 is in l1_1, then p2 must be in l2_2 or p1 must be in l2_3. Currently, p1 is in l1_2. I need to move p1 to l2_3.

19. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_2:
    - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2

20. Drive t1 to l1_1 (airport):
    - drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1

21. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1:
    - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

22. Load p1 onto a1 at l1_1:
    - loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

23. Fly a1 to l2_1:
    - flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

24. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1:
    - unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

25. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_1 (assuming t2 is still at l2_1):
    - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

26. Drive t2 to l2_3:
    - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2

27. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_3:
    - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
    - Now p1 is in l2_3, satisfying constraint 5 (since p2 is in l1_1)

28. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_1:
    - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

29. Drive t1 to l1_3:
    - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1

30. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_3:
    - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
    - Now p2 is in l1_3

31. Drive t2 to l2_4:
    - drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2

32. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_3:
    - Wait, I made a mistake. I moved t2 away from l2_3. Let me correct:

31. Move t2 from l2_3 to l2_4:
    - drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2

32. Now, I need to move p1 to l2_4. But I just moved t2 away from p1.

Actually, let me restart with a clearer plan:

Starting state:
- t1 is in l1_2 (city c1)
- t2 is in l2_4 (city c2)
- p1 is in l2_2 (city c2)
- p2 is in l2_4 (city c2)
- a1 is in l1_1 (airport in city c1)
- a2 is in l2_1 (airport in city c2)

I need to ensure that:
1. p1 is in l2_4 and p2 is in l1_3 at some point.
2. p2 is in l2_1 at some point, and when it is, p1 is in l1_1 or l1_2.
3. p2 is in l1_1 at some point, and when it is, p2 is in l2_2 or p1 is in l2_3.
4. The final state has p1 in l2_2 and p2 in l1_5.

Let me work backwards from the goal:
- p1 should end up in l2_2 (which is its starting location).
- p2 should end up in l1_5.

To get p2 to l1_5, I can:
- Load p2 onto t1 at l1_3.
- Drive t1 to l1_5.
- Unload p2 from t1 at l1_5.

This means p2 needs to be in l1_3 at some point, which is part of constraint 1. But it also means t1 needs to be in l1_3, and currently, t1 is in l1_2.

I think a logical order would be:
1. Move p1 to l1_1 or l1_2 (to prepare for constraint 2).
2. Move p2 to l2_1 (satisfying constraint 2).
3. Move p1 to l2_3 (to prepare for constraint 5).
4. Move p2 to l1_1 (satisfying constraint 4 and preparing for constraint 5).
5. Move p2 to l1_3 and p1 to l2_4 (satisfying constraint 1).
6. Move p1 back to l2_2 (goal).
7. Move p2 to l1_5 (goal).

Let's implement this plan step by step, being careful about the locations of all objects:

1. Move p1 to l1_2 (to prepare for constraint 2):
   - 1a. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_2: drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2
   - 1b. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_2: loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
   - 1c. Drive t2 to l2_1 (airport): drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
   - 1d. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1: unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
   - 1e. Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1: loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
   - 1f. Fly a2 to l1_1: flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
   - 1g. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1: unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
   - 1h. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_1 (but t1 is in l1_2, so:)
       - 1h-i. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1: drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
       - 1h-ii. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_1: loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
   - 1i. Drive t1 to l1_2: drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
   - 1j. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_2: unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
   Now, p1 is in l1_2.

2. Move p2 to l2_1 (satisfying constraint 2):
   - 2a. Fly a2 back to l2_1: flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
   - 2b. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4: drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
   - 2c. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_4: loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
   - 2d. Drive t2 to l2_1: drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
   - 2e. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1: unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
   Now, p2 is in l2_1 (satisfying constraint 2) and p1 is in l1_2 (satisfying constraint 3).

3. Move p1 to l2_3 (to prepare for constraint 5):
   - 3a. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_2: loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
   - 3b. Drive t1 to l1_1 (airport): drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
   - 3c. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1: unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
   - 3d. Load p1 onto a1 at l1_1: loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
   - 3e. Fly a1 to l2_1: flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
   - 3f. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1: unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
   - 3g. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_1: loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
   - 3h. Drive t2 to l2_3: drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
   - 3i. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_3: unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
   Now, p1 is in l2_3.

4. Move p2 to l1_1 (satisfying constraint 4):
   - 4a. Drive t2 back to l2_1: drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
   - 4b. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_1: loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
   - 4c. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1: unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (redundant, but just to be clear)
   - 4d. Load p2 onto a2 at l2_1: loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
   - 4e. Fly a2 to l1_1: flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
   - 4f. Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1: unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
   Now, p2 is in l1_1 (satisfying constraint 4) and p1 is in l2_3 (satisfying constraint 5).

5. Move p2 to l1_3 (partial satisfaction of constraint 1):
   - 5a. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_1: loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
   - 5b. Drive t1 to l1_3: drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
   - 5c. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_3: unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
   Now, p2 is in l1_3.

6. Move p1 to l2_4 (complete satisfaction of constraint 1):
   - 6a. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_3: drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
   - 6b. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_3: loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
   - 6c. Drive t2 to l2_4: drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
   - 6d. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_4: unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
   Now, p1 is in l2_4 and p2 is in l1_3, satisfying constraint 1.

7. Move p1 back to l2_2 (goal):
   - 7a. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_4: loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
   - 7b. Drive t2 to l2_2: drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2
   - 7c. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_2: unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
   Now, p1 is in l2_2 (achieving goal for p1).

8. Move p2 to l1_5 (goal):
   - 8a. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_3: loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
   - 8b. Drive t1 to l1_5: drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_5 c1
   - 8c. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_5: unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
   Now, p2 is in l1_5 (achieving goal for p2).

Let me double-check this:
- p1 ends in l2_2, its goal location.
- p2 ends in l1_5, its goal location.
- p1 was in l2_4 and p2 was in l1_3 at some point (constraint 1).
- p2 was in l2_1 at some point and p1 was in l1_2 (constraint 2, 3).
- p2 was in l1_1 at some point and p1 was in l2_3 (constraint 4, 5).

Everything looks good. Let me write out the final plan:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
5. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
6. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
7. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
8. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
9. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
10. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
11. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
12. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
13. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
14. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
15. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
16. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
17. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
18. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
19. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
20. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
21. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
22. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
23. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
24. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
25. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
26. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
27. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
28. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
29. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
30. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
31. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
32. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
33. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
34. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
35. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
36. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
37. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
38. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2
39. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
40. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
41. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_5 c1
42. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

Hmm, step 26 seems redundant with step 33. Let me check if there's any redundancy or inefficiency in the plan.

Wait, step 26 is about driving t2 from l2_3 to l2_1, and step 33 is about driving t2 from l2_1 to l2_3. These are not redundant but opposite directions. However, the inefficiency is that I'm making t2 go back and forth. Let me check if I can optimize the plan.

Actually, I see a more direct issue: steps 16 and 27. In step 16, I unload p2 from t2 at l2_1, and then in step 27, I load p2 onto a2 at l2_1. This is fine, but I could load p2 onto a2 directly.

Let me optimize the plan:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

...

Let me rethink this carefully.

Starting state:
- t1 is in l1_2 (city c1)
- t2 is in l2_4 (city c2)
- p1 is in l2_2 (city c2)
- p2 is in l2_4 (city c2)
- a1 is in l1_1 (airport in city c1)
- a2 is in l2_1 (airport in city c2)

For constraint 1, I need p1 in l2_4 and p2 in l1_3 at some point.
For constraint 2, I need p2 in l2_1 at some point.
For constraint 3, if p2 is in l2_1, then p1 must be in l1_1 or l1_2.
For constraint 4, I need p2 in l1_1 at some point.
For constraint 5, if p2 is in l1_1, then p2 must be in l2_2 or p1 must be in l2_3.

Final goal is p1 in l2_2 (its starting position) and p2 in l1_5.

Let's start by addressing constraint 3. I'll move p1 to l1_2 before moving p2 to l2_1.

1. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
5. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
6. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
7. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
8. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
9. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
10. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
11. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
// Now p1 is in l1_2 (preparing for constraint 3)

12. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
13. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
14. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
15. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
16. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
// Now p2 is in l2_1 (satisfying constraint 2) and p1 is in l1_2 (satisfying constraint 3)

Next, I'll address constraints 4 and 5. I'll move p1 to l2_3 and then move p2 to l1_1.

17. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
18. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
19. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
20. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
21. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
22. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
23. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
24. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
25. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
// Now p1 is in l2_3 (preparing for constraint 5)

26. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
27. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
28. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
// Now p2 is in l1_1 (satisfying constraint 4) and p1 is in l2_3 (satisfying constraint 5)

Now, I'll address constraint 1. I'll move p2 to l1_3 and p1 to l2_4.

29. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
30. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
31. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
// Now p2 is in l1_3 (partial satisfaction of constraint 1)

32. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
33. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
// Wait, I made a mistake. I moved t2 to l2_4 before loading p1.

Let me correct. The mistake is here. Let me continue from step 25:

26. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
// Move t2 back to l2_1 to help transport p2
27. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
28. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
29. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
// Now p2 is in l1_1 (satisfying constraint 4) and p1 is in l2_3 (satisfying constraint 5)

30. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
31. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
32. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
// Now p2 is in l1_3 (partial satisfaction of constraint 1)

33. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
// Move t2 back to l2_3 to pick up p1
34. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
35. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
36. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
// Now p1 is in l2_4 and p2 is in l1_3 (satisfying constraint 1)

Finally, I'll move the packages to their goal positions.

37. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
38. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2
39. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
// Now p1 is in l2_2 (achieving goal for p1)

40. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
41. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_5 c1
42. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
// Now p2 is in l1_5 (achieving goal for p2)

The final plan is:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
