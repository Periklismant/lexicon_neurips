Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. Hmm, the goal is to get p1 to l1_5 and p2 to l2_3. The initial state has p1 and p2 both in l2_5. Also, there are various constraints to satisfy. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the initial locations. p1 and p2 are both in l2_5, which is in city c2. The airports are l1_1 in c1 and l2_1 in c2. The trucks are t1 in l1_5 (c1) and t2 in l2_3 (c2). Airplanes a1 is at l1_1 (c1's airport), a2 at l2_1 (c2's airport).

So to move packages between cities, we might need to use airplanes. Let's see. For p1 to get to l1_5 in c1, which is a city c1 location. Since it's in c2 initially, we need to fly it to c1's airport, then use a truck to transport it to l1_5. Similarly, p2 needs to go to l2_3 in c2. Wait, but p2 is already in l2_5. Maybe drive t2 from l2_3 (its current location?) Wait, initial state says "Package t2 is in location l2_3". Wait, wait, the original state says "Package t1 is in location l1_5", "Package t2 is in location l2_3". Oh, wait, those are the trucks. So truck t1 is at l1_5 in c1, and truck t2 is at l2_3 in c2. So trucks can drive within their cities.

So for p2: it's in l2_5 (c2). To get to l2_3. Since truck t2 is in l2_3, we need to drive t2 to l2_5, load p2 into t2, then drive back to l2_3 and unload. But wait, truck t2 is in l2_3 initially. So first, drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_5 (city c2), load p2, then drive back to l2_3. That would work. But let's check the constraints.

Constraints:

1. p1 must be in l2_5 at least once. But p1 starts there. Wait, the initial state has p1 in l2_5. So that condition is already met. Wait, the first constraint says "The following expression must hold in at least one state: Package p1 is in location l2_5". Since p1 starts there, the initial state satisfies this. So that's covered. So no action needed here, as the initial state already meets it.

But wait, the problem states the original state as having p1 in l2_5. So the first constraint is automatically satisfied. So that's okay.

Second constraint: If p1 is in l2_5 at some state s, then in s or after, either p1 is in l2_4 or p2 is in l2_2. Since the initial state s0 has p1 in l2_5, then we need to ensure that either in s0 or after, p1 is in l2_4 or p2 is in l2_2. But since the initial state s0 is before any actions, the condition must hold either in s0 (but p1 is in l2_5, p2 is in l2_5; so neither p1 in l2_4 nor p2 in l2_2), so we need to have at some point after s0, either p1 is moved to l2_4 or p2 is moved to l2_2.

Third constraint: p2 must be in l2_4 at least once.

Fourth constraint: p1 must be in l2_1 at least once.

Fifth constraint: If p1 is in l2_1 in some state s, then in s or after, either p1 is in l2_3 or p2 is in l1_5.

So, the plan must include moving p1 to l2_1 (airport in c2), which would trigger the fifth constraint. Then, after that, either p1 must go to l2_3 (which is in c2) or p2 must go to l1_5 (c1). But the goal requires p2 to be in l2_3 (c2), so moving p2 to l1_5 would conflict with the goal unless we move it back. But since the goal is p2 in l2_3, maybe that's not feasible. So perhaps we need to ensure that after p1 is in l2_1, then p1 goes to l2_3. But how?

Wait, p1 needs to end up in l1_5 (c1). So the path for p1 would be: l2_5 (c2) -> l2_1 (airport in c2) via truck? Or via airplane. Let me think.

Wait, the airports are l2_1 (c2) and l1_1 (c1). So to move p1 from c2 to c1, we need to fly it. So steps for p1:

1. Transport p1 from l2_5 (c2) to l2_1 (c2's airport). Since l2_5 is in c2, and l2_1 is in c2. So maybe drive a truck (t2) from l2_3 to l2_5, load p1 into t2, drive to l2_1, unload. Then load into airplane a2 (since a2 is at l2_1), fly to l1_1 (c1's airport), unload, then use truck t1 (located at l1_5) to drive to l1_1, load p1, drive back to l1_5, unload.

But let's check the constraints.

But also, during this process, we need to handle the constraints.

Constraint 3: p2 must be in l2_4 at least once. So maybe after moving p2 to l2_4, then to l2_3. Wait, but the goal is l2_3. So perhaps drive t2 to l2_5, load p2, drive to l2_4, unload (satisfying constraint 3), then drive to l2_3 and unload again.

But let's outline the steps.

First, handle p2:

- Truck t2 is at l2_3. So drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_5 (city c2). Then load p2 into t2. Then drive t2 to l2_4, unload p2 (this satisfies constraint 3). Then drive to l2_3 and unload again. Wait, but after unloading at l2_4, p2 is there. Then we need to reload it and drive to l2_3. So steps:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2 (truck moves to l2_5)
2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
3. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2
4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (now p2 is in l2_4, meeting constraint 3)
5. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2
6. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (Wait, no. After unloading, p2 is in l2_4. So to move it to l2_3, we need to load it again. But t2 is in l2_4 now. So steps 5 would move the truck to l2_3, but the package is in l2_4. So to get p2 to l2_3, after step 4, we need to load p2 again. But that would require the truck to be in l2_4. Wait, after step 4: t2 is in l2_4. So step 5: loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (p2 is in l2_4, t2 is in l2_4). Then step 6: drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2. Then unload. That would work. But this adds steps. However, the plan needs to be optimal (shortest possible). So maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, after step 4, drive to l2_3 and then load p2? No, because after step4, p2 is in l2_4, and t2 is in l2_4. So to move p2 to l2_3, the steps would be:

After step4: p2 is in l2_4. Truck t2 is in l2_4.

5. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (but p2 is in l2_4, and t2 is in l2_4. So preconditions met.)

6. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2

7. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (so p2 is in l2_3, which is the goal.)

But that adds steps. However, the constraints require p2 to be in l2_4 at least once. So steps 4 would handle that. So this seems necessary.

But wait, the initial state has p2 in l2_5. So initial steps for p2:

1. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_5.

2. Load p2 into t2 at l2_5.

3. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_4 (unload there to satisfy constraint3).

4. Then drive to l2_3 and unload again. But as above.

But for p2's plan:

Actions needed:

- drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2

- loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5

- drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2

- unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (satisfies constraint3)

- loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

- drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2

- unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (achieves goal for p2)

That's 7 actions for p2. But maybe there's a shorter way. But given the constraints, maybe this is necessary.

Now for p1:

p1 starts in l2_5. Need to get to l1_5.

To move between cities, we need airplanes. So steps for p1:

1. Move p1 from l2_5 to l2_1 (c2's airport).

Since l2_5 is in c2, maybe use a truck. But the truck t2 is in l2_3 initially. Wait, but for p1's transportation, perhaps use another truck? Wait, in the initial state, the trucks are t1 (in l1_5, c1) and t2 (in l2_3, c2). So to move p1 from l2_5 (c2) to l2_1 (c2's airport), we can use truck t2. But t2 is in l2_3. So steps:

a. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_5 (but that's part of the p2 plan already). Wait, but if we handle both packages together, maybe we can combine steps.

Alternatively, perhaps using another truck? Wait, the problem statement mentions trucks t1 and t2. So in c2, only truck t2 is available. So to move p1 from l2_5 to l2_1, we need t2 to drive there. But t2 is initially in l2_3. So first, drive t2 to l2_5 (as part of moving p2). Then, after loading p2, maybe use the same truck to move p1.

Wait, but trucks can carry multiple packages. So maybe load both p1 and p2 into t2 when it's at l2_5. But the problem allows loading multiple packages, right? But the problem statement doesn't mention any capacity constraints, so assuming that's allowed.

But the constraints require that after p1 is in l2_1, then either p1 is in l2_3 or p2 is in l1_5. Since the goal is p2 in l2_3, the latter is not part of the goal. So perhaps after moving p1 to l2_1, we need to have p1 go to l2_3 (but that's in c2), but the goal is in c1. Hmm, this seems conflicting. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the constraints.

Let's re-examine constraint5:

If p1 is in l2_1 at any state s, then in s or after, either p1 is in l2_3 or p2 is in l1_5.

So after moving p1 to l2_1 (c2's airport), we need to ensure that at some point after that, either p1 is moved to l2_3 (which is in c2) or p2 is moved to l1_5 (c1). But the goal for p2 is l2_3 in c2. So if we move p2 to l1_5, we have to move it back, but that's more steps. Alternatively, moving p1 to l2_3 (c2) would complicate getting it to c1. So perhaps the plan must include moving p1 to l2_3 after l2_1, but then how to get it to c1?

This seems tricky. Let's think. Suppose we move p1 to l2_1 (airport), then load it onto airplane a2 (which is at l2_1), fly to l1_1 (c1's airport), then unload. Then use truck t1 (in l1_5) to drive to l1_1, load p1, drive back to l1_5, unload. But during this process, after p1 is in l2_1 (when we load it into the airplane), we need to satisfy the fifth constraint: after p1 is in l2_1, either p1 goes to l2_3 or p2 goes to l1_5.

But if we load p1 into airplane a2 at l2_1 and fly to l1_1, then p1 is moved out of l2_1. So the state after loading p1 into the airplane would have p1 in a2, which is still at l2_1 (until the airplane flies). Wait, the fly action would move the airplane from l2_1 to l1_1. So when we load p1 into a2 at l2_1, then fly to l1_1, the unloading would put p1 in l1_1. So after flying, p1 is in l1_1. So in the steps:

After loading p1 into a2 at l2_1, then fly to l1_1, then unload. So after the fly, the airplane is at l1_1, and p1 is in a2. Then unloading at l1_1 would put p1 in l1_1. Then using truck t1 to move it to l1_5.

So the steps for p1:

1. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_5 (c2). Load p1 into t2. Then drive to l2_1, unload p1. Then load into a2. Fly to l1_1. Unload. Then drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_1, load p1, drive to l1_5, unload.

But during this, when p1 is at l2_1 (after being unloaded from the truck), we have to ensure that either p1 is moved to l2_3 or p2 is moved to l1_5. But in this plan, p1 is moved from l2_1 to a2 (loaded into the airplane), which is still at l2_1. Then when the airplane flies to l1_1, p1 is moved to l1_1, not l2_3. So this would not satisfy the fifth constraint. Because after p1 is in l2_1 (after unloading from truck), we need to have either p1 in l2_3 or p2 in l1_5.

But in this plan, after p1 is at l2_1 (state s), the next steps are loading into a2, flying to l1_1. So in state s, p1 is in l2_1. Then, after that, p1 is in a2 (still at l2_1) during loading. Then after flying, p1 is in l1_1. So between s (p1 in l2_1) and the next state, p1 is in a2 (but a2 is in l2_1 until fly). So after loading, p1 is in a2 at l2_1, then fly moves a2 to l1_1, so p1 is in l1_1. So the fifth constraint requires that after s (p1 in l2_1), in s or after, p1 is in l2_3 or p2 is in l1_5. But in the plan, neither happens. So this violates the fifth constraint. Therefore, this plan is invalid.

So how to handle this? We need to ensure that after p1 is in l2_1, either p1 moves to l2_3 (but that's in c2, which is not helpful for the goal) or p2 moves to l1_5 (c1). But the goal for p2 is l2_3, so moving it to l1_5 and back would be extra steps. But maybe necessary.

Alternatively, perhaps during the process of moving p1, we can have p2 temporarily moved to l1_5. Let's think.

Option: After moving p1 to l2_1, we need to have p2 in l1_5. But p2 is in c2. To move p2 to l1_5 (c1), we need to fly it via airplane. But that requires:

- Move p2 to l2_1 (c2's airport), load into airplane, fly to l1_1 (c1's airport), unload, then use truck t1 to drive to l1_1, load, drive to l1_5, unload. Then move p2 back to c2's l2_3. But this is a lot of steps and not optimal. But perhaps necessary due to the constraints.

But this would significantly increase the plan length. So maybe the optimal plan must include this.

Alternatively, after moving p1 to l2_1, can we arrange for p1 to go to l2_3? But then how to get it to c1's l1_5. That's a problem. Because l2_3 is in c2. So if p1 is in l2_3, then to get to c1, we'd have to move it back to l2_1, load into airplane, etc. Which would add steps.

This seems complicated. Let's try to outline a possible plan that meets all constraints.

Let's break down the steps for both packages, considering the constraints.

First, handle p2's constraints:

- Must be in l2_4 at least once.

The plan for p2: move from l2_5 to l2_4 (satisfy constraint3), then to l2_3 (goal). So steps:

1. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_5.

2. Load p2 into t2.

3. Drive to l2_4, unload (now constraint3 is met).

4. Load p2 again, drive to l2_3, unload.

But during these steps, when p2 is unloaded in l2_4, that's one state where constraint3 holds.

Now, for p1:

Initial location: l2_5.

Need to move to l1_5.

Constraints for p1:

- Must be in l2_5 (already satisfied initially).

- After being in l2_5, either p1 is in l2_4 or p2 is in l2_2. But since p1 is initially in l2_5, the constraint is that after the initial state, either p1 moves to l2_4 or p2 moves to l2_2.

But according to the p2 plan above, p2 moves to l2_4 and l2_3. So in the steps for p2, when p2 is moved to l2_4, that's part of the plan. But the constraint for p1's first constraint is already satisfied by the initial state. The second constraint says that if in any state s, p1 is in l2_5, then in s or after, either p1 is in l2_4 or p2 is in l2_2. But since the initial state is the only state where p1 is in l2_5, after that, in subsequent states, we need to have either p1 in l2_4 or p2 in l2_2. But in the current plan for p2, p2 is moved to l2_4. So does that satisfy the second constraint?

Wait, the second constraint is: if in state s, p1 is in l2_5, then in s or after, either p1 in l2_4 or p2 in l2_2.

But the initial state is s0, where p1 is in l2_5. So after s0, in subsequent states, we need to have either p1 in l2_4 or p2 in l2_2. But in our current p2 plan, p2 is moved to l2_4 (which is one of the required options). Wait, the constraint says "At least one of the following conditions is true: 'p1 is in l2_4' OR 'p2 is in l2_2'." So after s0, if p2 is moved to l2_4, that doesn't satisfy the 'p2 in l2_2' part. So that's a problem.

Ah, I see. The second constraint says that if p1 is in l2_5 (which it is in s0), then in s0 or after, either p1 is in l2_4 or p2 is in l2_2. But in the p2 plan, p2 is moved to l2_4, which doesn't satisfy the 'p2 in l2_2' part. So the second constraint requires that after s0, either p1 is moved to l2_4 or p2 is moved to l2_2. Since p1 is in l2_5 initially, and needs to go to l1_5, moving p1 to l2_4 (which is in c2) is not helpful. So perhaps we need to move p2 to l2_2 instead. But how?

So for the second constraint, since p1 starts in l2_5, we need to ensure that after that, either p1 goes to l2_4 or p2 goes to l2_2. But the p2 plan currently moves p2 to l2_4 and then to l2_3. So the second constraint requires p2 to be in l2_2. So we need to adjust the plan.

So maybe the p2 plan needs to first go to l2_2. Let's think.

Alternative p2 plan:

1. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_2 (city c2).

2. Load p2 (but wait, p2 is initially in l2_5. So this is impossible unless we first move t2 to l2_5.

Wait, this is confusing. The initial location of p2 is l2_5. So to load p2 into t2, t2 must be in l2_5. So steps:

1. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_5.

2. Load p2 into t2.

3. Drive to l2_2 (satisfy the second constraint by p2 being in l2_2).

4. Unload p2 in l2_2.

But then, the goal requires p2 to be in l2_3. So after that, need to move p2 from l2_2 to l2_3. But also, the third constraint requires p2 to be in l2_4 at least once. So after step4 (p2 in l2_2), then:

5. Load p2 into t2 at l2_2.

6. Drive to l2_4.

7. Unload (satisfy constraint3).

8. Load again, drive to l2_3, unload.

But this adds more steps. However, this might be necessary to satisfy the constraints.

So the p2 plan would be:

- drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2

- loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5

- drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2

- unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (satisfies second constraint because after initial state s0, p2 is moved to l2_2, satisfying the 'p2 in l2_2' part of the condition triggered by s0 where p1 is in l2_5)

- loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

- drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2

- unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (satisfies third constraint)

- loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

- drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2

- unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (achieve goal)

That's 9 actions for p2. But this seems long. But the constraints require this. So this is necessary.

Now, for p1's plan.

p1 needs to go from l2_5 to l1_5.

Steps:

1. Move p1 from l2_5 to l2_1 (c2's airport).

This requires using truck t2. But during the p2 plan, t2 is moving to l2_5, then l2_2, etc. So we need to coordinate.

Wait, the initial steps for p2 involve driving t2 to l2_5. So perhaps when t2 is in l2_5, we can load both p1 and p2 into t2. But since they are both in l2_5, we can load them in sequence.

But wait, the problem allows loading multiple packages. So after driving t2 to l2_5:

Action1: drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2

Then:

Action2: loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 (p2 is loaded)

Action3: loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (p1 is loaded)

Then drive to l2_2, unload p2, etc. But then p1 is still in t2. Then drive to l2_1 (airport), unload p1, load into airplane a2, fly to l1_1, etc.

But this way, during the p2 plan, p1 is also being moved.

Let's outline this combined plan.

Combined steps:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2 (t2 now in l2_5)

2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 (p2 in t2)

3. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (p1 in t2)

4. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2 (move to l2_2)

5. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (p2 in l2_2; this satisfies the second constraint's 'p2 in l2_2' after s0)

6. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2

7. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (Wait, no. After step5, p2 is in l2_2, and t2 is there. So to load p2 again, need to be in l2_2. Wait, step5: unload p2 in l2_2. Then step6: drive t2 to l2_4. But after step5, t2 is in l2_2. So step6 is driving to l2_4. Then step7: loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4? No, because p2 is in l2_2. So this approach won't work.

Alternatively, after step5 (unload p2 in l2_2), then t2 is in l2_2 with p1 still inside. Then:

6. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2 (p1 is still in t2)

7. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (p1 is now in l2_4; but that's not helpful. We need p1 to go to l2_1.)

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let's think again.

Alternatively, after loading both p1 and p2 into t2 at l2_5, drive t2 to l2_1 (airport) first to unload p1, then proceed with p2's movements.

So steps:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2

2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5

3. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

4. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2

5. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (p1 is now in l2_1; this satisfies the fourth constraint)

But then, after p1 is in l2_1, constraint5 requires that either p1 moves to l2_3 or p2 moves to l1_5. But in this step, p1 is unloaded at l2_1. So we need to handle that.

After step5, p1 is in l2_1. To satisfy constraint5, we need to have either p1 in l2_3 or p2 in l1_5 after this.

But in this plan, after step5, we can proceed to move p1 into airplane a2 at l2_1, fly to l1_1, then to l1_5. But moving p1 to l2_3 would be counterproductive. Alternatively, p2 must be moved to l1_5. But p2 is currently in t2 (which is at l2_1 after step4). But in step5, we unloaded p1. So t2 is at l2_1 with p2 still loaded?

Wait, no. After step3: t2 has both p1 and p2 loaded. Then step4: drive to l2_1. Then step5: unload p1. So p1 is in l2_1, p2 is still in t2. So t2 is at l2_1 with p2 inside.

Then, to handle p2, we can drive t2 back to l2_2, unload p2 there (satisfying the second constraint), but then need to get p2 to l2_3.

But this is getting too tangled. Let's try to structure this properly.

Alternative plan:

For p1:

- Use truck t2 to move p1 from l2_5 to l2_1 (airport).

For this:

1. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_5.

2. Load p1 into t2.

3. Drive to l2_1.

4. Unload p1 at l2_1 (now constraint4 is met: p1 is in l2_1).

Then, to satisfy constraint5: after p1 is in l2_1, either p1 moves to l2_3 or p2 moves to l1_5.

But p1 needs to go to l1_5. So perhaps p1 is loaded into airplane a2 at l2_1 and flown to l1_1. Then, after that, the constraint5 is satisfied by p2 being moved to l1_5. But how?

Alternatively, after moving p1 to l2_1, we can load it into airplane a2 and fly to l1_1. Then unload, then use truck t1 to drive to l1_5. But during this process, after p1 is in l2_1, the next steps involve moving it to l1_1 (so not l2_3). So to satisfy constraint5, we need to have p2 moved to l1_5. So after p1 is in l2_1, we have to arrange for p2 to be in l1_5.

But p2 is in l2_5 initially. To get to l1_5, we need to:

- Move p2 to l2_1 (c2's airport).

- Load into airplane a2, fly to l1_1.

- Unload, load into truck t1, drive to l1_5.

But this would require:

For p2:

5. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2 (after step4, t2 is at l2_1. So drive back to l2_5 to load p2).

6. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5.

7. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2.

8. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.

9. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1.

10. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

11. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1.

12. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1.

13. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

14. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1.

15. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5.

But this is a lot of steps. But the constraint requires that after p1 is in l2_1, p2 is moved to l1_5. But this would take many steps. However, the problem requires an optimal plan, so this seems too long. Is there a way to combine steps?

Alternatively, maybe after moving p1 to l2_1 and loading it into a2, during the same steps, we can also move p2 to l1_5. But this would require more steps.

But let's think again. The fifth constraint says that if p1 is in l2_1 at any state s, then in s or after, either p1 is in l2_3 or p2 is in l1_5. So after moving p1 to l2_1 (step4), we can choose to move p2 to l1_5. But the goal requires p2 to be in l2_3. So after moving p2 to l1_5, we need to move it back to l2_3, which is expensive. But perhaps necessary.

But this would require:

After step4 (p1 in l2_1):

5. Load p1 into a2 at l2_1.

6. Fly a2 to l1_1.

7. Unload p1 in l1_1.

8. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_1.

9. Load p1 into t1.

10. Drive to l1_5.

11. Unload p1 (achieves goal).

Then, for p2:

12. Drive t2 from l2_1 (where it is after step4) to l2_5.

13. Load p2 into t2.

14. Drive to l2_1.

15. Unload p2 into l2_1.

16. Load into a2 (now a2 is at l1_1, so we need to fly it back to l2_1 first? No, after step6, a2 is at l1_1. So to move p2, we need to use another airplane. But a2 is in l1_1 now. The only other airplane is a1, which is in l1_1. So a1 is in c1's airport. So to move p2 from c2 to c1, we need to use a2 again, but it's in c1. So fly a2 back to l2_1, which is possible.

17. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1.

18. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1.

19. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

20. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1.

21. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

22. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1.

23. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 (now p2 is in l1_5, satisfying the fifth constraint).

24. Then, move p2 back to l2_3. To do that:

24. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5.

25. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1.

26. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

27. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1.

28. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1.

29. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1.

30. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2.

31. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.

32. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2.

33. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (achieves goal).

This is clearly not optimal. The plan is way too long, and the problem requires an optimal (shortest) plan. So this approach is not feasible.

Alternative idea: Can we satisfy the fifth constraint by having p1 move to l2_3 after being in l2_1? But p1's goal is in l1_5. So if p1 is moved to l2_3, then we have to move it back to c2's airport and then to c1. This would also add steps.

So perhaps:

After step4 (p1 in l2_1):

5. Load p1 into t2 (but t2 is at l2_1).

6. Drive t2 to l2_3.

7. Unload p1 in l2_3 (satisfies the fifth constraint, as p1 is now in l2_3 after being in l2_1).

Then, proceed to move p1 from l2_3 to l2_1 again, then load into airplane.

But this adds steps:

5. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

6. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2

7. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

Now, p1 is in l2_3. Then:

8. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

9. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

10. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

11. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

12. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

13. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

14. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1

15. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

16. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1

17. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 (goal achieved).

Meanwhile, for p2:

We need to move p2 from l2_5 to l2_3, satisfying the constraints.

But this plan for p1 now includes moving p1 to l2_3, which allows the fifth constraint to be satisfied. But during this, what about p2's movement?

The initial location of p2 is l2_5. To get to l2_3, we need to use truck t2. But t2 is being used to move p1 to l2_3, then back to l2_1, etc. So during this time, when can we move p2?

This is getting very complicated. Let's try to outline the entire plan step by step, considering all constraints and interactions.

Comprehensive Plan Outline:

1. Move p1 from l2_5 to l2_1 (airport) using t2.

   a. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2

   b. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

   c. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2

   d. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

   Now, p1 is in l2_1 (satisfies constraint4).

2. Satisfy constraint5: after p1 is in l2_1, either p1 moves to l2_3 or p2 moves to l1_5.

   Option: Move p1 to l2_3.

   e. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

   f. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2

   g. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

   Now, p1 is in l2_3 (satisfies constraint5).

3. Move p1 back to l2_1 to load into airplane.

   h. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

   i. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

   j. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

4. Fly p1 to c1.

   k. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

   l. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

   m. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

5. Use truck t1 to move p1 to l1_5.

   n. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1

   o. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

   p. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1

   q. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 (achieves p1's goal).

Now, for p2:

Initial location: l2_5.

Need to move to l2_3.

Constraints:

- Must be in l2_4 at least once (constraint3).

- Also, after initial state (s0), since p1 was in l2_5, we need either p1 in l2_4 or p2 in l2_2. But in this plan, p1 is moved to l2_1 and then l2_3, so p1 is not in l2_4. So we need p2 to be in l2_2 at some point.

Thus, steps for p2:

1. After step a (t2 is at l2_5 after step a):

   a. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2 (already done)

   r. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5

2. Drive to l2_2 to satisfy constraint2.

   s. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2

   t. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (satisfies constraint2)

3. Load p2 back into t2.

   u. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

4. Drive to l2_4 to satisfy constraint3.

   v. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2

   w. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (satisfies constraint3)

5. Load p2 and drive to l2_3.

   x. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

   y. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2

   z. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (achieves p2's goal).

But integrating these steps with the p1 plan.

The complete plan would interleave steps for p1 and p2. However, since the trucks and airplanes are shared resources, we need to sequence the steps correctly.

But this is getting very lengthy. Let's see if there's a smarter way.

Alternative Idea: Use the airplane for p2 as well. For example, move p2 to l1_5 to satisfy the fifth constraint when p1 is in l2_1, but then move it back. But this may not be optimal.

Alternatively, find a way to satisfy the constraints with minimal steps.

Let's try to list all the required actions in order:

For p1:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2 (to load p1)

2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

3. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2

4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (constraint4 met)

5. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (to move to l2_3)

6. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2

7. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (constraint5 met)

8. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (to move back to l2_1)

9. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

10. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

11. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

12. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

13. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

14. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1

15. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

16. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1

17. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 (done)

For p2:

- Initial location l2_5. After step1, t2 is at l2_5.

18. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 (after step1)

But after step1, steps for p1 are already using t2. So interleave these:

After step1: t2 is at l2_5.

 step2: load p1 into t2.

 step18: load p2 into t2.

But trucks can carry multiple packages, so both can be loaded.

But the problem's actions are loading one package at a time. So steps would be:

2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

18. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5

Then, drive to l2_1 (step3).

At l2_1, unload p1 (step4), but p2 is still in t2.

Then, after step4, p1 is in l2_1, p2 is in t2 at l2_1.

Then, for p2, need to move to l2_2.

But t2 is at l2_1. So steps for p2:

19. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2

20. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (constraint2 met)

21. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

22. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2

23. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (constraint3 met)

24. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

25. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2

26. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (done)

But this requires inserting these steps after step4.

But during this time, p1 is already in l2_1, and steps5-17 are for moving p1. So the plan would be interleaved:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2

2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

3. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5

4. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2

5. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

6. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2

7. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

8. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

9. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2

10. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

11. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

12. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2

13. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (p2 done)

Then, for p1:

14. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (but t2 is now at l2_3. This is a problem.)

No, after step4, t2 is at l2_1. Steps5-13 are for p2, which use t2 to move to l2_2, etc. So after step4, t2 is at l2_1 with p2 loaded. Then step5: drive to l2_2 (unload p2 there), etc.

Meanwhile, p1 is in l2_1. To move p1 to l2_3 (to satisfy constraint5), we need to use t2 again, but t2 is being used for p2's steps. So this approach may not work.

Alternatively, after step4 (p1 in l2_1), we can load p1 into airplane a2 and fly to l1_1, then use truck t1.

But during this, t2 is used for p2's steps.

So let's try:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2

2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

3. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5

4. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2

5. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (p1 in l2_1)

6. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

7. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

8. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

9. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1

10. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

11. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1

12. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 (p1 done)

Meanwhile, after step5, t2 is at l2_1 with p2 loaded.

13. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2

14. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (satisfies constraint2)

15. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

16. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2

17. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (satisfies constraint3)

18. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

19. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2

20. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (p2 done)

But now, after step5, p1 is in l2_1. The fifth constraint says that after p1 is in l2_1, either p1 moves to l2_3 or p2 moves to l1_5. In this plan, after step5, p1 is loaded into airplane a2 (step6), which is at l2_1. Then, when a2 flies to l1_1, p1 is in l1_1, not l2_3. So the fifth constraint is not satisfied. Thus, this plan is invalid.

Therefore, we need to ensure that after p1 is in l2_1 (step5), either p1 moves to l2_3 or p2 moves to l1_5.

In this plan, p1 moves to l1_1, which doesn't satisfy the fifth constraint. So this approach doesn't work.

Alternative Idea: Use airplane a2 to fly p2 to l1_5 after p1 is in l2_1.

But this would require:

After step5 (p1 in l2_1):

6. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (p2 is in l2_1)

7. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

8. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

9. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

10. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1

11. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

12. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1

13. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 (now p2 is in l1_5, satisfying constraint5)

14. Then, move p2 back to c2's l2_3:

    loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

    drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1

    unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

    loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (a1 is at l1_1)

    flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

    unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

    drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2

    loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

    drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2

    unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3

This is way too long. But it satisfies all constraints. However, the problem requires the optimal plan, so this is not acceptable.

Another Idea: Find a way to have p2 moved to l2_2 during its movement to l2_3, thereby satisfying constraint2.

But the initial plan for p2 was:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2

2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5

3. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2 (unload p2 here)

4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (constraint2 met)

5. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

6. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2 (unload here)

7. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (constraint3 met)

8. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

9. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2

10. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3

Meanwhile, p1's plan would be:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2

2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

3. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2

4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (constraint4)

5. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

6. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

7. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

8. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1

9. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

10. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1

11. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5

But this plan for p1 requires t2 to be used for p2's steps. So the total steps would need to be interleaved.

But again, after p1 is in l2_1 (step4), the fifth constraint requires that either p1 is moved to l2_3 or p2 is moved to l1_5. In this plan, p1 is moved to l1_1, so neither happens. Thus, the fifth constraint is violated.

So this is not a valid plan.

Final Idea: To satisfy the fifth constraint, after p1 is in l2_1 (step4), we can move p2 to l1_5.

But this requires a lot of steps, but perhaps it's the only way.

So after step4 (p1 in l2_1):

5. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (since p2 was loaded with p1 in step3)

6. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

7. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

8. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

9. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1

10. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

11. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1

12. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 (constraint5 satisfied)

Then, move p2 back to c2's l2_3:

13. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

14. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1

15. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

16. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

17. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

18. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

19. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2

20. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

21. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2

22. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (goal achieved)

Meanwhile, for p1 after step4:

23. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (but a2 is now at l1_1 after step7. So this is not possible.)

This is getting too complicated and the steps are not feasible due to airplane locations.

Thus, after struggling with the constraints, perhaps the correct approach is to use the following plan:

1. Drive t2 to l2_5 and load both p1 and p2.

2. Drive to l2_2 and unload p2 (satisfy constraint2).

3. Drive to l2_1 and unload p1 (satisfy constraint4).

4. Load p1 into a2 and fly to l1_1.

5. Use t1 to move p1 to l1_5.

6. Drive t2 back to l2_2, load p2, drive to l2_4 (satisfy constraint3), then to l2_3.

7. Additionally, after p1 is in l2_1, ensure p2 is moved to l1_5 (which requires flying, but this conflicts with p2's goal).

Given the time constraints and the complexity, I think the optimal plan involves moving p2 to l2_2 and l2_4, and p1 to l2_1 and then using the airplane, ensuring all constraints are met.
