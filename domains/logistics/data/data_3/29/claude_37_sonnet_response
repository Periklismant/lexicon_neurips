Let me first analyze the problem:

We have a logistics domain with cities, locations within cities, trucks, airplanes, and packages. Trucks can move between locations in a city, and airplanes can move between airports. Both trucks and airplanes can carry packages.

The initial state is:
- Locations l1_1, l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5 are in city c1
- Locations l2_1, l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5 are in city c2
- l1_1 and l2_1 are airports
- Package t1 is in location l1_5
- Package t2 is in location l2_3
- Package p1 is in location l2_5
- Package p2 is in location l2_5
- Package a1 is in location l1_1
- Package a2 is in location l2_1

Wait, there's something wrong here. t1, t2, a1, and a2 should be trucks and airplanes, not packages. I think the correct initial state should be:
- Locations l1_1, l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5 are in city c1
- Locations l2_1, l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5 are in city c2
- l1_1 and l2_1 are airports
- Truck t1 is in location l1_5
- Truck t2 is in location l2_3
- Package p1 is in location l2_5
- Package p2 is in location l2_5
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

The goal is:
- Package p1 is in location l1_5
- Package p2 is in location l2_3

There are also constraints:
1. p1 must be in l2_5 at some point (but it already starts there, so this is automatically satisfied)
2. If p1 is in l2_5, then p1 must be in l2_4 OR p2 must be in l2_2 at that time or later
3. p2 must be in l2_4 at some point
4. p1 must be in l2_1 at some point
5. If p1 is in l2_1, then p1 must be in l2_3 OR p2 must be in l1_5 at that time or later

Let's think about what needs to happen to accomplish the goal:

For package p1:
- It starts at l2_5 (in city c2)
- It needs to end up at l1_5 (in city c1)
- It must visit l2_4 or p2 must visit l2_2 (to satisfy constraint 2)
- It must visit l2_1 (to satisfy constraint 4)
- It must visit l2_3 or p2 must visit l1_5 (to satisfy constraint 5)

For package p2:
- It starts at l2_5 (in city c2)
- It needs to end up at l2_3 (in city c2)
- It must visit l2_4 (to satisfy constraint 3)

Now, to move packages, we need to use trucks within cities and airplanes between cities.

Let's sketch a plan for p1:
1. Load p1 onto t2 (which is at l2_3)
   - But t2 is at l2_3 and p1 is at l2_5, so we need to move t2 to l2_5 first
2. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_4 (satisfying the requirement that p1 visits l2_4)
3. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_3 (satisfying the requirement that p1 visits l2_3)
4. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1 (which is the airport, satisfying the requirement that p1 visits l2_1)
5. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1
6. Load p1 onto a2 (which is at l2_1)
7. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1 (the airport in city c1)
8. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1
9. Load p1 onto t1
   - But t1 is at l1_5 and p1 is at l1_1, so we need to move t1 to l1_1 first
10. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_5
11. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_5

And a plan for p2:
1. Load p2 onto t2
   - But t2 is at l2_3 and p2 is at l2_5, so we need to move t2 to l2_5 first
2. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_4 (satisfying the requirement that p2 visits l2_4)
3. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_3
4. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_3

Wait, this logic actually doesn't work because we can't be in two places at once. Let me rethink the plan...

Actually, let's consider p1 and p2 together, since they start at the same location:

1. Move t2 from l2_3 to l2_5
2. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_5
3. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_5
4. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_4 (both p1 and p2 visit l2_4, satisfying constraints 2 and 3)
5. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_3 (p1 visits l2_3, satisfying part of constraint 5)
6. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_3 (achieving final goal position for p2)
7. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1 (p1 visits l2_1, satisfying constraint 4)
8. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1 (making p1 visit l2_1)
9. Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1
10. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1
11. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1
12. Move t1 from l1_5 to l1_1
13. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_1
14. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_5
15. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_5 (achieving final goal position for p1)

Actually, let me try to avoid some unnecessary steps. Let me reconsider our constraints again:

1. p1 must be in l2_5 at some point (but it already starts there, so this is automatically satisfied).
2. If p1 is in l2_5, then p1 must be in l2_4 OR p2 must be in l2_2 at that time or later.
3. p2 must be in l2_4 at some point.
4. p1 must be in l2_1 at some point.
5. If p1 is in l2_1, then p1 must be in l2_3 OR p2 must be in l1_5 at that time or later.

We're starting with p1 and p2 both at l2_5. Because of constraint 2, either p1 must visit l2_4 or p2 must visit l2_2. Since p2 needs to visit l2_4 anyway (constraint 3), let's have both of them move from l2_5 to l2_4 together.

In our plan, we've already decided that p1 will visit l2_3 (satisfying part of constraint 5), and p2 will end up at l2_3. We could alternatively satisfy constraint 5 by having p2 visit l1_5, but that would involve moving p2 to another city and then back, which seems inefficient.

So, our plan is:

1. Move t2 from l2_3 to l2_5
2. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_5
3. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_5
4. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_4 (both p1 and p2 visit l2_4, satisfying constraints 2 and 3)
5. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_3 (p1 visits l2_3, satisfying part of constraint 5)
6. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_3 (achieving final goal position for p2)
7. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1 (p1 visits l2_1, satisfying constraint 4)
8. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1
9. Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1
10. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1
11. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1
12. Move t1 from l1_5 to l1_1
13. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_1
14. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_5
15. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_5 (achieving final goal position for p1)

Now, let's convert this plan into the specific action format given:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
3. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
4. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2
5. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2
6. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
7. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
8. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
9. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
10. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
11. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
12. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
13. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
14. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
15. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5

Wait, there's a problem! I said:
9. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
But the action given is "loadairplane p ap l", which loads a package onto an airplane. However, the effect of loading (according to the problem) is "After loading a package p in an airplane ap at location l, (i) p is no longer situated in l, and (ii) p is in ap."

Let me double-check all the actions to ensure they're consistent with the given definitions.

The actions provided are:
- "loadtruck p t l": Load package p in truck t. Both p and t are in location l.
- "loadairplane p ap l": Load package p in airplane ap. Both p and ap are in location l.
- "unloadtruck p t l": Unload package p from truck t in location l.
- "loadairplane p ap l": Unload package p from airplane ap in location l. (This seems to be a typo, should be "unloadairplane")
- "drivetruck t l_from l_to c": Drive truck t from location l_from to location l_to in city c.
- "flyairplane ap l_from l_to": Fly airplane ap from location l_from to location l_to.

There's a typo in the fourth action, which should be "unloadairplane" instead of another "loadairplane". Assuming this correction, let's check our plan again:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
3. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
4. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2
5. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2
6. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
7. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
8. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
9. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
10. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
11. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
12. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
13. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
14. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
15. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5

This seems correct. Each action follows the prescribed format and matches the preconditions.

Wait, let me review the contraints more carefully again:

1. p1 must be in l2_5 at some point (but it already starts there, so this is automatically satisfied).
2. If p1 is in l2_5, then p1 must be in l2_4 OR p2 must be in l2_2 at that time or later.
3. p2 must be in l2_4 at some point.
4. p1 must be in l2_1 at some point.
5. If p1 is in l2_1, then p1 must be in l2_3 OR p2 must be in l1_5 at that time or later.

By the second constraint, I think we need to ensure that once p1 is in l2_5 (which it is initially), either p1 must visit l2_4 or p2 must visit l2_2 at some point afterward. We have p1 and p2 both visiting l2_4, which satisfies this constraint.

By the fifth constraint, once p1 is in l2_1, either p1 must visit l2_3 or p2 must visit l1_5 afterward. In our plan, p1 has already visited l2_3 (in step 5) before it arrives at l2_1 (in step 7), which might not satisfy the constraint. We need to be careful about the ordering.

Let's revise our plan to make sure we satisfy all constraints:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
3. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
4. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2 (both p1 and p2 visit l2_4, satisfying constraints 2 and 3)
5. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2 (p1 visits l2_1, satisfying constraint 4)
6. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2 (p1 visits l2_3 after visiting l2_1, satisfying constraint 5)
7. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (achieving final goal position for p2)
8. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
9. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
10. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
11. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
12. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
13. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
14. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
15. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
16. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 (achieving final goal position for p1)

Actually, now that I review it, in our original plan, p1 does visit l2_3 in step 5, which is before it visits l2_1 in step 7. So, after we unload p1 at l2_1, constraint 5 is already satisfied. The original plan is valid:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
3. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
4. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2
5. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2
6. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
7. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
8. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
9. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
10. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
11. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
12. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
13. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
14. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
15. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5

Wait, let me clarify the second constraint again:
"If expression 'Package p1 is in location l2_5' holds in some state s, then expression 'At least one of the following conditions is true: Package p1 is in location l2_4, Package p2 is in location l2_2' must hold at s or at some state after s"

This means that if p1 is at l2_5, then either p1 must be at l2_4 or p2 must be at l2_2 at that time or later. The key here is that we get to choose which of p1 or p2 visits the respective locations.

And the fifth constraint similarly says:
"If expression 'Package p1 is in location l2_1' holds in some state s, then expression 'At least one of the following conditions is true: Package p1 is in location l2_3, Package p2 is in location l1_5' must hold at s or at some state after s"

So, if p1 is at l2_1, then either p1 must be at l2_3 or p2 must be at l1_5 at that time or later.

Our plan has p1 visiting l2_4 and p1 visiting l2_3 to satisfy these constraints. Let's make sure the order of operations ensures this.

Given our order, p1 is initially at l2_5 (satisfying the first part of constraint 2), and later (in step 4) p1 visits l2_4 (satisfying the second part of constraint 2). So constraint an 2 is satisfied. 

Similarly, p1 visits l2_1 in step 7, and p1 has already visited l2_3 in step 5. Does this satisfy constraint 5? The constraint says once p1 is at l2_1, then either p1 should be at l2_3 or p2 should be at l1_5 at that time or later. But, in our plan, p1 visited l2_3 before visiting l2_1, not at or after.

I see the issue now. It seems like the constraint requires p1 to visit l2_3 after it visits l2_1, not before. To be extra careful, let's revise the path to visit l2_3 after l2_1:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
3. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
4. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2 (satisfying constraint 3 for p2 and part of constraint 2 for p1)
5. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2 (satisfying constraint 4 for p1)
6. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2 (satisfying constraint 5 for p1, as p1 visits l2_3 after l2_1)
7. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (achieving final goal position for p2)
8. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
9. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
10. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
11. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
12. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
13. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
14. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
15. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
16. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
17. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
18. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 (achieving final goal position for p1)

Wait, steps 8 and 9 are unnecessary; p1 is already on the truck. Let's remove those:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
3. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
4. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2 (satisfying constraint 3 for p2 and part of constraint 2 for p1)
5. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2 (satisfying constraint 4 for p1)
6. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2 (satisfying constraint 5 for p1, as p1 visits l2_3 after l2_1)
7. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (achieving final goal position for p2)
8. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
9. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
10. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
11. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
12. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
13. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
14. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
15. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
16. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 (achieving final goal position for p1)

Wait, I'm rereading the fifth constraint:
"If expression 'Package p1 is in location l2_1' holds in some state s, then expression 'At least one of the following conditions is true: Package p1 is in location l2_3, Package p2 is in location l1_5' must hold at s or at some state after s"

It says "at s or at some state after s", which means the condition must hold at the same time or after p1 is at l2_1. 

In step 5, p1 (on t2) is at l2_1. After that, in step 6, p1 (still on t2) moves to l2_3, satisfying the condition. So, the fifth constraint is satisfied by our revised plan.

Let's finalize our plan:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
3. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
4. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2 (satisfying constraint 3 for p2 and part of constraint 2 for p1)
5. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2 (satisfying constraint 4 for p1)
6. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2 (satisfying constraint 5 for p1, as p1 visits l2_3 after l2_1)
7. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (achieving final goal position for p2)
8. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
9. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
10. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
11. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
12. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
13. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
14. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
15. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
16. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 (achieving final goal position for p1)

Actually, I realize there's another potential issue. The given text says "Package t1 is in location l1_5", "Package t2 is in location l2_3", "Package a1 is in location l1_1", and "Package a2 is in location l2_1". But t1 and t2 should be trucks, and a1 and a2 should be airplanes.

Let's assume the correct initial state is:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_5
- Truck t2 is in location l2_3
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1
- Package p1 is in location l2_5
- Package p2 is in location l2_5

Based on this, our plan should be fine. Let's proceed:

```
drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2
drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
```

Actually, I now realize a more optimal plan is possible. Instead of taking p1 back to l2_1 and then to l1_1, we can directly use a different airplane (a1, which is already at l1_1) to pick up p1 at l1_1.

Let's reduce some steps:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
3. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
4. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2
5. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
6. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
7. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
8. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
9. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
10. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
11. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
12. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
13. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1  (Oops, t1 is at l1_5, not l1_1. We need to move it first.)
14. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1 (Wait, we're not leveraging a1 here. Let's rethink.)

Actually, let's stick with the original plan:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
3. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
4. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2
5. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
6. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
7. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
8. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
9. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
10. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
11. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
12. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
13. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
14. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
15. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
16. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5

But let's see if we can optimize further. Do we need to move t2 back to l2_1 after unloading p2 at l2_3?

OK, I previously misunderstood the constraints. Let me review them one more time.

1. p1 must be in l2_5 at some point (already satisfied as it starts there).
2. If p1 is in l2_5, then p1 must be in l2_4 OR p2 must be in l2_2 at some point afterward.
   - p1 is initially at l2_5.
   - After that, our plan has p1 (on t2) visiting l2_4 in step 4, satisfying the constraint.
3. p2 must be in l2_4 at some point.
   - Our plan has p2 (on t2) visiting l2_4 in step 4, satisfying the constraint.
4. p1 must be in l2_1 at some point.
   - Our plan has p1 (on t2) visiting l2_1 in step 5, satisfying the constraint.
5. If p1 is in l2_1, then p1 must be in l2_3 OR p2 must be in l1_5 at some point afterward.
   - p1 is at l2_1 in step 5.
   - After that, our plan has p1 (on t2) visiting l2_3 in step 6, satisfying the constraint.

The constraints are satisfied by our plan.

The main objective of the problem is to get p1 to l1_5 and p2 to l2_3. Our plan achieves this in the the following way:
- p1 initially at l2_5 (city c2) → ends up at l1_5 (city c1)
- p2 initially at l2_5 (city c2) → ends up at l2_3 (city c2)

I'm satisfied with our plan:

```
drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2
drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
```

Actually, after more reflection, I think the unloadairplane and loadairplane actions were swapped in the problem description. It was probably intended as:

- "loadtruck p t l": Load package p in truck t. Both p and t are in location l.
- "loadairplane p ap l": Load package p in airplane ap. Both p and ap are in location l.
- "unloadtruck p t l": Unload package p from truck t in location l.
- "unloadairplane p ap l": Unload package p from airplane ap in location l.
- "drivetruck t l_from l_to c": Drive truck t from location l_from to location l_to in city c.
- "flyairplane ap l_from l_to": Fly airplane ap from location l_from to location l_to.

Assuming this correction, our plan seems fine. Let's revisit and further optimize our plan:

I think this plan is optimal and satisfies all the given constraints. Let's finalize it.

2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
3. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
4. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2

14. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
15. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
16. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5

Actually, let me check if I can reduce the plan further. It looks like constraint 5 requires p1 to visit l2_3 after visiting l2_1. But in our plan, we also visit l2_3 with p1 on the truck in step 6, then go back to l2_1 in step 8. Is that extra step necessary?

Reviewing the constraints once more:

5. If p1 is in l2_1, then p1 must be in l2_3 OR p2 must be in l1_5 at some state after s.

So, after p1 is at l2_1, either p1 must visit l2_3 or p2 must visit l1_5. Since p1 is at l2_1 in step 5, and then p1 (on t2) visits l2_3 in step 6, this fulfills the constraint.

I'm considering if we even need step 8 (going back to l2_1). The purpose of that step is to unload p1 at an airport to then load it onto an airplane. But once p1 is at l2_3, do we need to go back to l2_1? Could we unload p1 at l2_3 and then move it to l1_5 directly?

Actually, since we need to transport p1 from city c2 to city c1, we need to use an airplane, which means we must be at an airport. The given airports are l1_1 (in city c1) and l2_1 (in city c2). So, to transport p1 from city c2 to city c1, p1 must be at airport l2_1 to board an airplane, and then disembark at airport l1_1. Hence, we do need steps 8 and 9.

In summary, our plan:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
3. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
4. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2
5. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
6. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
7. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
8. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
9. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
10. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
11. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
12. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
13. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
14. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
15. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
16. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
