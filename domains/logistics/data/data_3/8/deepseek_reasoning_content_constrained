Okay, let's see. I need to figure out a plan to get package p1 to l1_4 and p2 to l2_3, while satisfying all the constraints. The constraints are a bit tricky, so I need to make sure each one is met. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, the initial state. Packages: p1 is in l2_2 (city c2), p2 is in l2_3 (city c2). Trucks t1 is in l1_4 (city c1), t2 is in l2_4 (city c2). Airplanes a1 is in l1_1 (airport in c1), a2 is in l2_1 (airport in c2). 

The goal is p1 in l1_4 and p2 in l2_3. Wait, but p2 is already in l2_3, right? The initial state says p2 is in l2_3. So maybe the goal for p2 is already satisfied. Wait, no, the problem statement says the final goal is both conditions: p1 in l1_4 and p2 in l2_3. But since p2 is already there, maybe the plan just needs to ensure that it's still there. But maybe during the plan, p2 might get moved and needs to be put back. Hmm, but let me check the initial state again.

Original state says: "Package p1 is in location l2_2", "Package p2 is in location l2_3". So p2 is already at l2_3. So the goal for p2 is already met. Wait, but maybe the problem is that the constraints might require moving p2 and then bringing it back. Wait, the constraints need to be satisfied in the plan's intermediate states.

Looking at the constraints:

1. The first constraint is that "Package p1 is in location l1_1" must hold in at least one state. So during the plan, p1 must be at l1_1 at some point.

2. If p1 is in l1_1 in some state, then there must be an earlier state where p2 is in l2_1.

3. "Package p1 is in location l2_1" must hold in at least one state.

4. If p1 is in l2_1 in some state, then there must be an earlier state where either p2 is in l2_5 or p1 is in l2_3.

5. "Package p2 is in location l2_1" must hold in at least one state.

So let's list out all the required intermediate states:

- p1 must be in l1_1 at some point.

- Before that, p2 must be in l2_1.

- p1 must be in l2_1 at some point.

- Before that, either p2 is in l2_5 or p1 is in l2_3.

- p2 must be in l2_1 at some point.

So the plan must include steps that move p1 to l1_1 and l2_1, and p2 to l2_1, while also ensuring that when p1 is in l2_1, either p2 was in l2_5 or p1 was in l2_3 before.

But p1 starts in l2_2. To get p1 to l1_4 (the goal), which is in city c1. Since trucks can only move within a city, and airplanes can move between airports. So moving between cities requires airplanes.

So for p1 to get from c2 to c1, we need to use an airplane. Let's think: p1 is in l2_2 (c2). Maybe load it into a truck in c2, drive to the airport l2_1, load into airplane a2 (since a2 is at l2_1 initially), fly to l1_1, then unload into a truck in c1, drive to l1_4.

But we also have constraints that require p1 to be in l1_1 and l2_1 at some points.

Wait, the first constraint is that p1 must be in l1_1. So that's part of the plan. The third constraint says p1 must be in l2_1. So p1 has to be in both l1_1 and l2_1 at different times.

But how? Because to get p1 from l2_2 to l1_4, the usual path would be: truck in c2 to move p1 to l2_1 (airport), load into airplane a2, fly to l1_1, unload into truck t1, drive to l1_4. That would involve p1 being in l2_1 (when loaded into airplane) and l1_1 (when unloaded). But maybe the order of these steps can satisfy the constraints.

Wait, the first constraint requires p1 to be in l1_1 at least once, which would naturally happen when the airplane arrives there. The third constraint requires p1 to be in l2_1 at some point. But when loading p1 into the airplane at l2_1, that would mean p1 is in l2_1 (since the airplane is there). Wait, but when you load p1 into the airplane at l2_1, the package is in the airplane, so the location of the package is the airplane's location. So when the airplane is at l2_1, and p1 is loaded, then p1 is in the airplane which is at l2_1. So the state would have p1 in l2_1 (because the airplane is there). Then, when the airplane flies to l1_1, p1 would be in l1_1. So that would satisfy the first constraint (p1 in l1_1) and the third constraint (p1 in l2_1). 

But then, the second constraint says if p1 is in l1_1, then there must be an earlier state where p2 is in l2_1. So before p1 is in l1_1, p2 must be in l2_1 at some point. How can we do that? Because p2 starts in l2_3. So we need to move p2 to l2_1. But the fifth constraint requires p2 to be in l2_1 at some state, so moving it there would satisfy that. Then, when we move p2 to l2_1, that satisfies the fifth constraint, and also allows the second constraint (since p1 is in l1_1 after p2 is in l2_1).

Additionally, the fourth constraint says that if p1 is in l2_1, then there must be an earlier state where either p2 is in l2_5 or p1 is in l2_3. But p1 starts in l2_2, so to have p1 in l2_3, we'd need to move it there. But the goal is to have p1 in l1_4, so maybe that's a detour. Alternatively, moving p2 to l2_5. But p2's goal is l2_3, which is already where it is. Wait, but maybe during the plan, p2 is moved to l2_5 and then back to l2_3. But that would complicate things. Alternatively, if we can have p1 pass through l2_3 before being in l2_1, then that would satisfy the fourth constraint. Let's see.

But p1 is initially in l2_2. If we move p1 to l2_3, then load it into a truck, drive to l2_1. But how? Let's see.

Alternatively, maybe we can first handle p2's movement. Since p2 needs to be in l2_1 at some point (constraint 5), and after that, when p1 is in l1_1 (after being flown there), the second constraint is satisfied. Also, when p1 is loaded into the airplane at l2_1 (thus being in l2_1 in that state), we need to have either p2 in l2_5 or p1 in l2_3 earlier.

So here's a possible approach:

1. Move p2 from l2_3 to l2_1 (satisfying constraint 5).

2. Then move p1 from l2_2 to l2_3 (so that when p1 is later in l2_1, the condition of p1 being in l2_3 before is met).

3. Then move p1 from l2_3 to l2_1 (so p1 is in l2_1, satisfying constraint 3). Then, since p1 was in l2_3 earlier, constraint 4 is satisfied.

4. Load p1 into airplane a2 at l2_1, fly to l1_1 (so p1 is in l1_1, satisfying constraint 1). Since p2 was in l2_1 earlier (step 1), constraint 2 is satisfied.

5. Then, unload p1 from the airplane into l1_1, load into truck t1 (if t1 is at l1_1? Wait, t1's initial location is l1_4. So maybe need to drive t1 to l1_1 first. Then drive t1 back to l1_4 to deliver p1.

But wait, initial locations: t1 is in l1_4 (city c1). So to load p1 into t1, we need t1 to be at the same location as p1, which after flying to l1_1 is there. So steps:

After flying a2 to l1_1 with p1:

- unload p1 from a2 into l1_1.

- drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1 (since t1 is initially in l1_4, in city c1, which includes l1_1).

- load p1 into t1.

- drive t1 back to l1_4.

- unload p1 into l1_4, which is the goal.

But during this process, p2 was moved to l2_1 and then perhaps needs to stay there? But p2's goal is l2_3. Wait, no: the goal is p2 in l2_3, which is already true initially. Wait, the initial state says p2 is in l2_3. So unless the plan moves it elsewhere and needs to put it back. But the problem statement's goal is to have p2 in l2_3, which is already satisfied. However, the constraints require that during the plan, p2 is in l2_1. So moving p2 to l2_1 and then back to l2_3 might be necessary. But that would add steps. Let's check.

Wait, the goal is that in the end, p2 is in l2_3. But since it's already there, perhaps we don't need to move it. But the constraints require that p2 is in l2_1 at some point. So to satisfy constraint 5, we need to move p2 to l2_1 and then maybe leave it there, which would conflict with the goal. Wait, no. Because the constraints are about intermediate states, not the final state. The final state just needs to have p2 in l2_3, but during the plan, p2 must be in l2_1 at some point. So perhaps we can move p2 to l2_1 (satisfying constraint 5), then move it back to l2_3 (so the final state is correct). But how?

So let's outline steps:

For p2:

- Initially in l2_3.

- Need to get to l2_1 (to satisfy constraint 5).

- Then, need to return to l2_3 to meet the goal.

But how to move p2? Since it's in city c2. The truck t2 is in l2_4. So perhaps:

1. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_3 (to pick up p2).

2. Load p2 into t2 at l2_3.

3. Drive t2 to l2_1.

4. Unload p2 into l2_1 (now constraint 5 is met).

5. Then, load p2 into truck t2 again (assuming t2 is at l2_1 now).

6. Drive t2 back to l2_3.

7. Unload p2 into l2_3 (so it's back to the original location, which is the goal).

But this would add steps. However, since the goal requires p2 to be in l2_3, and it's already there, perhaps the plan must not move it. But the constraints require that p2 is in l2_1 at some state, which would require moving it. So even though the initial and final positions are the same, we have to move it and then return it. But maybe there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, perhaps when moving p2 to l2_1, we can do it in a way that allows it to be unloaded there, then reloaded and moved back. But that would take time. Let's see.

But let's think of the order of operations. Maybe moving p2 to l2_1 first, then handling p1.

But let's structure the plan step by step, considering all constraints.

Let me outline the plan in steps, considering all constraints and objects:

First, handle p2's movement to satisfy constraints 5 and 2.

1. Move p2 from l2_3 to l2_1.

   - How? Use truck t2. Since t2 is in l2_4 (city c2). So drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_3 (drive action), load p2 into t2, drive to l2_1, unload p2 there.

   Steps:

   a. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2

   b. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3

   c. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

   d. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

   Now p2 is in l2_1 (satisfies constraint 5). 

But after this, we need to move p2 back to l2_3. But the goal is p2 in l2_3. So perhaps:

   e. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

   f. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2

   g. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3

But this adds several steps. However, since the goal requires p2 to be in l2_3, and it's initially there, maybe the constraints don't require moving it back, but the problem states that the final goal must have p2 in l2_3. So if during the plan we move it to l2_1, then we must move it back. So steps a to g are necessary for p2.

But this seems like a lot of steps. Let's see if there's a better way.

Alternatively, perhaps we can load p2 into an airplane and move it, but since airplanes are for inter-city transport, but l2_1 is in c2. But airplanes can fly between any airports. Wait, l2_1 is an airport in c2. If we fly an airplane from l2_1 to another airport, but maybe that's not needed here. Since moving within c2 can be done with trucks.

So steps a to g are needed for p2 to be moved to l2_1 and back. But that's 7 actions. But maybe there's a way to combine steps.

Alternatively, perhaps when handling p1's movement, we can also move p2. Let me think.

Now, for p1:

Initially in l2_2 (c2). Need to get to l1_4 (c1). So requires using an airplane. So steps:

- Drive a truck (t2) to l2_2, load p1, drive to l2_1 (airport), load into airplane a2, fly to l1_1 (c1's airport), unload, load into truck t1 (drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1), then drive back to l1_4.

But t1 is initially in l1_4. So to load p1 into t1, t1 must be at l1_1. So steps for t1:

- drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1

Then load p1 into t1, then drive back.

So putting this together:

For p1:

h. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2 (Wait, t2 is initially in l2_4, after moving to l2_3 and l2_1, etc. But if we handle p2 first, t2 is busy. Alternatively, maybe use a different truck for p1? Wait, the objects are trucks t1 and t2. t1 is in c1, t2 in c2. So for p1 in c2, must use t2.

Wait, p1 is in l2_2 (c2). So to move p1, we need to use truck t2 (since it's in c2). But initially, t2 is in l2_4. So steps:

To pick up p1:

i. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2

j. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

k. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2

l. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

Now p1 is in l2_1 (satisfies constraint 3). But according to constraint 4, when p1 is in l2_1, there must be an earlier state where p2 is in l2_5 or p1 is in l2_3. So in this case, before p1 is in l2_1 (step l), we need to have either p2 in l2_5 or p1 in l2_3.

But in this scenario, p1 was moved from l2_2 to l2_1 via truck. So unless we route p1 through l2_3, which is possible. For example:

Alternative steps for p1:

i. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2 (t2 was at l2_4, then drive to l2_3)

j. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (this is part of moving p2 to l2_1)

Wait, no. We need to separate the steps for p1 and p2.

Alternatively, maybe after moving p2 to l2_1 (step d above), p1 is moved to l2_3 first, then to l2_1.

But how? Let's think.

Suppose after step d (p2 is in l2_1), we need to move p1 to l2_3. Because p1 starts in l2_2. So:

m. drivetruck t2 (which is at l2_1 after step d) to l2_3.

But wait, after step d, t2 is at l2_1. So:

m. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2

n. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (but p1 is in l2_2. Wait, how can we load p1 into t2 at l2_3 if p1 is in l2_2? That's impossible. So we need to first move p1 to l2_3.

Alternatively, use another truck? But t2 is the only truck in c2. So maybe:

Wait, initial state: p1 is in l2_2. To move p1 to l2_3, we need a truck in l2_2. But t2 is initially in l2_4. So:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2

2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2

4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (now p1 is in l2_3, which satisfies the condition for constraint 4 if p1 is later moved to l2_1)

Then, drive t2 to l2_1:

5. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

6. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (now p1 is in l2_1, satisfying constraint 3). Since p1 was in l2_3 earlier, constraint 4 is satisfied.

But this adds steps. Let's see if this can be integrated.

But considering all constraints, this might be necessary.

So combining the steps for p1 and p2:

For p2:

a. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2 (t2 goes to p2's initial location)

b. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3

c. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

d. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (p2 in l2_1, constraint 5 satisfied)

For p1:

e. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2 (Wait, after step d, t2 is in l2_1. To pick up p1 in l2_2, drive to l2_2.

e. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2

f. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

g. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2

h. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (now p1 is in l2_3)

i. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

j. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

k. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (now p1 is in l2_1 again, but this seems redundant. Wait, maybe after step h, p1 is in l2_3. Then, we need to move p1 to l2_1. So steps i: drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1, then load p1 (but p1 is in l2_3, not in the truck. So perhaps after step h, p1 is in l2_3. Then, we need to load it into t2 again:

i. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (but t2 is at l2_3 after step h)

Wait, after step h, t2 is at l2_3, and p1 is in l2_3. So:

i. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

j. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

k. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (now p1 is in l2_1)

This would mean that p1 is in l2_1 (satisfying constraint 3) and before that, p1 was in l2_3 (step h), satisfying constraint 4.

Then, proceed to move p1 to l1_1 via airplane.

So steps for p1 after k:

l. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (a2 is initially at l2_1)

m. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

n. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (now p1 is in l1_1, satisfying constraint 1)

Then, move p1 to l1_4 using truck t1:

o. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 (t1 was at l1_4 initially)

p. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

q. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

r. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4 (goal achieved for p1)

Now, during this process, p2 was moved to l2_1 (step d) and needs to be returned to l2_3. So after step d, to return p2 to l2_3:

s. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (t2 is at l2_1 after step k)

t. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2

u. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (now p2 is back to original location)

But wait, after step k, t2 is at l2_1. So steps s, t, u can be done after step k.

But let's check the order of steps. The plan must sequence all these actions in order.

So the complete plan would involve:

1. Move p2 from l2_3 to l2_1 (steps a-d).

2. Move p1 from l2_2 to l2_3 (steps e-h).

3. Move p1 from l2_3 to l2_1 (steps i-k).

4. Fly p1 to l1_1 (steps l-n).

5. Move p1 to l1_4 (steps o-r).

6. Move p2 back to l2_3 (steps s-u).

But need to check if this satisfies all constraints.

Let's check the constraints:

- Constraint 1: p1 in l1_1. Satisfied at step n.

- Constraint 2: before step n (p1 in l1_1), p2 must have been in l2_1. Step d (p2 in l2_1) is before n. So yes.

- Constraint 3: p1 in l2_1. Satisfied at step k.

- Constraint 4: before step k (p1 in l2_1), either p2 in l2_5 or p1 in l2_3. At step h, p1 is in l2_3, which is before k. So satisfied.

- Constraint 5: p2 in l2_1. Satisfied at step d.

Now, but in step s, we load p2 from l2_1 into t2 and drive back. But this is after step k. So p2 is in l2_1 (step d) and then in steps s-u, moved back to l2_3. So the final state for p2 is l2_3, which meets the goal.

Now, what about the airplanes and trucks:

- a2 starts in l2_1. After step m, a2 is in l1_1. But after unloading p1 in l1_1 (step n), a2 is still in l1_1. If needed to use again, but in this plan, maybe not.

t1 is used in steps o-q to move p1 to l1_4.

Now, the plan seems to meet all constraints. Let's count the steps:

Steps a-d: 4 steps (drive, load, drive, unload) for p2.

Steps e-h: 4 steps (drive, load, drive, unload) for p1 to l2_3.

Steps i-k: 3 steps (load, drive, unload) for p1 to l2_1.

Steps l-n: 3 steps (load, fly, unload) for p1 to l1_1.

Steps o-r: 4 steps (drive, load, drive, unload) for p1 to l1_4.

Steps s-u: 3 steps (load, drive, unload) for p2 back to l2_3.

Total steps: 4+4+3+3+4+3= 21 steps. That's a lot. But the problem asks for an optimal plan, which is the shortest possible. Maybe there's a shorter way.

Let me try to optimize.

Alternative approach: can we combine some steps?

For example, when moving p2 to l2_1 and back, perhaps use the same truck movements. Or when moving p1 to l2_3 and then to l2_1.

Wait, after step d (p2 is in l2_1), t2 is at l2_1. Then, for p1's movement:

We need to get p1 from l2_2 to l2_3. So:

drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2 (but l2_1 and l2_2 are in c2. But can a truck drive from l2_1 to l2_2 directly? Yes, as long as they're in the same city.

Wait, city c2 includes locations l2_1 (airport), l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5. So trucks can drive between any locations in c2.

So after step d (t2 is at l2_1), to pick up p1 from l2_2:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2

2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2

4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (now p1 is in l2_3)

5. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

6. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

7. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (p1 in l2_1)

Then, proceed to fly p1 to l1_1.

But during this, p2 is already in l2_1 (from step d). But after step 7, we need to move p2 back to l2_3. So:

8. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

9. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2

10. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3

This way, steps for p2 are steps a-d (4 steps), then steps 8-10 (3 steps). Total for p2: 7 steps.

For p1: steps 1-7 (7 steps), then fly and truck steps.

Total steps so far: 7 (p2) +7 (p1) =14 steps. Then flying and moving to l1_4:

11. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

12. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

13. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

14. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1

15. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

16. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

17. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

That's another 7 steps. Total steps: 14 +7=21. Still 21 steps. Is there a shorter way?

Alternatively, after moving p1 to l2_1 (step7), load into airplane and fly to l1_1. Then, since t1 is in l1_4, drive to l1_1, load p1, drive back.

But can't we avoid some steps? For example, when flying p1 to l1_1, can we unload directly into a truck that's already there? But t1 is initially at l1_4. So we need to move it to l1_1 first.

So steps:

11. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

12. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

13. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

14. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1

15. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

16. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

17. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

This is necessary. So steps 14-17 can't be shortened.

Is there a way to reduce steps? Let's think.

Maybe combine the movement of t2 to pick up p1 and p2 in a single trip.

For example, after step d (p2 is in l2_1), drive t2 to l2_2 to pick up p1, then to l2_3 to drop off p1, then back to l2_1.

But how?

Alternatively, after moving p2 to l2_1 (step d), use t2 to pick up p1 from l2_2 and move it to l2_1. But then p1 would be in l2_1 without having been in l2_3. Which violates constraint 4 unless we have p2 in l2_5. But p2 is in l2_1, so that wouldn't work.

So perhaps moving p1 through l2_3 is necessary.

Hmm. It seems that the plan requires 21 steps. But maybe there's a smarter way.

Wait, the problem says the plan must be optimal, i.e., the shortest possible. So perhaps there's a way to satisfy the constraints with fewer steps.

Let's re-express the constraints:

1. p1 in l1_1 at least once.

2. When p1 is in l1_1, p2 was in l2_1 earlier.

3. p1 in l2_1 at least once.

4. When p1 is in l2_1, either p2 was in l2_5 or p1 was in l2_3 earlier.

5. p2 in l2_1 at least once.

So, can we arrange the plan such that some steps cover multiple constraints?

For example:

- When p1 is in l2_1 (constraint3), which is before it's in l1_1 (constraint1), and during that time, p2 is in l2_1 (constraint5). So if we move p1 to l2_1 first, then p2 to l2_1, but that would require p2 to be moved after p1 is in l2_1, which may not satisfy constraint2.

Alternatively, move p2 to l2_1 first (satisfies constraint5), then move p1 to l2_1 (satisfies constraint3) with p1's previous location being l2_2. But that doesn't satisfy constraint4, which requires that before p1 is in l2_1, either p2 was in l2_5 or p1 was in l2_3.

So to satisfy constraint4, either:

a. Before p1 is in l2_1, move p2 to l2_5.

or

b. Before p1 is in l2_1, move p1 to l2_3.

Option b seems more feasible. Because moving p1 to l2_3 requires fewer steps.

So:

1. Move p1 from l2_2 to l2_3.

   - drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2

   - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

   - drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2

   - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (p1 in l2_3)

This satisfies that p1 was in l2_3, which will help with constraint4.

2. Then move p1 to l2_1.

   - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (assuming t2 is at l2_3)

   - drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

   - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (p1 in l2_1, constraint3 met)

Now, since p1 was in l2_3 earlier, constraint4 is satisfied.

3. Now, move p2 to l2_1.

But p2 is in l2_3. So:

   - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2 (t2 was at l2_1 after step 2)

   - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3

   - drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

   - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (p2 in l2_1, constraint5 met)

Now, after this, when p1 is moved to l1_1, constraint2 is satisfied because p2 was in l2_1 earlier.

But this order may not work because the steps need to be in sequence.

Let me outline the steps:

Steps for p1:

a. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2

b. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

c. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2

d. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (p1 in l2_3)

e. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

f. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

g. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (p1 in l2_1, constraint3 met)

Steps for p2:

h. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2 (after step g, t2 is at l2_1)

i. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3

j. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

k. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (p2 in l2_1, constraint5 met)

Then move p1 to l1_1:

l. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

m. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

n. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (constraint1 met)

Move p1 to l1_4:

o. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1

p. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

q. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

r. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4 (goal)

Move p2 back to l2_3:

s. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

t. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2

u. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (goal)

This is again 21 steps.

But wait, after step k, p2 is in l2_1. Then, when p1 is loaded into the airplane (step l), p1 is in l2_1, which was achieved in step g. But constraint4 requires that before p1 is in l2_1 (step g), either p2 was in l2_5 or p1 was in l2_3. In this case, p1 was in l2_3 (step d) before step g. So constraint4 is satisfied.

Constraint2: before p1 is in l1_1 (step n), p2 must have been in l2_1 (step k) which is before step n. So yes.

Constraint5: p2 in l2_1 (step k). Yes.

So this plan satisfies all constraints, but it's 21 steps. Is there a way to optimize further?

Alternative idea: can p1 and p2 be moved in the same truck trip?

After moving p1 to l2_3 (step d), perhaps then load both p1 and p2 into the truck and drive to l2_1.

But p2 is in l2_3 initially. So steps:

After step d (p1 in l2_3):

e. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

f. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (but p2 is already in l2_3?)

Wait, no. Initially, p2 is in l2_3. To load p2 into the truck at l2_3, we need to have p2 and t2 in l2_3.

At step d, p1 is unloaded into l2_3. So p2 is in l2_3 (initial), and p1 is in l2_3. Then:

e. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

f. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (possible if both are in l2_3)

Then drive to l2_1:

g. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

h. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (constraint3)

i. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (constraint5)

This would combine moving both p1 and p2 to l2_1 in one trip. But can you load two packages into a truck in the same location?

The actions allow loading and unloading individual packages. So each package must be loaded separately. So steps e and f are separate actions. Then after driving, two unload steps.

This would save steps compared to previous plans. Let's see:

Original steps for p1 and p2 to get to l2_1:

Previous steps for p1: a-d (4 steps) to get to l2_3, then e-g (3 steps) to l2_1. For p2: h-k (4 steps). Total: 11 steps.

New approach:

a. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2 (t2 initial is l2_4)

b. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (p2 is in l2_3)

c. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2

d. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (p1 is in l2_2)

e. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2

f. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (p1 in l2_3)

g. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

h. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

i. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (constraint3)

j. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (constraint5)

This way, p2 is moved from l2_3 to l2_1 in steps b and h-j. But how?

Wait, initial p2 is in l2_3. So step b loads p2 into t2 at l2_3. Then drive to l2_2 to get p1 (steps c and d), then back to l2_3 (step e), unload p1 (step f), then reload p1 (step g), then drive to l2_1 and unload both.

But this seems convoluted and might not save steps.

Alternatively, perhaps:

After step d (p1 in l2_3), load both p1 and p2 into t2.

But p2 is in l2_3 initially, so:

a. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2 (t2 arrives at l2_3)

b. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (p2 loaded)

c. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (p1 is in l2_3 from step d, but how?)

Wait, no. Initially, p1 is in l2_2. So to get p1 to l2_3, we need to move it there first.

Hmm. This approach might not save steps.

Let me consider that the optimal plan requires moving p1 through l2_3 to satisfy constraint4, and moving p2 to l2_1 to satisfy constraints5 and 2. The minimal steps would involve:

- Moving p1 from l2_2 to l2_3 (3 steps: drive, load, drive, unload? Or drive to l2_2, load, drive to l2_3, unload: 4 steps).

- Then move p1 to l2_1 (3 steps: load, drive, unload).

- Move p2 from l2_3 to l2_1 (3 steps: load, drive, unload).

- Then fly p1 to l1_1 (3 steps: load, fly, unload).

- Move p1 from l1_1 to l1_4 (4 steps: drive truck to l1_1, load, drive back, unload).

- Move p2 back to l2_3 (3 steps: load, drive, unload).

Total steps: 4 +3 +3 +3 +4 +3 = 20 steps.

Is this possible?

Let's outline:

For p1:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2 (t2 from l2_4 to l2_2)

2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2

4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (p1 in l2_3)

5. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

6. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

7. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (p1 in l2_1)

For p2:

8. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (but p2 is in l2_3. Wait, no. After step7, t2 is at l2_1. To move p2 from l2_3 to l2_1, need to drive back.

8. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2

9. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3

10. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

11. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (p2 in l2_1)

Then fly p1:

12. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

13. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

14. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (p1 in l1_1)

Move p1 to l1_4:

15. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1

16. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

17. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

18. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4 (goal)

Move p2 back:

19. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

20. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2

21. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (goal)

Still 21 steps. I can't seem to find a shorter plan. Maybe there's a way to interleave steps or find overlaps.

Wait, after moving p1 to l2_1 (step7), t2 is at l2_1. Then, to move p2 to l2_1, steps8-11: drive t2 to l2_3, load p2, drive back. But during this, p1 is in l2_1. Then, after step11, p2 is in l2_1, which is needed for constraint2.

After that, when p1 is flown to l1_1, constraint2 is met because p2 was in l2_1 earlier (step11).

But perhaps after step7 (p1 in l2_1), before moving p2, we can fly p1 to l1_1. But then, when we fly p1, the p2 hasn't been moved to l2_1 yet, so constraint2 isn't met. So the order must be p2 to l2_1 first, then p1 to l1_1.

Wait, no. Because constraint2 requires that when p1 is in l1_1, there must be an earlier state where p2 is in l2_1. So p2 can be moved to l2_1 after p1 is in l1_1, as long as there's a previous state where p2 is in l2_1. But that's not possible. Because the state where p1 is in l1_1 comes after the flight, which would be after p2 is moved to l2_1.

But the flight can't happen before p2 is moved to l2_1.

So the correct order must be:

1. p2 is moved to l2_1.

2. p1 is moved to l2_1, ensuring that constraint4 is met (p1 was in l2_3 earlier).

3. p1 is flown to l1_1, which requires that p2 was in l2_1 earlier (step1).

But in this case, step1 (p2 to l2_1) happens before step3 (p1 to l1_1).

But in the previous plans, p2 is moved to l2_1 after p1 is already there, which may not satisfy constraint2. No, because constraint2 requires that if p1 is in l1_1, then there must be an earlier state where p2 is in l2_1. So as long as p2 is in l2_1 at any point before p1 is in l1_1, it's okay.

So perhaps the steps can be reordered.

For example:

- Move p1 to l2_3.

- Move p1 to l2_1.

- Move p2 to l2_1.

- Fly p1 to l1_1.

But then, p2 is moved to l2_1 after p1 is in l2_1, but before p1 is in l1_1.

This way, when p1 is in l1_1, p2 was in l2_1 earlier (even if p2 was moved to l2_1 after p1 was there).

This would satisfy constraint2.

So steps:

For p1:

a. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2

b. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

c. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2

d. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (p1 in l2_3)

e. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

f. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

g. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (p1 in l2_1)

For p2:

h. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2 (t2 is at l2_1 after step g)

i. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3

j. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

k. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (p2 in l2_1)

Then fly p1:

l. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

m. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

n. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

Move p1 to l1_4:

o. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1

p. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

q. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

r. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

Move p2 back:

s. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

t. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2

u. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3

This way, p2 is in l2_1 at step k, which is before p1 is flown to l1_1 (step n). So constraint2 is satisfied.

This is still 21 steps.

At this point, I think that given the constraints, this is the minimal number of steps required. Therefore, the optimal plan has 21 steps. However, I might be missing a shortcut. Let me double-check.

Wait, what if we use airplanes to move p2 to l2_5? But l2_5 is a location in c2, not an airport. Airplanes can only move between airports. So l2_1 is the airport in c2, and other airports are in other cities. So to move p2 to l2_5, we would need to use a truck. But l2_5 is in c2, so a truck can drive there.

If we move p2 to l2_5 instead of l2_1, then when p1 is in l2_1, the condition for constraint4 is met because p2 is in l2_5. But then, we need to move p2 to l2_5 and then back, but the goal is to have p2 in l2_3. However, this may not save steps.

Alternatively, if we can have p2 in l2_5 at some point, then when p1 is in l2_1, it satisfies constraint4. But moving p2 to l2_5 would require:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2

2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3

3. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2

4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5

Then, when p1 is moved to l2_1, constraint4 is satisfied because p2 is in l2_5. But then, we still need to move p2 back to l2_3. This would require additional steps. So total steps for p2 would be 4 (to l2_5) and 3 (back), total 7 steps. Same as before. So no gain.

But this way, when p1 is in l2_1, p2 is in l2_5, which satisfies constraint4. But this would require moving p2 to l2_5, which may not be better than moving it to l2_1.

Overall, it seems that the minimal plan is 21 steps. But perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Let me recount:

Steps 1-4: p1 to l2_3 (4 steps)

Steps 5-7: p1 to l2_1 (3 steps)

Steps 8-11: p2 to l2_1 (4 steps)

Steps 12-14: fly p1 to l1_1 (3 steps)

Steps 15-18: p1 to l1_4 (4 steps)

Steps 19-21: p2 back to l2_3 (3 steps)

Total: 4+3+4+3+4+3=21.

Yes. So the optimal plan is 21 steps. But the problem states that the answer must be optimal, which is the shortest possible. However, maybe there's a way to overlap some steps or use airplanes for both packages.

Wait, what if we use the airplane a2 to move p2 to l2_1? But l2_1 is the airport in c2. So p2 is in l2_3. To load p2 into an airplane, we need to drive it to l2_1. Which is what we were doing with the truck. So no gain.

Alternatively, if we could fly p2 directly from l2_3 to l2_1, but airplanes can only fly between airports. Since l2_3 is not an airport, we can't. So trucks are needed.

Therefore, I think the minimal plan has 21 steps. However, perhaps there's a way to reduce steps by reusing truck movements or combining actions.

Wait, after moving p1 to l2_1 (step7), t2 is at l2_1. Then, to move p2 to l2_1, steps8-11 require driving to l2_3 and back. But during this time, p1 is already in l2_1, which satisfies constraint3. But what if we move p2 first?

Alternative approach:

1. Move p2 to l2_1 first (steps a-d), then move p1 through l2_3 to l2_1, then fly p1.

But this would be similar to the previous plan.

Another idea: After moving p1 to l2_1, instead of moving p2 to l2_1, can we use a different method to satisfy constraint5? For example, p2 could be moved to l2_1 earlier, but then that would require moving it back. No, because the goal requires p2 to be in l2_3.

In all cases, it seems that the plan requires 21 steps. Therefore, the optimal plan is as follows:

```
```
drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
