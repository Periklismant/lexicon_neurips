Alright, let's understand the problem step by step.

We have:
- Cities: c1 and c2
- Locations in city c1: l1_1 (airport), l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5
- Locations in city c2: l2_1 (airport), l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5
- Packages: p1, p2
- Trucks: t1, t2
- Airplanes: a1, a2

The initial state is:
- t1 is in location l1_4
- t2 is in location l2_4
- p1 is in location l2_2
- p2 is in location l2_3
- a1 is in location l1_1
- a2 is in location l2_1

Our goal is:
- p1 is in location l1_4
- p2 is in location l2_3

We also have several constraints:
1. At some point, p1 must be in location l1_1.
2. If p1 is in location l1_1, then there must be an earlier state where p2 is in location l2_1.
3. At some point, p1 must be in location l2_1.
4. If p1 is in location l2_1, then there must be an earlier state where either p2 is in location l2_5 or p1 is in location l2_3.
5. At some point, p2 must be in location l2_1.

Let's plan this in reverse, starting from the constraints and working towards the goal.

1. p1 is in location l1_4 in the end.
2. p2 is in location l2_3 in the end.

From constraint 1, p1 must be in location l1_1 at some point. Since p1 starts in l2_2 and needs to end in l1_4, it makes sense to transport it from l2_2 to l1_1 (using an airplane) and then to l1_4 (using a truck).

From constraint 3, p1 must be in location l2_1 at some point. Since p1 starts in l2_2, it makes sense to transport it to l2_1 before flying it to l1_1.

From constraint 4, before p1 is in location l2_1, either p2 must be in location l2_5 or p1 must be in location l2_3. Since p1 starts in l2_2, it's easier to move it to l2_3 first, and then to l2_1.

From constraint 5, p2 must be in location l2_1 at some point. Since p2 starts in l2_3 and ends in l2_3, we can move it to l2_1 and then back to l2_3.

From constraint 2, before p1 is in location l1_1, p2 must be in location l2_1. So, we need to ensure p2 is in l2_1 before p1 reaches l1_1.

Now, let's plan the sequence of actions:

1. Move p1 from l2_2 to l2_3 using t2.
2. Move p1 from l2_3 to l2_1 using t2.
3. Move p2 from l2_3 to l2_1 using t2.
4. Move p1 from l2_1 to l1_1 using a2 and then a1.
5. Move p2 from l2_1 back to l2_3 using t2.
6. Move p1 from l1_1 to l1_4 using t1.

Let's see if this plan satisfies all the constraints:
- p1 is in location l1_1 at some point. ✓
- Before p1 is in location l1_1, p2 is in location l2_1. ✓
- p1 is in location l2_1 at some point. ✓
- Before p1 is in location l2_1, p1 is in location l2_3. ✓
- p2 is in location l2_1 at some point. ✓
- In the end, p1 is in location l1_4 and p2 is in location l2_3. ✓

I think this plan works, but let me detail the exact actions:

Actually, there's an issue with the initial state I've been using. Let me re-read the problem statement to clarify.

Ok, there seems to be some confusion in the initial state. The problem states:
"Package t1 is in location l1_4"
"Package t2 is in location l2_4"
"Package p1 is in location l2_2"
"Package p2 is in location l2_3"
"Package a1 is in location l1_1"
"Package a2 is in location l2_1"

But t1, t2, a1, and a2 are not packages. They are trucks and airplanes. Let me assume that it means:
"Truck t1 is in location l1_4"
"Truck t2 is in location l2_4"
"Package p1 is in location l2_2"
"Package p2 is in location l2_3"
"Airplane a1 is in location l1_1"
"Airplane a2 is in location l2_1"

Now let's proceed with the plan.

First, we need to move p1 from l2_2 to l2_3 to satisfy the constraint that before p1 is in location l2_1, p1 must be in location l2_3.

1. `drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2` - Drive truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_2.
2. `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2` - Load package p1 onto truck t2 at l2_2.
3. `drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2` - Drive truck t2 from l2_2 to l2_3.
4. `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3` - Unload package p1 from truck t2 at l2_3.

Now, p1 is in l2_3, satisfying one part of constraint 4.

Next, we need to move p1 to l2_1 to satisfy constraint 3.

5. `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3` - Load package p1 onto truck t2 at l2_3.
6. `loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3` - Load package p2 onto truck t2 at l2_3.
7. `drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2` - Drive truck t2 from l2_3 to l2_1.
8. `unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1` - Unload package p2 from truck t2 at l2_1.

Now, p2 is in l2_1, satisfying constraint 5.

9. `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1` - Unload package p1 from truck t2 at l2_1.

Now, p1 is in l2_1, satisfying constraint 3. And since p2 was in l2_1 before p1 was, constraint 2 is also satisfied.

Next, we need to move p1 to l1_1 to satisfy constraint 1.

10. `loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1` - Load package p1 onto airplane a2 at l2_1.
11. `flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1` - Fly airplane a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
12. `unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1` - Unload package p1 from airplane a2 at l1_1.

Now, p1 is in l1_1, satisfying constraint 1. And since p2 was in l2_1 before p1 was in l1_1, constraint 2 is satisfied.

Next, we need to move p1 to l1_4 to satisfy the goal.

13. `loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1` - Load package p1 onto truck t1 at l1_1. (We need to get t1 to l1_1 first).
Wait, t1 is at l1_4. We need to:

13. `drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1` - Drive truck t1 from l1_4 to l1_1.
14. `loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1` - Load package p1 onto truck t1 at l1_1.
15. `drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1` - Drive truck t1 from l1_1 to l1_4.
16. `unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4` - Unload package p1 from truck t1 at l1_4.

Now, p1 is in l1_4, satisfying the goal for p1.

Finally, we need to move p2 back to l2_3 to satisfy the goal for p2.

17. `loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1` - Load package p2 onto truck t2 at l2_1.
18. `drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2` - Drive truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_3.
19. `unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3` - Unload package p2 from truck t2 at l2_3.

Wait, I've overlooked something. Let me review the plan to ensure all the constraints are met.

1. Move t2 from l2_4 to l2_2. (drivetruck)
2. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_2. (loadtruck)
3. Move t2 from l2_2 to l2_3. (drivetruck)
4. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_3. (unloadtruck)

Now: 
- p1 is at l2_3
- p2 is at l2_3
- t2 is at l2_3

5. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_3. (loadtruck)
6. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_3. (loadtruck)
7. Move t2 from l2_3 to l2_1. (drivetruck)
8. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1. (unloadtruck)

Now:
- p1 is in t2 at l2_1
- p2 is at l2_1
- t2 is at l2_1

9. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1. (unloadtruck)

Now:
- p1 is at l2_1
- p2 is at l2_1
- t2 is at l2_1

Ah, I see the problem. I need to ensure that before p1 is in l2_1, either p2 is in l2_5 or p1 is in l2_3 (constraint 4). In the plan above, p1 is at l2_3, but then p1 and p2 are both loaded onto t2 and transported to l2_1. So, when p1 is unloaded at l2_1, the earlier condition of p1 being at l2_3 is already satisfied, and before that, neither p2 was at l2_5 nor p1 was at l2_3 during this plan.

Let's adjust the plan:

1. `drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2` - Drive truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_2.
2. `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2` - Load package p1 onto truck t2 at l2_2.
3. `drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2` - Drive truck t2 from l2_2 to l2_3.
4. `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3` - Unload package p1 from truck t2 at l2_3.

Now, p1 is in l2_3, which will satisfy one part of constraint 4.

5. `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3` - Load package p1 onto truck t2 at l2_3.
6. `drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2` - Drive truck t2 from l2_3 to l2_1.
7. `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1` - Unload package p1 from truck t2 at l2_1.

Now, p1 is in l2_1, satisfying constraint 3. Before this, p1 was in l2_3, which satisfies constraint 4.

8. `drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2` - Drive truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_3.
9. `loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3` - Load package p2 onto truck t2 at l2_3.
10. `drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2` - Drive truck t2 from l2_3 to l2_1.
11. `unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1` - Unload package p2 from truck t2 at l2_1.

Now, p2 is in l2_1, satisfying constraint 5.

12. `loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1` - Load package p1 onto airplane a2 at l2_1. (I assume p1 is still at l2_1 or we brought it back, if not, we need to adjust).

Ah, I realize there's an issue. After step 7, p1 is in l2_1. But I want to move p2 to l2_1 as well, to satisfy constraint 5. However, I can't just leave p1 at l2_1 and come back later, otherwise, I'd be violating constraint 2, which says that before p1 is in l1_1, p2 must be in l2_1. So, I need to ensure that p2 is at l2_1 before I move p1 to l1_1.

Let's restart the plan:

1. `drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2` - Drive truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_2.
2. `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2` - Load package p1 onto truck t2 at l2_2.
3. `drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2` - Drive truck t2 from l2_2 to l2_3.
4. `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3` - Unload package p1 from truck t2 at l2_3.

Now, p1 is in l2_3, which will satisfy one part of constraint 4. p2 is also in l2_3.

5. `loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3` - Load package p2 onto truck t2 at l2_3.
6. `drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2` - Drive truck t2 from l2_3 to l2_1.
7. `unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1` - Unload package p2 from truck t2 at l2_1.

Now, p2 is in l2_1, satisfying constraint 5.

8. `drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2` - Drive truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_3.
9. `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3` - Load package p1 onto truck t2 at l2_3.
10. `drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2` - Drive truck t2 from l2_3 to l2_1.
11. `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1` - Unload package p1 from truck t2 at l2_1.

Now, p1 is in l2_1, satisfying constraint 3. Before this, p1 was in l2_3, which satisfies constraint 4.

12. `loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1` - Load package p1 onto airplane a2 at l2_1.
13. `flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1` - Fly airplane a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
14. `unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1` - Unload package p1 from airplane a2 at l1_1.

Now, p1 is in l1_1, satisfying constraint 1. Before this, p2 was in l2_1, which satisfies constraint 2.

15. `drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1` - Drive truck t1 from l1_4 to l1_1.
16. `loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1` - Load package p1 onto truck t1 at l1_1.
17. `drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1` - Drive truck t1 from l1_1 to l1_4.
18. `unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4` - Unload package p1 from truck t1 at l1_4.

Now, p1 is in l1_4, satisfying one part of the goal.

19. `loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1` - Load package p2 onto truck t2 at l2_1.
20. `drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2` - Drive truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_3.
21. `unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3` - Unload package p2 from truck t2 at l2_3.

Now, p2 is in l2_3, satisfying the other part of the goal.

Let's double check our constraints:
1. p1 is in location l1_1 at some point. ✓ (Step 14)
2. Before p1 is in location l1_1, p2 is in location l2_1. ✓ (p2 is in l2_1 at step 7, before p1 is in l1_1 at step 14)
3. p1 is in location l2_1 at some point. ✓ (Step 11)
4. Before p1 is in location l2_1, p1 is in location l2_3. ✓ (p1 is in l2_3 at step 4, before p1 is in l2_1 at step 11)
5. p2 is in location l2_1 at some point. ✓ (Step 7)
- In the end, p1 is in location l1_4 and p2 is in location l2_3. ✓ (Steps 18 and 21)

So, the final plan is:

1. `drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2` - Drive truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_2.
2. `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2` - Load package p1 onto truck t2 at l2_2.
3. `drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2` - Drive truck t2 from l2_2 to l2_3.
4. `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3` - Unload package p1 from truck t2 at l2_3.
5. `loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3` - Load package p2 onto truck t2 at l2_3.
6. `drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2` - Drive truck t2 from l2_3 to l2_1.
7. `unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1` - Unload package p2 from truck t2 at l2_1.
8. `drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2` - Drive truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_3.
9. `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3` - Load package p1 onto truck t2 at l2_3.
10. `drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2` - Drive truck t2 from l2_3 to l2_1.
11. `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1` - Unload package p1 from truck t2 at l2_1.
12. `loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1` - Load package p1 onto airplane a2 at l2_1.
13. `flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1` - Fly airplane a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
14. `unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1` - Unload package p1 from airplane a2 at l1_1.
15. `drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1` - Drive truck t1 from l1_4 to l1_1.
16. `loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1` - Load package p1 onto truck t1 at l1_1.
17. `drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1` - Drive truck t1 from l1_1 to l1_4.
18. `unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4` - Unload package p1 from truck t1 at l1_4.
19. `loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1` - Load package p2 onto truck t2 at l2_1.
20. `drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2` - Drive truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_3.
21. `unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3` - Unload package p2 from truck t2 at l2_3.

Actually, I realized a further optimation. Step 8-11 could be simplified:

After step 7, t2 is at l2_1 and p1 is already at l2_3. We can directly:
8. `loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1` => This is incorrect because p1 is at l2_3, not l2_1.

So I need to bring p1 from l2_3 to l2_1 first:
8. `drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2` - Drive truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_3.
9. `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3` - Load package p1 onto truck t2 at l2_3.
10. `drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2` - Drive truck t2 from l2_3 to l2_1.
11. `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1` - Unload package p1 from truck t2 at l2_1.

This is the same as before, so no optimization is possible here.

Let's check again for optimizations:

Actually, an optimization can be made with p2. Instead of moving p2 to l2_1 and then back to l2_3, we can drop p1 at l2_1 (satisfying the constraint that p1 is at l2_1) without moving p2 at all. This way, p1 would still be at l2_3 at some point (satisfying one part of constraint 4), and p1 would still be at l2_1 at some point (satisfying constraint 3). But we would still need to move p2 to l2_1 at some point to satisfy constraint 5.

Let's try a different approach:

1. `drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2` - Drive truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_2.
2. `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2` - Load package p1 onto truck t2 at l2_2.
3. `drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2` - Drive truck t2 from l2_2 to l2_3.
4. `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3` - Unload package p1 from truck t2 at l2_3.

Now, p1 is in l2_3, which will satisfy one part of constraint 4.

5. `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3` - Load package p1 onto truck t2 at l2_3.
6. `loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3` - Load package p2 onto truck t2 at l2_3.
7. `drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2` - Drive truck t2 from l2_3 to l2_1.
8. `unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1` - Unload package p2 from truck t2 at l2_1.
9. `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1` - Unload package p1 from truck t2 at l2_1.

Now, both p1 and p2 are in l2_1, satisfying constraints 3 and 5.

10. `loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1` - Load package p1 onto airplane a2 at l2_1.
11. `flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1` - Fly airplane a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
12. `unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1` - Unload package p1 from airplane a2 at l1_1.

Now, p1 is in l1_1, satisfying constraint 1. Before this, p2 was in l2_1, which satisfies constraint 2.

13. `drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1` - Drive truck t1 from l1_4 to l1_1.
14. `loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1` - Load package p1 onto truck t1 at l1_1.
15. `drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1` - Drive truck t1 from l1_1 to l1_4.
16. `unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4` - Unload package p1 from truck t1 at l1_4.

Now, p1 is in l1_4, satisfying one part of the goal.

17. `loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1` - Load package p2 onto truck t2 at l2_1.
18. `drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2` - Drive truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_3.
19. `unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3` - Unload package p2 from truck t2 at l2_3.

Now, p2 is in l2_3, satisfying the other part of the goal.

Let's check our constraints:
1. p1 is in location l1_1 at some point. ✓ (Step 12)
2. Before p1 is in location l1_1, p2 is in location l2_1. ✓ (p2 is in l2_1 at step 8, before p1 is in l1_1 at step 12)
3. p1 is in location l2_1 at some point. ✓ (Step 9)
4. Before p1 is in location l2_1, p1 is in location l2_3. ✓ (p1 is in l2_3 at step 4, before p1 is in l2_1 at step 9)
5. p2 is in location l2_1 at some point. ✓ (Step 8)
- In the end, p1 is in location l1_4 and p2 is in location l2_3. ✓ (Steps 16 and 19)

This is actually the same plan as before, but with steps 5 and 6 swapped. But I think swapping them doesn't matter, as they both involve loading packages onto the same truck at the same location.

Let's see if the plan can be further optimized. Actually, I was overthinking. We can simplify steps 4-9 since p2 is already at l2_3:

1. `drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2` - Drive truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_2.
2. `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2` - Load package p1 onto truck t2 at l2_2.
3. `drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2` - Drive truck t2 from l2_2 to l2_3.
4. `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3` - Unload package p1 from truck t2 at l2_3.
5. `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3` - Load package p1 onto truck t2 at l2_3.
6. `loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3` - Load package p2 onto truck t2 at l2_3.
7. `drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2` - Drive truck t2 from l2_3 to l2_1.
8. `unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1` - Unload package p2 from truck t2 at l2_1.
9. `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1` - Unload package p1 from truck t2 at l2_1.

But wait, steps 4 and 5 are redundant. Why unload p1 only to load it back immediately?

1. `drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2` - Drive truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_2.
2. `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2` - Load package p1 onto truck t2 at l2_2.
3. `drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2` - Drive truck t2 from l2_2 to l2_3.
4. `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3` - Unload package p1 from truck t2 at l2_3.

Hmm, but there's constraint 4: "If p1 is in location l2_1, then there must be an earlier state in which either p2 is in location l2_5 or p1 is in location l2_3."

I need to ensure that p1 is in l2_3 at some point before it's in l2_1. So steps 4 and 5 are necessary to satisfy this constraint.

Checking again for optimizations: maybe not all the way to constraint 1, p1 can be at l1_1?

Let me reconsider the problem from first principles:

Goal: 
- p1 is in location l1_4
- p2 is in location l2_3

Constraints:
1. At some point, p1 must be in location l1_1.
2. If p1 is in location l1_1, then there must be an earlier state where p2 is in location l2_1.
3. At some point, p1 must be in location l2_1.
4. If p1 is in location l2_1, then there must be an earlier state where either p2 is in location l2_5 or p1 is in location l2_3.
5. At some point, p2 must be in location l2_1.

Initial state:
- t1 is in location l1_4
- t2 is in location l2_4
- p1 is in location l2_2
- p2 is in location l2_3
- a1 is in location l1_1
- a2 is in location l2_1

The two routes for p1 and p2 are:
p1: l2_2 -> l2_3 -> l2_1 -> l1_1 -> l1_4
p2: l2_3 -> l2_1 -> l2_3

To ensure p1 is in l2_3 before it's in l2_1, I think I need to unload and then reload it. But maybe there's a more subtle interpretation of the constraint?

Let's carefully consider constraint 4: "If p1 is in location l2_1, then there must be an earlier state in which either p2 is in location l2_5 or p1 is in location l2_3."

This means that before p1 is in l2_1, either p2 must be in l2_5 or p1 must be in l2_3. It doesn't mean that p1 must physically be in l2_3 at some point and then move to l2_1. It just means that in the state history, there must be a state where either p2 is in l2_5 or p1 is in l2_3, and this state must occur before a state where p1 is in l2_1.

So, perhaps we can optimize by having p1 be in l2_3 while still in the truck?

But I think the strict interpretation of "p1 is in location l2_3" means p1 is physically in l2_3, not inside a truck that's in l2_3.

Let's keep the unloading and reloading steps for clarity and to ensure all constraints are satisfied:

1. `drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2` - Drive truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_2.
2. `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2` - Load package p1 onto truck t2 at l2_2.
3. `drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2` - Drive truck t2 from l2_2 to l2_3.
4. `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3` - Unload package p1 from truck t2 at l2_3.
5. `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3` - Load package p1 onto truck t2 at l2_3.
6. `loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3` - Load package p2 onto truck t2 at l2_3.
7. `drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2` - Drive truck t2 from l2_3 to l2_1.
8. `unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1` - Unload package p2 from truck t2 at l2_1.
9. `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1` - Unload package p1 from truck t2 at l2_1.
10. `loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1` - Load package p1 onto airplane a2 at l2_1.
11. `flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1` - Fly airplane a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
12. `unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1` - Unload package p1 from airplane a2 at l1_1.
13. `drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1` - Drive truck t1 from l1_4 to l1_1.
14. `loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1` - Load package p1 onto truck t1 at l1_1.
15. `drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1` - Drive truck t1 from l1_1 to l1_4.
16. `unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4` - Unload package p1 from truck t1 at l1_4.
17. `loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1` - Load package p2 onto truck t2 at l2_1.
18. `drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2` - Drive truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_3.
19. `unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3` - Unload package p2 from truck t2 at l2_3.

Actually, hang on. There's another optimization:

Given that p2 is already at l2_3 in the initial state, do we need to transport it to l2_1 and then back to l2_3?

The constraint is that p2 must be in l2_1 at some point. But if the goal is for p2 to be in l2_3, then it seems like an unnecessary step to move it to l2_1 and then back to l2_3.

Actually, constraint 2 requires that before p1 is in location l1_1, p2 must be in location l2_1. So, it's necessary to transport p2 to l2_1.

Let's go with the plan I described earlier:

1. `drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2` - Drive truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_2.
2. `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2` - Load package p1 onto truck t2 at l2_2.
3. `drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2` - Drive truck t2 from l2_2 to l2_3.
4. `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3` - Unload package p1 from truck t2 at l2_3.
5. `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3` - Load package p1 onto truck t2 at l2_3.
6. `loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3` - Load package p2 onto truck t2 at l2_3.
7. `drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2` - Drive truck t2 from l2_3 to l2_1.
8. `unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1` - Unload package p2 from truck t2 at l2_1.
9. `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1` - Unload package p1 from truck t2 at l2_1.
10. `loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1` - Load package p1 onto airplane a2 at l2_1.
11. `flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1` - Fly airplane a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
12. `unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1` - Unload package p1 from airplane a2 at l1_1.
13. `drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1` - Drive truck t1 from l1_4 to l1_1.
14. `loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1` - Load package p1 onto truck t1 at l1_1.
15. `drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1` - Drive truck t1 from l1_1 to l1_4.
16. `unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4` - Unload package p1 from truck t1 at l1_4.
17. `loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1` - Load package p2 onto truck t2 at l2_1.
18. `drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2` - Drive truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_3.
19. `unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3` - Unload package p2 from truck t2 at l2_3.

I think this is the optimal plan that satisfies all the constraints.

Actually, I realized there's a potential optimization at steps 5 and 6. 

Since step 4 is unloading p1 from t2 at l2_3, after that, p1 is at l2_3 and t2 is at l2_3. Then, in step 5, we load p1 back onto t2. In step 6, we also load p2 onto t2.

However, the constraint is that before p1 is in l2_1, either p2 is in l2_5 or p1 is in l2_3. Since we unload p1 at l2_3, that constraint is already satisfied. So there's no need to load p1 back onto t2 if we're just going to transport p2 to l2_1. In other words, we can skip steps 5-9 and directly transport p2 to l2_1:

1. `drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2` - Drive truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_2.
2. `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2` - Load package p1 onto truck t2 at l2_2.
3. `drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2` - Drive truck t2 from l2_2 to l2_3.
4. `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3` - Unload package p1 from truck t2 at l2_3. (p1 is now in l2_3)
5. `loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3` - Load package p2 onto truck t2 at l2_3.
6. `drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2` - Drive truck t2 from l2_3 to l2_1.
7. `unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1` - Unload package p2 from truck t2 at l2_1. (p2 is now in l2_1)
8. `drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2` - Drive truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_3.
9. `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3` - Load package p1 onto truck t2 at l2_3.
10. `drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2` - Drive truck t2 from l2_3 to l2_1.
11. `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1` - Unload package p1 from truck t2 at l2_1. (p1 is now in l2_1)
12. `loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1` - Load package p1 onto airplane a2 at l2_1.
13. `flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1` - Fly airplane a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
14. `unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1` - Unload package p1 from airplane a2 at l1_1. (p1 is now in l1_1)
15. `drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1` - Drive truck t1 from l1_4 to l1_1.
16. `loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1` - Load package p1 onto truck t1 at l1_1.
17. `drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1` - Drive truck t1 from l1_1 to l1_4.
18. `unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4` - Unload package p1 from truck t1 at l1_4. (p1 is now in l1_4, satisfying the goal)
19. `loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1` - Load package p2 onto truck t2 at l2_1.
20. `drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2` - Drive truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_3.
21. `unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3` - Unload package p2 from truck t2 at l2_3. (p2 is now in l2_3, satisfying the goal)

Ah, this is actually more steps! Let's go back to the original plan. The original plan was:

1. `drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2` - Drive truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_2.
2. `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2` - Load package p1 onto truck t2 at l2_2.
3. `drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2` - Drive truck t2 from l2_2 to l2_3.
4. `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3` - Unload package p1 from truck t2 at l2_3.
5. `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3` - Load package p1 onto truck t2 at l2_3.
6. `loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3` - Load package p2 onto truck t2 at l2_3.
7. `drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2` - Drive truck t2 from l2_3 to l2_1.
8. `unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1` - Unload package p2 from truck t2 at l2_1.
9. `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1` - Unload package p1 from truck t2 at l2_1.
10. `loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1` - Load package p1 onto airplane a2 at l2_1.
11. `flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1` - Fly airplane a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
12. `unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1` - Unload package p1 from airplane a2 at l1_1.
13. `drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1` - Drive truck t1 from l1_4 to l1_1.
14. `loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1` - Load package p1 onto truck t1 at l1_1.
15. `drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1` - Drive truck t1 from l1_1 to l1_4.
16. `unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4` - Unload package p1 from truck t1 at l1_4.
17. `loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1` - Load package p2 onto truck t2 at l2_1.
18. `drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2` - Drive truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_3.
19. `unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3` - Unload package p2 from truck t2 at l2_3.

Actually, I was right before. Staring now from the state at step 4 where p1 is in l2_3 and p2 is in l2_3, we have two options, both of which satisfy constraint 4:

Option 1:
- Load p1 and p2 onto t2.
- Transport both to l2_1.
- Unload both packages.

Option 2:
- Load only p2 onto t2.
- Transport p2 to l2_1.
- Come back to l2_3.
- Load p1 onto t2.
- Transport p1 to l2_1.
- Unload p1.

Option 1 is more efficient because it requires fewer steps. So, let's stick with the original plan.

Recapitulating the final plan:

1. `drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2` - Drive truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_2.
2. `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2` - Load package p1 onto truck t2 at l2_2.
3. `drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2` - Drive truck t2 from l2_2 to l2_3.
4. `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3` - Unload package p1 from truck t2 at l2_3.
5. `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3` - Load package p1 onto truck t2 at l2_3.
6. `loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3` - Load package p2 onto truck t2 at l2_3.
7. `drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2` - Drive truck t2 from l2_3 to l2_1.
8. `unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1` - Unload package p2 from truck t2 at l2_1.
9. `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1` - Unload package p1 from truck t2 at l2_1.
10. `loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1` - Load package p1 onto airplane a2 at l2_1.
11. `flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1` - Fly airplane a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
12. `unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1` - Unload package p1 from airplane a2 at l1_1.
13. `drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1` - Drive truck t1 from l1_4 to l1_1.
14. `loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1` - Load package p1 onto truck t1 at l1_1.
15. `drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1` - Drive truck t1 from l1_1 to l1_4.
16. `unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4` - Unload package p1 from truck t1 at l1_4.
17. `loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1` - Load package p2 onto truck t2 at l2_1.
18. `drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2` - Drive truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_3.
19. `unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3` - Unload package p2 from truck t2 at l2_3.

This plan satisfies all the constraints and goals while being optimal in terms of the number of steps.

Minor note: I saw I made a mistake in the the action format. The correct action format for unloading from an airplane is `unloadairplane`, not `loadairplane`. Let's correct that:

12. `unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1` - Unload package p1 from airplane a2 at l1_1.
