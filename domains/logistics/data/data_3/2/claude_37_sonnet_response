I need to parse the problem statement carefully and come up with a plan to deliver the packages to their desired locations while satisfying all constraints.

First, let me identify what we have:

**Objects**:
- Locations: l1_1, l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5, l2_1, l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5
- Cities: c1, c2
- Airports: l1_1 (in city c1), l2_1 (in city c2)
- Packages: p1, p2
- Trucks: t1, t2
- Airplanes: a1, a2

**Initial State**:
- Locations l1_1, l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5 are in city c1
- Locations l2_1, l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5 are in city c2
- Package p1 is in location l1_2
- Package p2 is in location l2_1
- Truck t1 is in location l1_4
- Truck t2 is in location l2_1
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

Wait, there's an error in the initial state. It's saying "Package t1 is in location l1_4" and "Package t2 is in location l2_1", but t1 and t2 are trucks, not packages. Similarly, it's saying "Package a1 is in location l1_1" and "Package a2 is in location l2_1", but a1 and a2 are airplanes, not packages. I'll assume these are typos and what they meant was:

**Initial State (corrected)**:
- Locations l1_1, l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5 are in city c1
- Locations l2_1, l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5 are in city c2
- Package p1 is in location l1_2
- Package p2 is in location l2_1
- Truck t1 is in location l1_4
- Truck t2 is in location l2_1
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

**Goal**:
- Package p1 should be in location l1_5
- Package p2 should be in location l2_1

**Constraints**:
1. At some point, p1 should be in location l1_2 (which is already satisfied in the initial state).
2. If p1 is in location l1_2, then it should also be in location l2_3 at some point afterward.
3. At some point, p2 should be in airplane a2.
4. At some point, p1 should be in truck t2.

Now, let's reason about a plan.

Starting with package p1, which begins in location l1_2 in city c1 and needs to end in location l1_5 in the same city. However, because of constraint 2, it also needs to visit location l2_3 in city c2. Due to constraint 4, p1 should be in truck t2 at some point, and t2 is initially in city c2. So, we need to transport p1 from city c1 to city c2, have it be in t2, and then return it to city c1 to be delivered to l1_5.

For package p2, which begins in location l2_1 in city c2 and needs to end in the same location, it seems we just need to ensure it's in airplane a2 at some point (constraint 3) and then return it to l2_1.

Let's outline a plan:

1. Move truck t1 from l1_4 to l1_2 in city c1.
2. Load package p1 onto truck t1 at location l1_2.
3. Drive truck t1 from l1_2 to airport l1_1 in city c1.
4. Unload package p1 from truck t1 at location l1_1.
5. Load package p1 onto airplane a1 at location l1_1.
6. Fly airplane a1 from airport l1_1 to airport l2_1 in city c2.
7. Unload package p1 from airplane a1 at location l2_1.
8. Load package p1 onto truck t2 at location l2_1 (satisfying constraint 4).
9. Drive truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_3 in city c2 (satisfying constraint 2).
10. Unload package p1 from truck t2 at location l2_3.
11. Load package p1 onto truck t2 at location l2_3.
12. Drive truck t2 from l2_3 to airport l2_1 in city c2.
13. Unload package p1 from truck t2 at location l2_1.
14. Load package p1 onto airplane a1 at location l2_1.
15. Fly airplane a1 from airport l2_1 to airport l1_1 in city c1.
16. Unload package p1 from airplane a1 at location l1_1.
17. Load package p1 onto truck t1 at location l1_1.
18. Drive truck t1 from l1_1 to l1_5 in city c1.
19. Unload package p1 from truck t1 at location l1_5 (goal for p1 is satisfied).

For package p2:
20. Load package p2 onto airplane a2 at location l2_1 (satisfying constraint 3).
21. Unload package p2 from airplane a2 at location l2_1 (goal for p2 is satisfied).

This is just an outline, and I need to make sure all the preconditions of actions are satisfied. Let's verify and refine the plan.

Actually, I've made a mistake in my reasoning. Package p2 is already in location l2_1, which is its goal location. However, constraint 3 requires that p2 be in airplane a2 at some point. So we just need to have p2 loaded into a2 and then unloaded back to l2_1.

Let's refine the plan:

1. Move truck t1 from l1_4 to l1_2 in city c1.
2. Load package p1 onto truck t1 at location l1_2.
3. Drive truck t1 from l1_2 to airport l1_1 in city c1.
4. Unload package p1 from truck t1 at location l1_1.
5. Load package p1 onto airplane a1 at location l1_1.
6. Fly airplane a1 from airport l1_1 to airport l2_1 in city c2.
7. Unload package p1 from airplane a1 at location l2_1.
8. Load package p1 onto truck t2 at location l2_1 (satisfying constraint 4).
9. Drive truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_3 in city c2 (satisfying constraint 2).
10. Unload package p1 from truck t2 at location l2_3.
11. Drive truck t2 from l2_3 to airport l2_1 in city c2.
12. Load package p1 onto airplane a1 at location l2_1.
13. Fly airplane a1 from airport l2_1 to airport l1_1 in city c1.
14. Unload package p1 from airplane a1 at location l1_1.
15. Load package p1 onto truck t1 at location l1_1.
16. Drive truck t1 from l1_1 to l1_5 in city c1.
17. Unload package p1 from truck t1 at location l1_5 (goal for p1 is satisfied).

For package p2:
18. Load package p2 onto airplane a2 at location l2_1 (satisfying constraint 3).
19. Unload package p2 from airplane a2 at location l2_1 (goal for p2 is satisfied).

Let's review this plan to ensure all preconditions are met and that it achieves the goals:

1. Move truck t1 from l1_4 to l1_2 in city c1 (using drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1).
   - Precondition: t1 is in l1_4 (satisfied by the initial state).
   - Effect: t1 is now in l1_2.

2. Load package p1 onto truck t1 at location l1_2 (using loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2).
   - Precondition: p1 and t1 are in l1_2 (satisfied by the initial state for p1 and the previous action for t1).
   - Effect: p1 is in t1 and no longer in l1_2.

3. Drive truck t1 from l1_2 to airport l1_1 in city c1 (using drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1).
   - Precondition: t1 is in l1_2 (satisfied by the previous action).
   - Effect: t1 is now in l1_1.

4. Unload package p1 from truck t1 at location l1_1 (using unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1).
   - Precondition: p1 is in t1 and t1 is in l1_1 (satisfied by the previous actions).
   - Effect: p1 is now in l1_1 and no longer in t1.

5. Load package p1 onto airplane a1 at location l1_1 (using loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1).
   - Precondition: p1 and a1 are in l1_1 (satisfied by the previous action for p1 and the initial state for a1).
   - Effect: p1 is in a1 and no longer in l1_1.

6. Fly airplane a1 from airport l1_1 to airport l2_1 in city c2 (using flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1).
   - Precondition: a1 is in l1_1 (satisfied by the initial state).
   - Effect: a1 is now in l2_1.

Wait, I noticed that the action name loadairplane is mistakenly used where it should be unloadairplane in the action specifications. I'll correct that.

The correct actions are:
- loadtruck p t l: Load package p in truck t. Both p and t are in location l.
- loadairplane p ap l: Load package p in airplane ap. Both p and ap are in location l.
- unloadtruck p t l: Unload package p from truck t in location l.
- unloadairplane p ap l: Unload package p from airplane ap in location l.
- drivetruck t l_from l_to c: Drive truck t from location l_from to location l_to in city c.
- flyairplane ap l_from l_to: Fly airplane ap from location l_from to location l_to.

Continuing my verification:

6. Fly airplane a1 from airport l1_1 to airport l2_1 in city c2 (using flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1).
   - Precondition: a1 is in l1_1 (satisfied by the initial state).
   - Effect: a1 is now in l2_1.

7. Unload package p1 from airplane a1 at location l2_1 (using unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1).
   - Precondition: p1 is in a1 and a1 is in l2_1 (satisfied by the previous actions).
   - Effect: p1 is now in l2_1 and no longer in a1.

8. Load package p1 onto truck t2 at location l2_1 (using loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1).
   - Precondition: p1 and t2 are in l2_1 (satisfied by the previous action for p1 and the initial state for t2).
   - Effect: p1 is in t2 and no longer in l2_1.

9. Drive truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_3 in city c2 (using drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2).
   - Precondition: t2 is in l2_1 (satisfied by the initial state).
   - Effect: t2 is now in l2_3.

10. Unload package p1 from truck t2 at location l2_3 (using unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3).
    - Precondition: p1 is in t2 and t2 is in l2_3 (satisfied by the previous actions).
    - Effect: p1 is now in l2_3 and no longer in t2.

11. Drive truck t2 from l2_3 to airport l2_1 in city c2 (using drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2).
    - Precondition: t2 is in l2_3 (satisfied by the previous action).
    - Effect: t2 is now in l2_1.

12. Load package p1 onto airplane a1 at location l2_1 (using loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1).
    - Precondition: p1 and a1 are in l2_1 (but this is not satisfied yet, because p1 is in l2_3!).

So I have a mistake here. Let's adjust the plan:

11. Load package p1 onto truck t2 at location l2_3 (using loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3).
    - Precondition: p1 and t2 are in l2_3 (satisfied by the previous actions).
    - Effect: p1 is in t2 and no longer in l2_3.

12. Drive truck t2 from l2_3 to airport l2_1 in city c2 (using drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2).
    - Precondition: t2 is in l2_3 (satisfied by the previous actions).
    - Effect: t2 is now in l2_1.

13. Unload package p1 from truck t2 at location l2_1 (using unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1).
    - Precondition: p1 is in t2 and t2 is in l2_1 (satisfied by the previous actions).
    - Effect: p1 is now in l2_1 and no longer in t2.

14. Load package p1 onto airplane a1 at location l2_1 (using loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1).
    - Precondition: p1 and a1 are in l2_1 (satisfied by the previous actions).
    - Effect: p1 is in a1 and no longer in l2_1.

15. Fly airplane a1 from airport l2_1 to airport l1_1 in city c1 (using flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1).
    - Precondition: a1 is in l2_1 (satisfied by the previous actions).
    - Effect: a1 is now in l1_1.

16. Unload package p1 from airplane a1 at location l1_1 (using unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1).
    - Precondition: p1 is in a1 and a1 is in l1_1 (satisfied by the previous actions).
    - Effect: p1 is now in l1_1 and no longer in a1.

17. Load package p1 onto truck t1 at location l1_1 (using loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1).
    - Precondition: p1 and t1 are in l1_1 (but we need to ensure t1 is at l1_1).

I realized I haven't been keeping track of t1's location. Let's assume t1 is at l1_1 at this point (since we drove it there in step 3), but it might have moved since then. Let me refine the plan further:

1. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1
2. Loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
3. Drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
4. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
5. Loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
6. Flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
7. Unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
8. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
9. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
10. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
11. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
12. Drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
13. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
14. Loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
15. Flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
16. Unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
17. Loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
18. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
19. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
20. Loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
21. Unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

Double-checking this plan, I notice a redundancy in steps 10 and 11 (unload and reload p1 on t2 at l2_3). This is unnecessary and can be omitted. Let's refine the plan once more:

1. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1
2. Loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
3. Drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
4. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
5. Loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
6. Flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
7. Unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
8. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
9. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
10. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
11. Drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
12. Loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
   - Wait, this won't work because p1 is in l2_3 after step 10, not in l2_1.

Let's correct this:

1. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1
2. Loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
3. Drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
4. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
5. Loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
6. Flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
7. Unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
8. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
9. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
10. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
11. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
12. Drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
13. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
14. Loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
15. Flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
16. Unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
17. Loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
18. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
19. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
20. Loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
21. Unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

Let's double-check this final plan once more:

1. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1
   - Precondition: t1 is in l1_4 (satisfied by initial state).
   - Effect: t1 is now in l1_2.

2. Loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
   - Precondition: p1 and t1 are in l1_2 (satisfied by initial state for p1 and previous action for t1).
   - Effect: p1 is in t1 and no longer in l1_2.

3. Drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
   - Precondition: t1 is in l1_2 (satisfied by previous action).
   - Effect: t1 is now in l1_1.

4. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
   - Precondition: p1 is in t1 and t1 is in l1_1 (satisfied by previous actions).
   - Effect: p1 is now in l1_1 and no longer in t1.

5. Loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
   - Precondition: p1 and a1 are in l1_1 (satisfied by previous action for p1 and initial state for a1).
   - Effect: p1 is in a1 and no longer in l1_1.

6. Flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
   - Precondition: a1 is in l1_1 (satisfied by initial state).
   - Effect: a1 is now in l2_1.

7. Unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
   - Precondition: p1 is in a1 and a1 is in l2_1 (satisfied by previous actions).
   - Effect: p1 is now in l2_1 and no longer in a1.

8. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
   - Precondition: p1 and t2 are in l2_1 (satisfied by previous action for p1 and initial state for t2).
   - Effect: p1 is in t2 and no longer in l2_1.

9. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
   - Precondition: t2 is in l2_1 (satisfied by initial state).
   - Effect: t2 is now in l2_3.

10. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
    - Precondition: p1 is in t2 and t2 is in l2_3 (satisfied by previous actions).
    - Effect: p1 is now in l2_3 and no longer in t2.

11. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
    - Precondition: p1 and t2 are in l2_3 (satisfied by previous actions).
    - Effect: p1 is in t2 and no longer in l2_3.

12. Drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
    - Precondition: t2 is in l2_3 (satisfied by previous actions).
    - Effect: t2 is now in l2_1.

13. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
    - Precondition: p1 is in t2 and t2 is in l2_1 (satisfied by previous actions).
    - Effect: p1 is now in l2_1 and no longer in t2.

14. Loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
    - Precondition: p1 and a1 are in l2_1 (satisfied by previous actions).
    - Effect: p1 is in a1 and no longer in l2_1.

15. Flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
    - Precondition: a1 is in l2_1 (satisfied by previous actions).
    - Effect: a1 is now in l1_1.

16. Unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
    - Precondition: p1 is in a1 and a1 is in l1_1 (satisfied by previous actions).
    - Effect: p1 is now in l1_1 and no longer in a1.

17. Loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
    - Precondition: p1 and t1 are in l1_1 (satisfied by previous actions).
    - Effect: p1 is in t1 and no longer in l1_1.

18. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
    - Precondition: t1 is in l1_1 (satisfied by previous actions).
    - Effect: t1 is now in l1_5.

19. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
    - Precondition: p1 is in t1 and t1 is in l1_5 (satisfied by previous actions).
    - Effect: p1 is now in l1_5 and no longer in t1.

20. Loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
    - Precondition: p2 and a2 are in l2_1 (satisfied by initial state).
    - Effect: p2 is in a2 and no longer in l2_1.

21. Unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
    - Precondition: p2 is in a2 and a2 is in l2_1 (satisfied by previous action).
    - Effect: p2 is now in l2_1 and no longer in a2.

This plan meets all the constraints:
1. p1 is in location l1_2 in step 1 (satisfied by the initial state).
2. p1 is in location l2_3 in step 10, which is after it's in l1_2.
3. p2 is in airplane a2 in step 20.
4. p1 is in truck t2 from steps 8 to 13.

And the goals are achieved:
- p1 is in location l1_5 after step 19.
- p2 is in location l2_1 after step 21.

So, this plan is valid. However, I notice that we can simplify the plan:

Instead of (11. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3, 12. Drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2, 13. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1), we could have t1 come to l2_3, load p1, and then continue the plan. But, we'd need to bring t1 from c1 to c2, which would involve extra flyairplane actions and might not be optimal.

Actually, I just realized a better simplification.

We don't need to bring p1 back to l2_1 to load it onto a1. Instead, we could fly a1 to l2_3, load p1 directly there, and continue the plan. But, I'm not sure if l2_3 is an airport. The problem statement only mentioned that l1_1 and l2_1 are airports. So, let's stick with the original plan.

So our final, simplified optimal plan is:

1. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1
2. Loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
3. Drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
4. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
5. Loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
6. Flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
7. Unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
8. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
9. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
10. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
11. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
12. Drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
13. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
14. Loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
15. Flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
16. Unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
17. Loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
18. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
19. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
20. Loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
21. Unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

Actually, I want to double check once more if there's any redundancy in the plan. Let me trace through the steps and the state changes to make sure:

1. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1
   - t1 moves from l1_4 to l1_2.

2. Loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
   - p1 is loaded into t1 at l1_2.

3. Drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
   - t1 (with p1 inside) moves from l1_2 to l1_1.

4. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
   - p1 is unloaded from t1 at l1_1.

5. Loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
   - p1 is loaded into a1 at l1_1.

6. Flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
   - a1 (with p1 inside) flies from l1_1 to l2_1.

7. Unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
   - p1 is unloaded from a1 at l2_1.

8. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
   - p1 is loaded into t2 at l2_1.

9. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
   - t2 (with p1 inside) moves from l2_1 to l2_3.

10. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
    - p1 is unloaded from t2 at l2_3.

11. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
    - p1 is loaded into t2 at l2_3.

Steps 10 and 11 are redundant. If I've already got p1 in t2, there's no need to unload it only to load it again. I can omit these steps. But I need to ensure the constraint that "p1 is in location l2_3" at some point. At the end of step 9, p1 is in t2, not in location l2_3. So, I can't say p1 is in location l2_3 yet. 

Let me revisit the constraint: "If expression 'Package p1 is in location l1_2' holds in some state s, then expression 'Package p1 is in location l2_3' must hold at s or at some state after s." So, after p1 is in location l1_2, it needs to be in location l2_3 at some point. 

Hmm, let's reconsider the original constraint: If p1 is in location l1_2, it must be in location l2_3 at some point later. To satisfy this, we need to ensure p1 is actually in location l2_3, not inside a truck at location l2_3. This is why I had 10 & 11 previously.

So, our final plan is correct and there are no redundancies that can be removed while still satisfying the constraints.

Let's formalize the plan using the exact action names required:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
3. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
5. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
6. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
7. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
8. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
9. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2

Wait a second, let me carefully re-read the problem statement to ensure I've understood it correctly. 

The goal is: "Package p1 is in location l1_5", "Package p2 is in location l2_1"
The constraints are:
1. At some point, p1 should be in location l1_2 (which is already satisfied in the initial state).
2. If p1 is in location l1_2, then it should also be in location l2_3 at some point afterward.
3. At some point, p2 should be in airplane a2.
4. At some point, p1 should be in truck t2.

One more issue: in the initial state, p1 is already in location l1_2, so the first constraint is already satisfied. But I start by moving p1 out of location l1_2. This is fine, and consistent with the constraint. I just need to ensure that p1 visits l2_3 afterwards, which it does.

So, the plan remains:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
3. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
5. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
6. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
7. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
8. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
9. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
10. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
11. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
12. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
13. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
14. loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
15. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
16. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
17. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
18. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
19. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
20. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
21. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

This plan is valid and satisfies all the constraints and goals. It's a good plan.

Hmm, but can we make it even better? Or is it really optimal? Let's double check if I can shorten it through other optimizations.

Let's think it through again: p1 starts in l1_2 and needs to end in l1_5. But due to constraint 2, it needs to visit location l2_3 somewhere along the journey. And due to constraint 4, p1 needs to be in truck t2 at some point.

Since the only way to move between cities is by airplane, and airplanes can only land at airports, the route for p1 will involve loading it onto an airplane, flying to the other city, and then loading it onto a truck. 

Given the constraints, p1 must visit location l2_3 in the second city and be in truck t2 at some point.

For p2, it's already at its target location but needs to be loaded onto airplane a2 at some point.

The plan we have already seems optimal under these constraints. Here is the revised, optimal plan:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
3. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
5. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
6. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
7. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
8. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
9. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
10. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
11. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
12. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
13. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
14. loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
15. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
16. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
17. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
18. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
19. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
20. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
21. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

But wait, I think there may be a simpler way to satisfy the constraints.

Constraint 1: p1 is in l1_2. This is already satisfied in the initial state.
Constraint 2: If p1 is in l1_2, then it needs to be in l2_3 at some point after. Since p1 is in l1_2 in the initial state, we need to ensure it visits l2_3.
Constraint 3: p2 is in a2 at some point.
Constraint 4: p1 is in t2 at some point.

Since p1 needs to be in l2_3 at some point, and l2_3 is in city c2, p1 has to be transported from city c1 to city c2. The most efficient way is via an airplane. Then, p1 needs to be transported back to city c1 to reach l1_5 (its goal). This roundtrip seems inevitable.

But I'm wondering if there's a shorter way to move p1 from l1_2 to l2_3 and back to l1_5. 

Let's try to re-optimize the plan...

Actually, the plan seems optimal as is. Let's stick with it. Here are the steps of the plan again with their intended consequences:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1 (Move t1 to p1's location)
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 (Load p1 onto t1)
3. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 (Drive t1 with p1 to the airport l1_1)
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (Unload p1 from t1 at the airport)
5. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (Load p1 onto a1)
6. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (Fly a1 with p1 to l2_1)
7. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 (Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1)
8. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (Load p1 onto t2, satisfying constraint 4)
9. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2 (Drive t2 with p1 to l2_3)
10. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (Unload p1 from t2 at l2_3, satisfying constraint 2)
11. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (Load p1 back onto t2)
12. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2 (Drive t2 with p1 back to the airport l2_1)
13. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (Unload p1 from t2 at the airport)
14. loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 (Load p1 onto a1)
15. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1 (Fly a1 with p1 back to l1_1)
16. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (Unload p1 from a1 at l1_1)
17. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (Load p1 onto t1)
18. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1 (Drive t1 with p1 to l1_5)
19. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 (Unload p1 from t1 at l1_5, satisfying the goal for p1)
20. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (Load p2 onto a2, satisfying constraint 3)
21. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (Unload p2 from a2 at l2_1, satisfying the goal for p2)

So, my final plan is as above. This plan is valid and satisfies all the constraints and goals.

Actually, I do have one redundancy to remove. We are moving a1 from l1_1 to l2_1 and then flying it back. There's actually no need to unload and reload p1 at l2_1. We could simply keep p1 in a1. So, the steps 7 to 16 can be replaced with:

7. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1 (Fly a1 back to l1_1 with p1 still inside)
8. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (Unload p1 from a1 at l1_1)

But this would not satisfy constraints 2 and 4. So, the original plan is indeed the most efficient given the constraints.

Final optimal plan is:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
3. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
5. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
6. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
7. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
8. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
9. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
10. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
11. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
12. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
13. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
14. loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
15. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
16. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
17. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
18. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
19. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
20. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
21. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
