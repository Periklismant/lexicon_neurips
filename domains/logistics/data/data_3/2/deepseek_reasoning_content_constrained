Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. First, I need to understand the initial state, the goal, and the constraints. 

The goal is to have p1 in l1_5 and p2 in l2_1. The initial state has p1 in l1_2 and p2 in l2_1. Wait, p2 is already in l2_1, so that part of the goal is already satisfied. But I need to make sure that during the plan execution, the constraints are met.

Constraints:
1. At least once, p1 must be in l1_2. Since that's its initial location, maybe that's already satisfied. But perhaps the problem wants it to be there again after moving? Wait, the initial state counts as a state. So maybe the first constraint is already met. But I need to confirm if the initial state counts. The problem says "must hold in at least one state", which includes the initial state. So that's already okay. But I need to check if the plan doesn't move p1 from l1_2 before the first state. Wait, the initial state is before any actions are taken, so the first constraint is satisfied. But let's see the other constraints.

2. If p1 is in l1_2 in some state s, then p1 must be in l2_3 at s or after. Since the initial state has p1 in l1_2, this triggers the requirement that p1 must be in l2_3 at some point after. But l2_3 is in city c2, which is a different city. So how can p1 get there? Probably using an airplane. But p1 starts in c1. So we need to move p1 from l1_2 to some airport in c1 (like l1_1), load it into an airplane, fly to c2's airport (l2_1), then move it to l2_3. But wait, the goal requires p1 to end up in l1_5. So this seems conflicting. Wait, no. The constraint says that if p1 is in l1_2 (which it is initially), then at some point after, p1 must be in l2_3. So we need to arrange that p1 goes from l1_2 to l2_3 and then back to c1's l1_5? That complicates things.

3. At least once, p2 must be in a2. So we need to load p2 into a2 at some point. But p2 starts in l2_1, and a2 is in l2_1 initially. So maybe load p2 into a2 and then unload it back to l2_1. That would satisfy the constraint.

4. At least once, p1 must be in t2. t2 is a truck. Where is t2? The initial state says "Package t2 is in location l2_1". Wait, no. Wait, the initial state lists "Package t1 is in location l1_4", "Package t2 is in location l2_1". Wait, that's a mistake. Wait, the objects include "truck t1" and "truck t2". So the initial state probably has the trucks in those locations. So "truck t1 is in l1_4" and "truck t2 is in l2_1". So t2 is in l2_1, which is in c2. So to get p1 into t2, p1 would need to be in c2. But p1 starts in c1. So how can p1 get into t2 (which is in c2)? That would require transporting p1 to c2, then loading it into t2. But the goal requires p1 to end up in l1_5 in c1. So this seems like a detour. Let's outline the steps needed.

First, for p1's constraints:

- Must be in l1_2 in some state (already true initially).
- Therefore, must be in l2_3 at some point after.
- Also, must be in t2 at some point.

So the plan must include moving p1 from l1_2 to l2_3, which requires:

1. Move p1 from l1_2 to l1_1 (airport in c1) via truck t1. Wait, t1 is in l1_4. So first, drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_2, load p1 into t1, then drive to l1_1. Then load into airplane a1 (which is in l1_1), fly to l2_1 (c2's airport), unload p1 into l2_1. Then, to get to l2_3, need a truck in c2. t2 is in l2_1. So drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_3, but wait, l2_3 is in c2. Wait, cities have their own locations. So in c2, locations are l2_1 (airport), l2_2, l2_3, etc. So t2 can drive from l2_1 to l2_3. So after p1 is in l2_1 (unloaded from airplane a1), load it into t2, drive t2 to l2_3, unload p1 there. That satisfies the constraint. Then, p1 needs to get back to c1's l1_5. So again, load into airplane (a2 is in l2_1? Wait, initial state says "Package a2 is in location l2_1". Wait, a2 is an airplane. So a2 is at l2_1 initially. So to fly p1 back, we need to load p1 into a2 at l2_1, fly to l1_1, then unload, then use a truck in c1 to take it to l1_5.

But let's check the steps:

For p1:

Initial: l1_2 (c1)

Need to get to l2_3 (c2), then back to l1_5 (c1).

Steps:

1. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_2 (c1). Load p1 into t1.

2. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1 (c1's airport). Unload p1 into l1_1.

3. Load p1 into a1 (which is at l1_1). Fly a1 to l2_1 (c2's airport). Unload p1 into l2_1.

4. Now, p1 is in l2_1 (c2). Need to get to l2_3. So load p1 into t2 (which is in l2_1). Then drive t2 to l2_3. Unload p1 there. Now, the constraint that p1 is in l2_3 is satisfied.

But then, to get p1 back to c1's l1_5:

5. Drive t2 back to l2_1 (if needed). Then load p1 into a2 (since a2 is in l2_1). Fly a2 to l1_1. Unload p1 there.

6. Then, use a truck in c1 (t1 is at l1_1 now?) Wait, t1 was driven to l1_1 earlier. So after step 2, t1 is at l1_1. Then in step 3, we load p1 into a1. So after step 3, t1 is still at l1_1. Then, after step 5, when a2 arrives at l1_1, unload p1, load into t1 (if t1 is still there). Then drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_5. Unload p1.

But let's track t1's location. After step 2, t1 is at l1_1. Then, steps 3-5 involve a1 and a2. So t1 remains at l1_1. So when p1 is unloaded from a2 at l1_1, we can load it into t1, drive to l1_5, unload.

So steps for p1:

- Steps 1-6 as above.

But this seems long. Let's see:

But also, the constraint that p1 must be in t2. So during step 4, when p1 is loaded into t2, that satisfies the fourth constraint. So step 4 is loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (after arriving in l2_1 via airplane), then drive t2 to l2_3, unload. Then, to get back, need to drive t2 back to l2_1? Or can we fly a2 from l2_3? No, because airplanes can only fly between airports. So l2_3 is not an airport. So p1 has to be moved back to l2_1 via t2, then loaded into a2, flown to l1_1, then loaded into t1, driven to l1_5.

Now for p2:

The goal is p2 in l2_1, which is already true initially. But the third constraint requires that p2 must be in a2 at some state. So we can load p2 into a2 and then unload it back. So:

Load p2 into a2 at l2_1 (since both are there), then unload. That would satisfy the constraint. But we need to do that in the plan.

Now, the problem is that p2 is already in l2_1, so the goal is already met. But the constraints require that p2 is in a2 at some point. So the plan must include loading and unloading p2 from a2.

Putting it all together:

Plan steps:

1. For p1:

   a. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_2 (drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1)

   b. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2

   c. Drive t1 to l1_1 (drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1)

   d. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

   e. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

   f. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

   g. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

   h. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (this satisfies constraint 4: p1 is in t2)

   i. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2

   j. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (now constraint 2 is satisfied: p1 is in l2_3 after being in l1_2)

   k. Now, need to get p1 back to c1's l1_5:

      - Drive t2 back to l2_1: drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

      - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (but p1 is in l2_3, so need to drive t2 to l2_3 first? Wait, after step j, p1 is in l2_3. So to get it back to l2_1, we need to drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1, load p1 into t2 again, then drive to l2_1. Wait, but after step j, t2 is in l2_3. So:

   k. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

   l. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (but p1 is in l2_3, which is a different location. So this won't work. Wait, after step j, p1 is in l2_3. So to load it into t2, t2 must be in l2_3. But after step i, t2 is driven to l2_3. Then step j unloads p1 there. So t2 is in l2_3. So after step j, t2 is in l2_3. So to get p1 back into t2, we need to load it again in l2_3. Then drive t2 back to l2_1.

Wait, step j: unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3. So after that, t2 is still in l2_3, and p1 is in l2_3.

So steps after j:

k. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (but p1 is in l2_3 and t2 is in l2_3)

l. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

m. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

n. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (a2 is here)

o. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

p. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

q. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (t1 is here from step c)

r. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1

s. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5

For p2:

Need to load into a2 and unload. So between steps n and o, we can have:

But wait, a2 is at l2_1 initially. So before step o (flying a2 to l1_1), we need to load p2 into a2 and then unload it. Let's see:

Let's insert steps for p2:

At some point before flying a2, load p2 into a2 and then unload.

But since the goal is p2 in l2_1, we can't move it elsewhere. So:

At l2_1, load p2 into a2 (loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1), then unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1. This way, p2 remains in l2_1, but the constraint that it was in a2 is satisfied.

So insert:

Between steps g and h (after a1 arrives at l2_1 and unloads p1):

But also, we need to handle p2. Let's see:

After step g (unload p1 from a1 into l2_1):

x. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

y. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

This way, p2 is loaded into a2 and then unloaded back to l2_1, satisfying constraint 3.

Now, putting all steps together:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1

2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2

3. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1

4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

5. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

6. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

7. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

8. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

9. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

10. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

11. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2

12. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

13. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

14. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

15. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

16. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

17. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

18. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

19. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

20. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1

21. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5

But wait, steps 8 and 9 handle p2. Let's check if this is necessary. Yes, because constraint 3 requires p2 to be in a2 at some state. So steps 8 and 9 are essential.

Now, check the constraints:

- Constraint 1: p1 in l1_2. Initial state has that, so it's satisfied.

- Constraint 2: If p1 is in l1_2 (initially true), then p1 must be in l2_3 at some state after. Steps 12 has p1 in l2_3, which is after the initial state. So satisfied.

- Constraint 3: p2 in a2. Step 8 loads p2 into a2. Then step 9 unloads. So in step 8, p2 is in a2. Satisfied.

- Constraint 4: p1 in t2. Step 10 loads p1 into t2. Satisfied.

Now, check if the plan is optimal. Are there any unnecessary steps? Let's see.

For example, after step 12, p1 is in l2_3. Then step 13 loads it back into t2 (which is in l2_3). Then drive to l2_1 (step14), unload (step15). Then load into a2 (step16), fly to l1_1, etc. That seems necessary.

But can we optimize steps 13-15? Let's see:

After step12, p1 is in l2_3. To get it back to l2_1, we need to load into t2 again. Because t2 is in l2_3 after step11 (drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3). Then step12 unloads p1 in l2_3. So t2 is still there. So step13: loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3. Then drive to l2_1 (step14). Then unload (step15). So yes, those steps are needed.

Alternatively, could we use another truck in c2? But the problem only lists t2 as a truck in c2 (since t2 is in l2_1 initially, which is in c2). So no other trucks available.

Another possible optimization: after step7, p1 is in l2_1. Then steps10-12 move it to l2_3. But the constraint requires that after p1 is in l1_2 (initial state), it must be in l2_3. So that's satisfied. Then, to get back to c1, perhaps there's a shorter path.

Wait, perhaps after step7, instead of moving p1 to l2_3, we could fly it back immediately. But no, because the constraint requires that p1 is in l2_3 at some point after being in l1_2. So we have to go through l2_3.

So this seems necessary.

Now, check if the plan is valid and meets all constraints.

Also, the goal is p1 in l1_5 and p2 in l2_1. p2 is unloaded back to l2_1 in step9, so that's fine. p1 is unloaded to l1_5 in step21.

Now, count the number of steps. 21 steps. Maybe there's a shorter way.

Wait, let's see: steps8 and9 are for p2. They are necessary. Let's see if they can be done earlier or later without conflict.

Alternatively, perhaps steps8 and9 can be done after step16, but then a2 would have to be available. Let me think.

But a2 is in l2_1 initially. So steps8 and9 can be done at any time when a2 is in l2_1. For example, before moving p1.

Wait, but p2 is in l2_1 initially. So steps8 and9 can be done at the very beginning, before any other actions. Let's see:

If we load p2 into a2 and unload right away, then proceed with p1's steps. That would allow a2 to be used later for transporting p1. Because after step9, a2 is back in l2_1, so can fly p1 later.

So reorganizing the plan:

1. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

2. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

Then proceed with p1's steps.

This way, steps8 and9 are moved to the start. Then, when we need to use a2 later (step16), it's available.

This reduces the total steps, as steps8 and9 are done early. Let's adjust the plan:

1. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

2. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

3. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1

4. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2

5. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1

6. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

7. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

8. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

9. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

10. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

11. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2

12. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

13. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

14. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

15. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

16. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

17. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

18. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

19. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

20. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1

21. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5

This way, the plan has 21 steps. But maybe steps can be optimized further.

Wait, after step14 (drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1), step15 unloads p1 in l2_1. But step13 loaded p1 into t2 in l2_3, then step14 drives to l2_1. So step15 unloads p1 into l2_1. Then step16 loads into a2 and flies to l1_1.

Alternatively, after step12 (unload p1 in l2_3), could we use another airplane to fly p1 back? But the only airplanes are a1 and a2. a1 is at l2_1 after step8. So a1 is in l2_1. To use a1 again, we could fly it back to l1_1, but that would require steps. Let me see.

Alternatively, after step9 (unload p1 in l2_1), instead of moving it to l2_3, perhaps use a2 to fly p1 back immediately. But that would not satisfy the constraint that p1 must be in l2_3 after being in l1_2.

So that's not possible. We have to take p1 to l2_3.

So the steps are necessary.

Another possible optimization: after step12, instead of reloading p1 into t2 and driving back, perhaps use another method. But there's no other truck in c2. So t2 is the only truck there.

Alternatively, maybe fly p1 from l2_3 to l2_1 using an airplane. But airplanes can only fly between airports. l2_3 is not an airport, so airplanes can't land there. So the only way to get p1 from l2_3 to l2_1 is via truck.

Thus, steps13-15 are necessary.

So the total steps are 21. But perhaps there's a shorter way.

Wait, let's think: After step12 (p1 in l2_3), can we fly a2 to l2_3? No, because l2_3 is not an airport. So no. So must use truck.

Another idea: When moving p1 to l2_3, perhaps keep it in the truck and drive back. Wait, but the constraint requires that p1 is in l2_3. So it must be unloaded there. Because the effect of unloadtruck is that p1 is situated in l2_3. So step12 is necessary.

Hmm. It seems that the steps are all necessary. Thus, the plan length is 21 actions. But maybe there's a way to combine steps or find a shorter path.

Wait, what if after step10 (load p1 into t2), drive t2 directly to l2_3, unload (step11-12), then drive back to l2_1 (steps13-14), but that's already accounted for.

Alternatively, after step10, can we fly p1 from l2_1 to l2_3? No, because airplanes can't fly to non-airports.

Another angle: The constraint that p1 must be in t2 can be satisfied during step10. So after step10, p1 is in t2. Then, the constraint is met. So perhaps we don't need to drive to l2_3 immediately. But the second constraint requires that after p1 is in l1_2 (initial state), it must be in l2_3 at some point. So even if we have p1 in t2 (in l2_1), we still need to get it to l2_3.

So steps10-12 are necessary.

Thus, the plan seems optimal. But let's check if any steps can be removed.

Wait, after step13, when we load p1 into t2 in l2_3, then drive to l2_1, then unload. Then load into a2 and fly back.

Alternatively, after step12 (p1 in l2_3), instead of loading into t2 again, perhaps use a different method. But there's no other truck. So no, must use t2.

Thus, the plan is valid and meets all constraints. Now, the final step count is 21 actions. But perhaps there's a shorter way.

Wait, let's think about the p2 steps. The initial state has p2 in l2_1, and we need to load it into a2 and unload. So steps1 and2:

1. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

2. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

That's two steps. These are necessary.

For p1:

- Move from l1_2 to l1_1 via t1: steps3-6.

- Fly to l2_1: steps7-9.

- Load into t2, drive to l2_3, unload: steps10-12.

- Load back into t2, drive to l2_1, unload: steps13-15.

- Fly back to l1_1: steps16-18.

- Drive to l1_5: steps19-21.

That's 21 steps. Is there any way to shorten this?

Wait, when returning p1 to c1, after step15 (p1 in l2_1), load into a2 and fly to l1_1. Then, use t1 (which is at l1_1 from step5) to drive to l1_5. So steps19-21 are correct.

But what if t1 is already at l1_1? Yes, after step5, t1 is driven to l1_1. So steps19-21 are needed.

Alternatively, could we have t1 drive directly from l1_1 to l1_5 after step6? No, because in step5, t1 is driven to l1_1, and in step6, p1 is unloaded there. So t1 remains at l1_1. Then, after step18, p1 is unloaded at l1_1, and loaded into t1 (step19), then driven to l1_5.

Yes.

Is there a way to combine some steps? For example, after step18 (unload p1 from a2 into l1_1), can we immediately load into t1 and drive to l1_5? Yes, that's what steps19-21 do.

So perhaps this is the optimal plan. Let's check for any redundant steps.

Another observation: The initial position of t1 is l1_4. To get p1 from l1_2, t1 needs to move to l1_2. Then to l1_1. So steps3 and5 are necessary.

I think this plan is optimal. It meets all constraints and achieves the goal. Now, let's write it in the required format.
