First, let me carefully analyze and organize the given information.

**Problem Domain:** Logistics involving trucks, airplanes, and packages moving between cities and locations.

**Actions:**
- `loadtruck p t l`: Load package p in truck t at location l
- `loadairplane p ap l`: Load package p in airplane ap at location l
- `unloadtruck p t l`: Unload package p from truck t at location l
- `unloadairplane p ap l`: Unload package p from airplane ap at location l
- `drivetruck t l_from l_to c`: Drive truck t from location l_from to l_to in city c
- `flyairplane ap l_from l_to`: Fly airplane ap from location l_from to l_to

**Objects:**
- Locations: l1_1 (airport), l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5, l2_1 (airport), l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5
- Cities: c1, c2
- Packages: p1, p2
- Trucks: t1, t2
- Airplanes: a1, a2

**Initial State:**
- l1_1, l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5 are in city c1
- l2_1, l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5 are in city c2
- t1 is in location l1_2
- t2 is in location l2_1
- p1 is in location l2_1
- p2 is in location l2_2
- a1 is in location l1_1
- a2 is in location l2_1

Hmm, I see some issues with the initial state. It refers to packages t1, t2, a1, and a2, but these should be trucks and airplanes, not packages. Let me interpret this correctly:

**Initial State (corrected):**
- l1_1, l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5 are in city c1
- l2_1, l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5 are in city c2
- Truck t1 is in location l1_2
- Truck t2 is in location l2_1
- Package p1 is in location l2_1
- Package p2 is in location l2_2
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

**Goal State:**
- p1 is in location l1_2
- p2 is in location l2_1

**Constraints:**
1. At some point, p1 must be in either l2_4 or l1_4
2. At some point, p2 must be in l2_2 (this is already satisfied in the initial state)
3. If p2 is in l2_2, then p1 must be in l2_1 either at the same time or sometime after
4. At some point, p1 must be in l1_1
5. If p1 is in l1_1, then p2 must have been in l1_4 at some earlier state

Now let's plan the sequence of actions that satisfies the goal and all constraints.

First, I need to analyze the constraints to understand the ordering requirements:

- Constraint 3 says that after p2 is in l2_2, p1 must be in l2_1 at the same time or later.
- Since p2 starts in l2_2 and p1 starts in l2_1, this constraint is initially satisfied.
- Constraint 5 says that before p1 is in l1_1, p2 must have been in l1_4.

Given these constraints, here's how I need to sequence events:
1. First, get p2 to l1_4 (this is necessary for constraint 5)
2. Then, get p1 to l1_1 (for constraint 4)
3. At some point, p1 must visit either l2_4 or l1_4 (for constraint 1)
4. Finally, get p1 to l1_2 and p2 to l2_1 (the goal)

Let me create a plan step-by-step:

**Step 1: Get p2 to l1_4**
- Load p2 into truck t2 at l2_2 (need to move t2 from l2_1 to l2_2 first)
- Transport p2 to airport l2_1
- Load p2 into airplane a2
- Fly a2 to airport l1_1
- Unload p2 from a2
- Load p2 into truck t1 (need to move t1 from l1_2 to l1_1 first)
- Drive t1 to l1_4
- Unload p2 at l1_4

**Step 2: Get p1 to l2_4 or l1_4 (for constraint 1)**
- Since p1 starts at l2_1, we can move it to l2_4 using t2
- Load p1 into t2 at l2_1
- Drive t2 to l2_4
- Unload p1 at l2_4

**Step 3: Get p1 to l1_1 (for constraint 4)**
- Load p1 into t2 at l2_4
- Drive t2 to l2_1
- Unload p1 at l2_1
- Load p1 into a2
- Fly a2 to l1_1
- Unload p1 at l1_1

**Step 4: Final goal - get p1 to l1_2 and p2 to l2_1**
- Load p1 into t1 at l1_1
- Drive t1 to l1_2
- Unload p1 at l1_2
- Load p2 into t1 at l1_4
- Drive t1 to l1_1
- Unload p2 at l1_1
- Load p2 into a2
- Fly a2 to l2_1
- Unload p2 at l2_1

Let me double-check this plan against constraints:
1. p1 goes to l2_4 ✓
2. p2 starts at l2_2 ✓
3. After p2 is in l2_2, p1 is in l2_1 (initially) ✓
4. p1 goes to l1_1 ✓
5. Before p1 is in l1_1, p2 is in l1_4 ✓

Now let me formalize the complete plan with the correct action formats:

Hold on, I think I made a planning error. I need to be more careful about the location of vehicles in the initial state. Let me re-plan from the beginning.

**Initial State:**
- Truck t1 is in location l1_2 (city c1)
- Truck t2 is in location l2_1 (city c2)
- Package p1 is in location l2_1 (city c2)
- Package p2 is in location l2_2 (city c2)
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (city c1)
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1 (city c2)

First, let's verify that the constraints are compatible with each other:
1. p1 must visit l2_4 or l1_4
2. p2 must visit l2_2 (already satisfied initially)
3. After p2 is in l2_2, p1 must be in l2_1 (already satisfied initially)
4. p1 must visit l1_1
5. Before p1 visits l1_1, p2 must visit l1_4

These constraints seem compatible. Now let's create a step-by-step plan:

1. Move p2 from l2_2 to l1_4 (needed for constraint 5)
   - Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2
   - Load p2 into t2 at l2_2
   - Drive t2 back to l2_1
   - Load p2 into airplane a2 at l2_1
   - Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1
   - Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1
   - Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1
   - Load p2 into t1 at l1_1
   - Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_4
   - Unload p2 from t1 at l1_4

2. Move p1 from l2_1 to a location that satisfies constraint 1 (l2_4)
   - Load p1 into t2 at l2_1
   - Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4
   - Unload p1 from t2 at l2_4
   - Drive t2 from l2_4 back to l2_1

3. Move p1 to l1_1 (constraint 4)
   - Load p1 into t2 at l2_4
   - Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1
   - Load p1 into a2 at l2_1 (we need to fly a2 back from l1_1 first)
   - Fly a2 from l1_1 to l2_1
   - Load p1 into a2 at l2_1
   - Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1
   - Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1

4. Move p1 to its final destination (l1_2)
   - Load p1 into t1 at l1_1
   - Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_2
   - Unload p1 from t1 at l1_2

5. Move p2 to its final destination (l2_1)
   - Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_4
   - Load p2 into t1 at l1_4
   - Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1
   - Load p2 into a2 at l1_1
   - Fly a2 from l1_1 to l2_1
   - Unload p2 from a2 at l2_1

Now let me formalize the complete plan:

Hmm, I notice there are still inconsistencies in my plan. Let me list the specific sequences of actions more carefully.

**Initial State:**
- Truck t1 is in location l1_2 (city c1)
- Truck t2 is in location l2_1 (city c2)
- Package p1 is in location l2_1 (city c2)
- Package p2 is in location l2_2 (city c2)
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (city c1)
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1 (city c2)

Let me create the plan step by step, carefully tracking the location of each object:

1. First, get p2 from l2_2 to l1_4 (for constraint 5):
   - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
   - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
   - drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
   - loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
   - flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
   - unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
   - drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
   - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
   - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

2. Next, get p1 to l2_4 (for constraint 1):
   - flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
   - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
   - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
   - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

3. Get p1 to l1_1 (for constraint 4):
   - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
   - drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
   - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
   - loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
   - flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
   - unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

4. Get p1 to its final destination (l1_2):
   - drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
   - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
   - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
   - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2

5. Get p2 back to its final destination (l2_1):
   - drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1
   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
   - drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
   - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
   - loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
   - flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
   - unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

This plan satisfies:
- Goal: p1 in l1_2, p2 in l2_1
- Constraint 1: p1 visits l2_4
- Constraint 2: p2 is in l2_2 (initially)
- Constraint 3: After p2 is in l2_2, p1 is in l2_1 (initially)
- Constraint 4: p1 visits l1_1
- Constraint 5: Before p1 is in l1_1, p2 visits l1_4

However, I realize that I made an error with the `loadairplane` action. In the unloading case, it should be `unloadairplane`. Let me fix that:

I see another issue in my implementation. I need to make sure that after p2 is in l2_2, p1 must be in l2_1 at the same time or later. Since both conditions are true in the initial state, this constraint is already satisfied. However, I need to ensure that when I move p2 from l2_2, p1 is still in l2_1 or has been there afterward.

Let me correct my plan:

Hmm, actually, I realize my thinking was correct. The constraint says "If p2 is in l2_2, then p1 must be in l2_1 at the same time or after." In the initial state, p2 is in l2_2 and p1 is in l2_1, so the constraint is satisfied. After I move p2 from l2_2, the condition "p2 is in l2_2" no longer holds, so the constraint no longer applies.

Let me finalize the complete plan:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
4. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
5. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
6. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
7. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
8. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
9. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
10. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
11. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
12. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
13. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
14. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
15. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
16. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
17. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
18. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
19. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
20. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
21. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
22. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
23. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
24. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
25. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1
26. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
27. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
28. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
29. loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
30. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
31. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

That's 31 steps. Let me see if I can optimize it further.

It seems like I'm retracing some steps unnecessarily. Let me try to be more efficient:

I'm spending extra steps with the trucks. For example, I can avoid taking p1 out of truck t2 just to reload it. Let me replan:

**Optimized Plan:**

1. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
4. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
5. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
6. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
7. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
8. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
9. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
10. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
11. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
12. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
13. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
14. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
15. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
16. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
17. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
18. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
19. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
20. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
21. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
22. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
23. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1
24. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
25. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
26. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
27. loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
28. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
29. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

I noticed that step 17 assumes p1 has been unloaded from t2 at l2_1, but I didn't explicitly include that step. Let me add it:

16. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
17. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
18. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

So the corrected plan is:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
4. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
5. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
6. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
7. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
8. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
9. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
10. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
11. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
12. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
13. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
14. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
15. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
16. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
17. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
18. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
19. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
20. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
21. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
22. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
23. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
24. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1
25. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
26. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
27. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
28. loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
29. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
30. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

This is 30 steps. I think I can optimize it further. For instance, I'm doing steps 14-15 (unload and load p1 at l2_4) which seems redundant. Let me fix that:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
4. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
5. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
6. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
7. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
8. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
9. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
10. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
11. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
12. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
13. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
14. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
15. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
16. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
17. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
18. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
19. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
20. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
21. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1
22. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
23. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
24. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
25. loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
26. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
27. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

But wait, this doesn't satisfy constraint 1 anymore. p1 needs to be in l2_4 or l1_4 at some point. I removed the unloading at l2_4, which breaks this constraint. Let me restore it:

13. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
14. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
15. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
16. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2

Now I have 29 steps. Let me check if there are other optimizations:

I see that I'm doing multiple loads and unloads that aren't necessary. For example, I load p1 into t2, drive to l2_4, unload, reload, and drive back to l2_1. I could just drive to l2_4 and back without unloading/reloading if I only need p1 to visit l2_4.

Let me optimize one more time:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
5. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
6. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
7. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
8. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
9. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
10. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
11. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
12. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
13. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
14. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
15. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
16. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
17. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
18. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
19. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
20. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
21. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
22. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
23. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1
24. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
25. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
26. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
27. loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
28. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
29. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

But I still don't have p1 fully satisfying constraint 1. Let me double-check:

Constraint 1: p1 must visit l2_4 or l1_4
- In steps 13-15, I load p1 into t2, drive to l2_4, then drive back to l2_1 without unloading. Does this count as p1 "visiting" l2_4? To be safe, I should unload p1 at l2_4 to ensure it's physically at the location.

Let me revert to the previous plan with 29 steps, which explicitly unloads and loads p1 at l2_4.

Actually, on second thought, I believe I need to unload p1 at l2_4 to satisfy the constraint. The constraint specifically states "Package p1 is in location l2_4", which would only be true if p1 is physically at the location, not inside a truck that's at that location.

So, I'll use the version with 29 steps:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
5. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
6. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
7. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
8. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
9. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
10. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
11. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
12. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
13. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
14. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
15. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
16. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
17. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
18. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
19. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
20. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
21. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
22. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
23. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
24. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
25. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1
26. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
27. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
28. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
29. loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
30. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
31. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

That's 31 steps.

Actually, let me double-check if I'm executing an unnecessary unload/load sequence. Step 4 unloads p2 from t2 at l2_1, and then step 5 loads it onto a2. This is necessary since we're switching vehicles.

I think the plan is now correct and optimized.

Let me check all the transitions in the plan to ensure it's correct and optimized:

Starting state:
- t1 at l1_2
- t2 at l2_1
- p1 at l2_1
- p2 at l2_2
- a1 at l1_1
- a2 at l2_1

After 1 (drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2):
- t1 at l1_2
- t2 at l2_2
- p1 at l2_1
- p2 at l2_2
- a1 at l1_1
- a2 at l2_1

After 2 (loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2):
- t1 at l1_2
- t2 at l2_2
- p1 at l2_1
- p2 in t2
- a1 at l1_1
- a2 at l2_1

After 3 (drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2):
- t1 at l1_2
- t2 at l2_1
- p1 at l2_1
- p2 in t2
- a1 at l1_1
- a2 at l2_1

After 4 (unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1):
- t1 at l1_2
- t2 at l2_1
- p1 at l2_1
- p2 at l2_1
- a1 at l1_1
- a2 at l2_1

After 5 (loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1):
- t1 at l1_2
- t2 at l2_1
- p1 at l2_1

After 22 (loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1):
This doesn't work because t1 is at l1_4 and p1 is at l1_1. I need to drive t1 to l1_1 first.

Let me fix the plan:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
5. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
6. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
7. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
8. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
9. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
10. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
11. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
12. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
13. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
14. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
15. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
16. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
17. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
18. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
19. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
20. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
21. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
22. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
23. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
24. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
25. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
26. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1
27. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
28. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
29. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
30. loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
31. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
32. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

That's 32 steps.

Let me check if I can optimize this. In particular, I believe steps 25-26 can be removed because I actually only need p1 at l1_2 at the end, I don't need to go back to l1_4.

Also, step 22 shouldn't be necessary because we can load p1 onto t1 at l1_1 immediately after step 21. Let me re-check:

After 21 (unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1):
- t1 at l1_4
- t2 at l2_1
- p1 at l1_1
- p2 at l1_4
- a1 at l1_1
- a2 at l1_1

So t1 is at l1_4 and p1 is at l1_1. To load p1 onto t1, I indeed need step 22 to move t1 to l1_1. 

Let me try again with a slightly different plan:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
5. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
6. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
7. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
8. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
9. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
10. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
11. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
12. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
13. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
14. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
15. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
16. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
17. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
18. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
19. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
20. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
21. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
22. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 # This won't work because t1 is at l1_4 and p1 is at l1_1

Let me think about this differently. Let me reconsider the entire problem and see if I can find a more efficient plan.

We need:
1. p1 to end up at l1_2
2. p2 to end up at l2_1
3. p1 must visit either l2_4 or l1_4
4. p2 must visit l2_2 (already satisfied in the initial state)
5. If p2 is in l2_2, p1 must be in l2_1 (already satisfied in the initial state)
6. p1 must visit l1_1
7. Before p1 visits l1_1, p2 must visit l1_4

Given these requirements, let me create a new plan:

1. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_1
2. Drive t2 to l2_4 (satisfying constraint 3)
3. Drive t2 back to l2_1
4. Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1
5. Fly a2 to l1_1
6. (Meanwhile, drive t1 to l1_1)
7. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_2
8. Drive t2 to l2_1
9. Drive t2 to l2_1
10. Load p2 onto a2 at l2_1
11. Fly a2 to l1_1
12. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_1
13. Drive t1 to l1_4 (satisfying constraint 7)
14. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1 (satisfying constraint 6)
15. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_1
16. Drive t1 to l1_2
17. Unload p1 at l1_2 (satisfying the goal for p1)
18. Drive t1 back to l1_4
19. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_4
20. Drive t1 to l1_1
21. Load p2 onto a2 at l1_1
22. Fly a2 to l2_1
23. Unload p2 at l2_1 (satisfying the goal for p2)

Let me try to formalize this plan:

1. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
2. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
3. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
5. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
6. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
7. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
8. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
9. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
10. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
11. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
12. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
13. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
14. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
15. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
16. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
17. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1 # Oops, a2 is already at l1_1. These actions are inconsistent.

I think I'm confusing myself with my own plans. Let me start over and be more methodical.

**Initial State:**
- t1 at l1_2 (city c1)
- t2 at l2_1 (city c2)
- p1 at l2_1 (city c2)
- p2 at l2_2 (city c2)
- a1 at l1_1 (city c1)
- a2 at l2_1 (city c2)

**Requirements:**
1. p1 must end up at l1_2
2. p2 must end up at l2_1
3. p1 must visit either l2_4 or l1_4
4. p2 must visit l2_2 (already true initially)
5. If p2 is in l2_2, p1 must be in l2_1 (already true initially)
6. p1 must visit l1_1
7. Before p1 visits l1_1, p2 must visit l1_4

Let me create a concise plan for moving p1 and p2 to satisfy all requirements:

1. First, we need to get p2 to l1_4 (for requirement 7)
   - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
   - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
   - drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
   - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
   - loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
   - flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
   - unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
   - drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
   - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
   - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

2. Now we can move p1 to l1_1 (for requirement 6)
   - flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
   - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
   - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2 (satisfying requirement 3)
   - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
   - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
   - drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
   - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
   - loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
   - flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
   - unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

3. Move p1 to its final destination (l1_2)
   - drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
   - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
   - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
   - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2

4. Move p2 to its final destination (l2_1)
   - drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1
   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
   - drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
   - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
   - loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
   - flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
   - unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

That's 32 steps total. Let me review the plan to see if it's optimal:

For satisfying the goal and all constraints, we need:
1. p2 to start at l2_2, go to l1_4, and end at l2_1
2. p1 to start at l2_1, visit l2_4, visit l1_1, and end at l1_2
3. p1 can only visit l1_1 after p2 has visited l1_4

My plan follows this sequence:
- First, move p2 from l2_2 to l1_4
- Then, move p1 from l2_1 to l2_4, then to l1_1
- Then, move p1 from l1_1 to l1_2
- Finally, move p2 from l1_4 to l2_1

I don't see any redundant steps or ways to optimize further. 32 steps seem to be the minimum required given the constraints.

One minor optimization: In step 15, we unload and reload p1 at l2_4. I think this is necessary to satisfy the constraint that p1 visits l2_4. If we kept p1 in the truck, it wouldn't technically be "at" l2_4.

Let me finalize the plan:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
5. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
6. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
7. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
8. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
9. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
10. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
11. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
12. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
13. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
14. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
15. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
16. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
17. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
18. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
19. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
20. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
21. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
22. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
23. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
24. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
25. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
26. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1
27. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
28. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
29. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
30. loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
31. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
32. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

Final validation:
- This plan satisfies the goal: p1 at l1_2, p2 at l2_1
- It satisfies constraint 1: p1 visits l2_4
- It satisfies constraint 2: p2 visits l2_2 (already true initially)
- It satisfies constraint 3: When p2 is at l2_2, p1 is at l2_1 (initially)
- It satisfies constraint 4: p1 visits l1_1
- It satisfies constraint 5: Before p1 visits l1_1, p2 visits l1_4

So this is a valid, optimized plan with 32 steps.
