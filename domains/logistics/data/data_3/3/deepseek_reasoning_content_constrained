Okay, let's try to figure out how to solve this planning problem. So, the goal is to get package p1 to l1_2 and p2 to l2_1, but there are a bunch of constraints we have to satisfy along the way. Let's start by understanding the initial state and the constraints.

First, the initial state:

- Locations:
  - c1 has l1_1 (airport), l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5.
  - c2 has l2_1 (airport), l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5.
  
- Packages and vehicles:
  - t1 (truck) is in l1_2 (city c1).
  - t2 (truck) is in l2_1 (city c2).
  - p1 is in l2_1 (c2's airport).
  - p2 is in l2_2 (city c2).
  - a1 (airplane) is in l1_1 (c1's airport).
  - a2 (airplane) is in l2_1 (c2's airport).

The goal is to have p1 in l1_2 (c1) and p2 in l2_1 (c2's airport). 

Constraints:

1. At some point, p1 must be in l2_4 or l1_4.
2. At some point, p2 must be in l2_2. But wait, initially p2 is already in l2_2. So maybe that's automatically satisfied. But maybe the constraint requires it to be in l2_2 again after some movement? Hmm, need to check. The problem says "must hold in at least one state", so if p2 is already there in the initial state, then this is satisfied. But maybe if p2 moves and then returns, but the problem doesn't specify that. So maybe this constraint is already met. Wait, but the initial state has p2 in l2_2, so unless it's moved and then comes back, but perhaps the constraint is satisfied from the start. So maybe we don't need to do anything for that. But we have to be careful because another constraint says that if p2 is in l2_2 in some state, then p1 must be in l2_1 at that state or after. But since p2 starts in l2_2, that's a state (initial) where p2 is in l2_2. So then, according to the third constraint, in that state or after, p1 must be in l2_1. But p1 starts in l2_1. So maybe that's okay. Wait, but the third constraint says if p2 is in l2_2 in some state s, then p1 must be in l2_1 at s or after. But in the initial state, s0, p2 is in l2_2 and p1 is in l2_1. So that's already satisfied. So maybe the third constraint is already satisfied. But perhaps during the plan, if p2 is moved back to l2_2, then we need to ensure that p1 is in l2_1 at that point or after. So maybe that's okay.

Next, the fourth constraint: p1 must be in l1_1 at some state. And the fifth constraint: if p1 is in l1_1 in some state, there must be an earlier state where p2 is in l1_4. But l1_4 is in city c1, and p2 starts in c2. So we need to get p2 to l1_4 at some point before p1 is in l1_1. That seems challenging because p2 is in c2's l2_2, and how to move it to c1's l1_4. Since trucks can't move between cities, only airplanes can. So we might need to load p2 into an airplane in c2, fly it to c1's airport, then use a truck to move it to l1_4.

But the problem is that the trucks in c1 are t1 (in l1_2) and in c2 is t2 (in l2_1). So to move p2 from c2 to c1, we need to:

1. Load p2 into a truck in c2 (t2 is in l2_1, but p2 is in l2_2. So first, drive t2 to l2_2, load p2, drive to l2_1 (airport), then load into airplane a2, fly to l1_1 (c1's airport), unload into a1 (but a1 is already in l1_1), then load into t1 (but t1 is in l1_2). Wait, but t1 is in l1_2. So maybe drive t1 to l1_1 (airport), load p2 from airplane into t1, then drive to l1_4. Then unload p2 there. That would satisfy the fifth constraint's requirement that p2 is in l1_4 before p1 is in l1_1.

But p1's goal is to be in l1_2. So maybe after moving p2 to l1_4, we need to get p1 to l1_1. Wait, but how? Let's think.

But let's outline the steps:

For p1: starts in l2_1 (c2's airport). To get to l1_2 (c1's city), we need to fly it from l2_1 to l1_1 using airplane a2 (since a2 is in l2_1). So load p1 into a2 at l2_1, fly to l1_1, unload p1 into l1_1. Then use truck t1 (which is in l1_2) to drive to l1_1, load p1, drive back to l1_2, unload. But wait, t1 is in l1_2 initially. So to load p1 into t1, t1 needs to be at l1_1. So drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1, load p1, then drive back to l1_2 and unload.

But during this process, we need to satisfy the first constraint: p1 must be in l2_4 or l1_4 at some state. So perhaps during the movement of p1, we can route it through l1_4. But how? If p1 is in l1_1, then to get to l1_2, maybe via l1_4? Wait, the cities' locations are connected by trucks. So trucks can drive between any locations in their city. So from l1_1 to l1_2, can the truck go directly, or do they need to go through other locations? The problem doesn't specify any restrictions on truck movement other than they can move between locations in the same city. So a truck can drive from any location to any other in the same city. So t1 can drive from l1_2 to l1_1 directly, load p1, then drive back to l1_2. But in that case, p1 is never in l1_4. So to satisfy the first constraint, we need to have p1 in either l2_4 or l1_4. Since p1 starts in l2_1, maybe we can take it to l2_4 before flying it to c1.

Alternatively, after flying to c1's airport l1_1, maybe take a detour via l1_4. Let's think.

Wait, the first constraint is that p1 must be in l2_4 or l1_4 at least once. So if we take p1 from l2_1 to l2_4 (using truck t2 in c2), but t2 is in l2_1. So to do that:

- Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4 (possible, since they are in the same city c2). Then load p1 into t2 (but p1 is in l2_1, which is where t2 starts). Wait, initial state: p1 is in l2_1. So t2 is in l2_1. So we can load p1 into t2 at l2_1, drive t2 to l2_4, unload p1 there. Then load it into airplane a2 (but a2 is in l2_1, so t2 would need to go back to l2_1). Wait, but if we drive t2 to l2_4, unload p1 there (so p1 is in l2_4, satisfying the first constraint), then maybe fly a2 to l2_4? But a2 is an airplane; can it fly to l2_4? Wait, airplanes can only fly between airports. So l2_4 is not an airport (airports are l1_1 and l2_1). So that's not possible. So perhaps, to get p1 to l2_4, we need to use a truck in c2. But after moving p1 to l2_4 via t2, how to get it back to an airport to fly it to c1. That complicates things.

Alternatively, maybe after flying p1 to c1's airport l1_1, we can use truck t1 to take it to l1_4. For example:

- Fly p1 to l1_1 (using a2 from l2_1 to l1_1).
- Then, drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1, load p1 into t1, drive t1 to l1_4, unload p1 there (satisfying the first constraint), then drive back to l1_2 and unload. But this adds steps but allows the constraint to be met.

But the problem requires an optimal plan (shortest possible). So maybe this approach is longer. Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to satisfy the constraints without adding too many steps.

Wait, the first constraint requires p1 to be in l2_4 or l1_4. Let's see which is easier. If we can get p1 to l1_4, that's in c1, which is where it needs to end up in l1_2. So perhaps after flying p1 to l1_1, use t1 to drive to l1_4, unload, then to l1_2. But that would require:

1. Fly p1 from l2_1 to l1_1 (a2 flies there).
2. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1 (load p1).
3. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_4 (unload p1 there, satisfying the constraint).
4. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_2 (unload p1 there).

That's four steps for p1's movement. But maybe that's necessary.

But also, we need to handle p2's movement. The goal is for p2 to be in l2_1. Currently, p2 is in l2_2. So we need to move it from l2_2 to l2_1. Since l2_1 is an airport in c2, and t2 is in l2_1 initially. Wait, no: initial state says "Package t2 is in location l2_1". Wait, wait, the initial state has:

- "Package t1 is in location l1_2"
- "Package t2 is in location l2_1"
- "Package p1 is in location l2_1"
- "Package p2 is in location l2_2"
- "Package a1 is in location l1_1"
- "Package a2 is in location l2_1"

Wait, but t1 and t2 are trucks, right? The problem statement says "truck t1", "truck t2". So the initial state mentions their locations. So t1 is in l1_2 (c1), t2 is in l2_1 (c2). So for p2, which is in l2_2 (c2), to get to l2_1 (c2's airport), we can use t2. But t2 is in l2_1. So t2 needs to drive to l2_2, load p2, then drive back to l2_1 and unload. That would be:

1. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
2. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
3. Drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
4. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

But that's four actions. However, p2's goal is to be in l2_1. So this would work. But the third constraint says that if in some state p2 is in l2_2, then p1 must be in l2_1 at that state or after. But in the initial state, p2 is in l2_2, and p1 is in l2_1. So that's already satisfied. But when we move p2 from l2_2 to l2_1, during the process, when we load p2 into t2 in l2_2, then p2 is in t2, so it's no longer in l2_2. So the constraint is about p2 being in l2_2 in some state. The initial state already has that, so perhaps the third constraint is already satisfied. However, if during the plan, p2 is moved back to l2_2, then we need to ensure that p1 is in l2_1 at that time or after.

But the fifth constraint: if p1 is in l1_1 in some state, there must be an earlier state where p2 is in l1_4. So we need to get p2 to l1_4 (c1's location) before p1 is in l1_1. But p2 starts in c2. So to get p2 to l1_4, we need to:

1. Move p2 from l2_2 to l2_1 (using t2 as before).
2. Load p2 into airplane a2 at l2_1.
3. Fly a2 to l1_1 (c1's airport).
4. Unload p2 from a2 into l1_1.
5. Load p2 into truck t1 (but t1 is in l1_2, so drive t1 to l1_1 first).
6. Drive t1 to l1_4 and unload p2 there.

That's a lot of steps, but necessary to satisfy the fifth constraint. Then, after p2 is in l1_4, we can have p1 in l1_1 (maybe by flying it there). But p1's goal is l1_2, so after getting to l1_1, need to move it to l1_2.

But let's outline all the steps needed considering all constraints.

First, let's handle the fifth constraint: if p1 is in l1_1, there must be a prior state where p2 is in l1_4. So to get p1 to l1_1 (even temporarily), we need to have p2 in l1_4 before that.

So the plan must include:

- Moving p2 to l1_4.
- Then moving p1 to l1_1.

But p1's goal is l1_2. So perhaps we can fly p1 to l1_1, then use t1 to take it to l1_2. But during that, if p1 is in l1_1, we need to have had p2 in l1_4 earlier.

So steps for p2 to get to l1_4:

1. Move p2 from l2_2 to l2_1 (using t2).
   - Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
   - Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
   - Drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
   - Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

But after this, p2 is in l2_1 (which is its goal). But according to the problem's goal, we need p2 to be in l2_1. So maybe we need to do this after moving p2 to l1_4. Wait, but how? Because if we move p2 to l1_4, we have to then move it back to l2_1. But that's conflicting with the goal. Wait, the goal is for p2 to be in l2_1. So perhaps the plan is:

- Move p2 from l2_2 to l2_1 (achieving the goal), but before that, we have to move p2 to l1_4 to satisfy the fifth constraint. But that's impossible because the goal requires p2 to be in l2_1, and the fifth constraint requires that if p1 is in l1_1 at any point, then p2 must have been in l1_4 before. So perhaps the solution is to move p2 to l1_4, then move it back to l2_1, ensuring that before p1 is in l1_1, p2 was in l1_4.

But that seems complicated. Let's think step by step.

First, handle p2's movement to l1_4:

- Load p2 into t2 in l2_2 (need t2 to drive there).
   - Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
   - Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
   - Drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
   - Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (but this puts p2 back in l2_1, which is its goal. But we need to get p2 to l1_4. So maybe after loading p2 into t2 and driving to l2_1, instead of unloading, load it into a2, fly to l1_1, then unload into a1 (but a1 is already in l1_1), then load into t1, drive to l1_4, unload. Then fly back to l2_1, and unload into l2_1.

Wait, but a2 is in l2_1. So steps for moving p2 to l1_4:

1. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
2. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
3. Drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
4. Loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (since a2 is in l2_1)
5. Flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
6. Unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (now p2 is in l1_1)
7. Drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
8. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
9. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
10. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (now p2 is in l1_4, satisfying the fifth constraint's earlier state)
11. Then, to get p2 back to l2_1, we need to:
    - Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
    - Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (Wait, but after step 10, p2 is in l1_4. To move it back to l2_1, we need to load it into an airplane again.)
    - Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (but t1 is in l1_4 after step 9)
    - Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
    - Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
    - Loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (assuming a1 is in l1_1)
    - Flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
    - Unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (now p2 is back in l2_1, achieving the goal)

But this is a lot of steps. However, the fifth constraint requires that if p1 is in l1_1, then p2 must have been in l1_4 before. So if during the plan, p1 is moved through l1_1, we need to ensure that p2 was in l1_4 before that.

But in the initial steps for p1, we might fly it from l2_1 to l1_1. So in that case, before that flight, p2 must be in l1_4. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the plan can be structured such that p2 is moved to l1_4 before p1 is flown to l1_1.

But this is getting quite complex. Let's try to outline the steps in order.

First, handle the fifth constraint by moving p2 to l1_4:

Steps for p2 to l1_4:

1. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2 (c2): drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
2. Load p2 into t2 at l2_2: loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
3. Drive t2 back to l2_1: drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
4. Unload p2 at l2_1: unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (but this would put p2 back where it started, which is not helpful. Instead, after step 3, p2 is in t2 at l2_1. Then, load it into airplane a2: loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
5. Fly a2 to l1_1: flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
6. Unload p2 from a2 into l1_1: unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
7. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1: drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
8. Load p2 into t1: loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
9. Drive t1 to l1_4: drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
10. Unload p2 at l1_4: unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (now p2 is in l1_4, satisfying the fifth constraint's requirement that p2 is there before p1 is in l1_1)

Now, p2 is in l1_4. We need to move it back to l2_1 to meet the goal. So:

11. Drive t1 back to l1_1: drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
12. Unload p2 (if still in truck? Wait, after step 10, p2 is in l1_4, so step 11 is driving empty. So to get p2 back, we need to load it into t1 again.

Wait, no: after step 10, p2 is in l1_4. To move it back, we need to load it into t1 again. So:

11. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
12. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
13. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
14. Loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (a1 is in l1_1)
15. Flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
16. Unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (now p2 is back in l2_1, achieving its goal)

But this is a lot of steps. However, we need to do this to satisfy the fifth constraint.

Now, handling p1's movement:

Initial location: l2_1 (c2's airport). Goal: l1_2 (c1). To get there, p1 can be loaded into a2, flown to l1_1, then loaded into t1 and driven to l1_2.

But during this process, when p1 is in l1_1 (after unloading from airplane), we need to ensure that p2 was in l1_4 before that. According to our steps above, p2 is in l1_4 at step 10. Then, moving p1 to l1_1 would be after step 6 (unloading p2 into l1_1). Wait, no. Let me clarify the order of steps.

Wait, the steps for p2 to get to l1_4 are steps 1-10. Then, steps 11-16 move p2 back to l2_1. Then, after that, we can move p1.

But the fifth constraint requires that if p1 is in l1_1 at any state, there must be an earlier state where p2 is in l1_4. So if we move p1 to l1_1 after step 10 (when p2 is in l1_4), that's okay. But during steps 11-16, p2 is being moved back, which might complicate things.

Alternatively, maybe we can interleave the steps. Let's try:

After step 10 (p2 is in l1_4), start moving p1.

Steps for p1:

17. Loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (a2 is back in l2_1 after flying to l1_1 and back? Wait, no: after step 5, a2 is in l1_1. To fly back, we need to fly it back to l2_1. But in steps 1-16, after step 5 (fly a2 to l1_1), we need to fly a2 back to l2_1 to use it again. But in the steps I outlined earlier, after step 5, a2 is in l1_1. Then step 6 unloads p2 into l1_1. Then steps 7-10 involve t1 moving p2 to l1_4. Then steps 11-16 involve moving p2 back, which requires a1 to fly from l1_1 to l2_1 (step 15). So a1 is in l1_1 initially. After step 15, a1 is in l2_1. So maybe a2 is still in l1_1 after step 5. So to move p1, which is in l2_1, we need to use a different airplane. Wait, initial state: a1 is in l1_1, a2 is in l2_1. So p1 is in l2_1. To move p1 to l1_1, we can load it into a2 (which is in l2_1), fly a2 to l1_1.

But after step 5, a2 was flown to l1_1 (step 5), but then in step 14, we load p2 into a1 (which is in l1_1). Then fly a1 to l2_1 (step 15). So after step 15, a1 is in l2_1. So after step 16, p2 is in l2_1.

Then, to move p1:

17. Loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (since a2 is in l1_1 after step 5, but to load p1 into a2, a2 must be in l2_1. So perhaps after moving p2 back, we need to fly a2 back to l2_1. But this complicates the steps.

This is getting really complicated. Maybe there's a more optimal way.

Alternative approach: since p2's goal is l2_1, but in the initial state, p2 is in l2_2. So we need to move p2 to l2_1. But the fifth constraint says that if p1 is in l1_1 at any state, then p2 must have been in l1_4 before. So perhaps we can first move p2 to l1_4, then move p1 to l1_1, and then move p2 back to l2_1.

But moving p2 back to l2_1 would require the steps outlined earlier.

Alternatively, maybe we can satisfy the fifth constraint by having p1 in l1_1 temporarily during its journey to l1_2, and ensure that p2 was in l1_4 before that.

Let me try to outline a possible plan:

1. Move p2 to l1_4 (as per steps 1-10).
   - This involves driving t2 to l2_2, loading p2, driving back to l2_1, loading into a2, flying to l1_1, unloading, then using t1 to take to l1_4.

2. Then, move p1 from l2_1 to l1_1 using a2 (assuming a2 is back in l2_1 after step 5. Wait, no: after step 5 (fly a2 to l1_1), a2 is in l1_1. To use it again to carry p1, we need to fly it back to l2_1. But how? Because after step 5, a2 is in l1_1. So steps would be:

After step 5 (fly a2 to l1_1), unload p2 (step 6). Then fly a2 back to l2_1:

6. Flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1 (now a2 is back in l2_1)
7. Loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (p1 is in l2_1)
8. Flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (carrying p1)
9. Unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (now p1 is in l1_1)
10. Drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
11. Loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
12. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
13. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 (achieve p1's goal)

But during this, step 9 puts p1 in l1_1. The fifth constraint requires that before this, p2 was in l1_4. Which was achieved in step 10 (unloading p2 in l1_4). Wait, but the order of steps matters. So if step 9 (p1 in l1_1) comes after step 10 (p2 in l1_4), then the constraint is satisfied.

But let's see the exact order of steps:

Assuming the steps are:

For p2's movement to l1_4:

1. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
2. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
3. Drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
4. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (now p2 is back in l2_1, which is its goal, but this doesn't help for the fifth constraint. So this approach is wrong.

Wait, no. To get p2 to l1_4, we need to load it into an airplane. So steps should be:

1. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
2. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
3. Drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 (now p2 is in t2 at l2_1)
4. Loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
5. Flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
6. Unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (p2 in l1_1)
7. Drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
8. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
9. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
10. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (now p2 is in l1_4, satisfying the fifth constraint's precondition)

Then, fly a2 back to l2_1 to transport p1:

11. Flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1 (now a2 is back in l2_1)
12. Loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (p1 is in l2_1)
13. Flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
14. Unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (p1 is in l1_1, satisfying the fourth constraint)
15. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 (t1 is in l1_4 after step 9)
16. Loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
17. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
18. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 (goal achieved for p1)

Now, after step 14, p1 is in l1_1, which requires that p2 was in l1_4 before. Which was done in step 10. So that's good.

Now, we need to handle p2's movement back to l2_1 to meet its goal. After step 10, p2 is in l1_4. To get it back:

19. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 (assuming t1 is in l1_4 after step 9)
Wait, after step 9, t1 is in l1_4. After step 10, p2 is in l1_4. Then step 15 has t1 driving from l1_4 to l1_1. So:

19. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (after step 10, p2 is in l1_4)
20. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
21. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
22. Loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (a1 is in l1_1)
23. Flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
24. Unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (now p2 is back in l2_1)

But this adds steps 19-24. However, the goal for p2 is to be in l2_1, which is achieved in step 24. But according to the initial plan outline, after step 10, p2 is in l1_4. Then steps 11-18 move p1 to l1_2, but p2 is still in l1_4. So after that, we need steps 19-24 to move p2 back.

But this makes the plan very long. However, considering all constraints, it's necessary.

Now, let's check the first constraint: p1 must be in l2_4 or l1_4. In this plan, p1 is flown to l1_1 (step 14), then driven to l1_2. So p1 is never in l1_4. Therefore, this plan does not satisfy the first constraint. So we need to adjust.

To satisfy the first constraint, p1 must be in l1_4 or l2_4 at some point. Since p1 is being moved through l1_1 to l1_2, perhaps we can detour it to l1_4. For example:

After step 14 (p1 in l1_1):

15. Drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 (assuming t1 is in l1_2 initially. Wait, no: after step 7, t1 was driven to l1_1. Then step 9 drives to l1_4. After step 10, t1 is in l1_4. Then step 15 is driving t1 from l1_4 to l1_1. So t1 is in l1_1 after step 15. Then step 16 loads p1 into t1. Then step 17 drives to l1_2. But to make p1 pass through l1_4, perhaps we can adjust the route:

After step 14 (p1 in l1_1), steps could be:

15. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 (t1 is in l1_4 after step 9)
Wait, no. After step 9, t1 is in l1_4. To load p1 into t1, we need to drive t1 to l1_1. So:

15. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 (now t1 is in l1_1)
16. Loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
17. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1 (now p1 is in t1 at l1_4)
18. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4 (satisfies first constraint)
19. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1
20. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 (achieves goal)

This way, p1 is in l1_4 at step 18, satisfying the first constraint.

But this adds steps. So let's revise the plan:

Steps for p2 to l1_4:

1. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
2. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
3. Drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
4. Loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
5. Flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
6. Unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
7. Drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
8. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
9. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
10. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (p2 in l1_4)

Fly a2 back:

11. Flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1

Move p1:

12. Loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
13. Flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
14. Unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (p1 in l1_1)

Move p1 to l1_2 via l1_4:

15. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 (t1 is in l1_4 after step 9)
16. Loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
17. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
18. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4 (p1 in l1_4, satisfying first constraint)
19. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1
20. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 (goal)

Now, p2 is still in l1_4. We need to move it back to l2_1:

21. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (t1 is in l1_2 after step 19? No, after step 19, t1 is in l1_2. So steps 21 onward would need to use t1 again.

Wait, after step 19, t1 is in l1_2. So to move p2 from l1_4 to l2_1:

21. Drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1
22. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
23. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
24. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
25. Loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (a1 is in l1_1)
26. Flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
27. Unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (now p2 is in l2_1)

This adds more steps, but satisfies all constraints:

- p2 is in l2_2 initially (constraint 2: must be in l2_2 at some state. Initial state satisfies this).

- Constraint 3: If p2 is in l2_2, then p1 is in l2_1 at that state or after. Since p2 is in l2_2 initially and p1 is in l2_1 initially, this is satisfied.

- Constraint 4: p1 must be in l1_1. Step 14.

- Constraint 5: when p1 is in l1_1 (step 14), there must be an earlier state where p2 is in l1_4 (step 10).

- Constraint 1: p1 is in l1_4 (step 18).

But this plan is very long. The problem asks for an optimal plan (shortest possible). So perhaps there's a shorter way.

Alternative approach: instead of moving p2 to l1_4 and back, which adds many steps, maybe we can find a way to satisfy the fifth constraint differently.

The fifth constraint says that if p1 is in l1_1, then there must be an earlier state where p2 is in l1_4. But maybe we can have p1 in l1_1 only once, and ensure that before that, p2 is in l1_4.

But in the initial plan where p1 is flown to l1_1 and then driven to l1_2, p1 is in l1_1. So to satisfy the fifth constraint, p2 must have been in l1_4 before. But moving p2 to l1_4 requires several steps.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the fact that the fifth constraint requires that if p1 is in l1_1 at any state, then p2 must have been in l1_4 before. So if we can avoid having p1 in l1_1, maybe we can bypass that constraint. But the goal is to have p1 in l1_2 (c1), which requires moving from l2_1 (c2). The only way to move between cities is by airplane. So p1 must be flown to l1_1 (c1's airport), then driven to l1_2. So p1 must pass through l1_1, which triggers the fifth constraint. Therefore, we can't avoid it.

So the fifth constraint is unavoidable, hence the need to move p2 to l1_4.

But perhaps there's a shorter path. Let's think:

What if we move p1 to l1_1 first, but then the fifth constraint requires that p2 was in l1_4 before. So p2 must be moved to l1_4 before p1 arrives in l1_1.

But how to do that efficiently.

Alternatively, perhaps use airplane a1 (which is in l1_1) to move p2 from c2 to c1.

Wait, but airplanes can only move between airports. So to get p2 from c2 to c1's airport l1_1, we can:

1. Load p2 into a2 in l2_1 (after moving it there with t2).
2. Fly a2 to l1_1.
3. Unload p2 into l1_1.
4. Load into t1 and drive to l1_4.

So steps:

1. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
2. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
3. Drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
4. Loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
5. Flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
6. Unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
7. Drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
8. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
9. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
10. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (now p2 in l1_4)
11. Flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1 (to get a2 back to move p1)
12. Loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
13. Flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
14. Unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (now p1 in l1_1)
15. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 (t1 is in l1_4 after step 9)
16. Loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
17. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
18. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 (p1's goal)
19. Now, need to move p2 back to l2_1:
    a. Drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1 (t1 is in l1_2 after step 17)
    b. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
    c. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
    d. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
    e. Loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
    f. Flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
    g. Unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (p2's goal)

But this is still many steps. However, the fifth constraint is satisfied because p2 is in l1_4 (step 10) before p1 is in l1_1 (step 14).

The first constraint is satisfied by p1 being in l1_4. Wait, in this plan, p1 is never in l1_4. So to satisfy the first constraint, we need to route p1 through l1_4 or l2_4. 

So perhaps after step 14 (p1 in l1_1), we drive t1 to l1_4, unload, then drive to l1_2.

So steps:

14. Unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (p1 in l1_1)
15. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 (t1 is in l1_4 after step 9)
16. Loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
17. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
18. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4 (p1 in l1_4, satisfying constraint 1)
19. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1
20. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 (goal)

Now, this plan has 20 steps. But we need to check if all constraints are met.

Constraints:

1. p1 in l1_4 (step 18) → satisfied.

2. p2 in l2_2 (initial state) → satisfied.

3. If p2 is in l2_2 in any state, then p1 must be in l2_1 at that state or after. Initial state has p2 in l2_2 and p1 in l2_1 → satisfied.

4. p1 in l1_1 (step 14) → satisfied.

5. If p1 is in l1_1 (step 14), then p2 must have been in l1_4 before (step 10) → satisfied.

Now, the steps for moving p2 back to l2_1 are steps 21-27, but the goal requires p2 to be in l2_1. However, in this plan, after step 10, p2 is in l1_4, and the goal is p2 in l2_1. So steps 21-27 are necessary to move p2 back.

But this makes the plan very long. However, given the constraints, it's necessary.

But perhaps there's a way to avoid moving p2 back. Wait, the goal is to have p2 in l2_1, which is where it started. So if during the plan, p2 is moved to l1_4 and then back to l2_1, that's okay. But the initial state already has p2 in l2_1. Wait, no: initial state says "Package p2 is in location l2_2". So p2 starts in l2_2, and the goal is to have it in l2_1. So during the plan, we need to move p2 from l2_2 to l2_1. However, the steps I outlined earlier move p2 from l2_2 to l1_4 and then to l2_1. But perhaps there's a more efficient way to achieve this.

Wait, perhaps we can move p2 from l2_2 to l2_1 directly with t2, which would achieve its goal and satisfy the second constraint (p2 in l2_2 is already in the initial state, but the second constraint requires that p2 is in l2_2 at least once, which is satisfied initially. However, the third constraint says that if p2 is in l2_2 in any state, then p1 must be in l2_1 at that state or after. Since p2 is in l2_2 in the initial state and p1 is in l2_1 initially, that's satisfied. So moving p2 from l2_2 to l2_1 directly would satisfy its goal, and the second constraint is satisfied by the initial state.

But the fifth constraint requires that if p1 is in l1_1, then p2 was in l1_4 before. So even if we move p2 directly to l2_1, we still need to move p2 to l1_4 before p1 is in l1_1.

So the steps would be:

1. Move p2 to l2_1 (achieving its goal) using t2.
   - Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
   - Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
   - Drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
   - Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (now p2 is in l2_1, goal achieved)

But then, the fifth constraint requires that if p1 is in l1_1 (which it will be when flown there), then p2 must have been in l1_4 before. But in this case, p2 was never in l1_4. So this approach won't work. Hence, we must move p2 to l1_4 before moving p1 to l1_1.

So the plan must include moving p2 to l1_4 and back to l2_1, even though it's more steps.

Given all this, the optimal plan would involve the following steps:

1. Move p2 from l2_2 to l2_1 using t2 (but this doesn't help with the fifth constraint).

But no, we need to move p2 to l1_4 first.

Let me try to outline the shortest possible plan that meets all constraints:

1. Load p2 into t2 and drive to l2_1:
   - Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2 (step 1)
   - Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (step 2)
   - Drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 (step 3)
   - Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (step 4) → p2 now in l2_1 (its goal)
   - But this doesn't help with the fifth constraint, as p2 is never in l1_4.

So this plan is invalid because when p1 is in l1_1, there's no prior state where p2 was in l1_4.

Thus, the only way is to move p2 to l1_4, then back to l2_1, and move p1 through l1_1.

Putting it all together, the optimal plan would be:

```
```
1. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
2. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
3. Drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
4. Loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
5. Flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
6. Unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
7. Drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
8. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
9. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
10. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
11. Flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
12. Loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
13. Flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
14. Unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
15. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
16. Loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
17. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
18. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
19. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1
20. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
21. Drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1
22. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
23. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
24. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
25. Loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
26. Flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
27. Unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
```
```

But this is 27 steps, which seems too long. However, considering all the constraints and the necessary movements, it might be the shortest possible. But perhaps there's a more optimal way.

Wait, maybe after step 10 (p2 in l1_4), we can fly a2 back to l2_1 (step 11), then use a2 to fly p1 to l1_1 (step 12-14). Then, drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1 (step 15), load p1, drive to l1_4 (step 17), unload (step 18), then drive to l1_2 (step 19-20). This covers the first constraint (p1 in l1_4). Then, move p2 back:

But perhaps we can interleave steps to reduce the total.

Alternative plan:

```
```
1. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
2. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
3. Drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
4. Loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
5. Flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
6. Unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
7. Drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
8. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
9. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
10. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
11. Flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
12. Loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
13. Flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
14. Unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
15. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
16. Loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
17. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
18. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
19. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1
20. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
21. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
22. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
23. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
24. Loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
25. Flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
26. Unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
```
```

This reduces some steps, but it's still 26 actions. However, I'm not sure if this is the optimal plan. Maybe there's a way to combine steps or avoid unnecessary movements.

For example, after step 10, p2 is in l1_4. Then, steps 15-20 move p1 to l1_2 via l1_4, which satisfies the first constraint. Then, steps 21-26 move p2 back to l2_1.

But perhaps there's a way to reuse the same truck or airplane more efficiently.

Another observation: after step 10, t1 is in l1_4. To move p1 from l1_1 to l1_2 via l1_4, steps 15-20 are needed. But maybe we can load p1 into t1 in l1_1, drive to l1_4, unload (satisfying the first constraint), then drive to l1_2.

But that's what steps 15-20 do.

In any case, this seems to be the minimal plan considering all constraints. The answer must include all necessary steps to satisfy each constraint and achieve the goal.
