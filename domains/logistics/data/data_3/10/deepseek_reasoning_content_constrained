Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. So, the goal is to get p1 to l2_5 and p2 to l2_2. But there are several constraints we need to satisfy as well. Let me start by understanding the initial state and the constraints.

First, the initial state:

- Cities c1 and c2 each have several locations. The airports are l1_1 in c1 and l2_1 in c2.
- Packages:
  - p1 is at l2_3 in c2.
  - p2 is at l1_4 in c1.
  - Trucks t1 is at l1_4 (c1) and t2 at l2_5 (c2).
  - Airplanes a1 is at l1_1 (c1's airport), a2 at l2_1 (c2's airport).

The goal is p1 in l2_5 and p2 in l2_2.

Constraints:

1. p2 must be in l2_2 in at least one state. That's part of the goal, so that's covered.
2. If p2 is in l2_2 in some state, there must be an earlier state where p1 or p2 was in l1_3.
3. p2 must be in l2_1 at some point.
4. If p2 is in l2_1 in state s, then in s or a later state, p2 must be in l1_2 or p1 in l2_2.
5. At least once, p1 must be in l1_2 or l2_4.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down.

First, moving p1 from l2_3 (c2) to l2_5 (c2). Since both are in c2, maybe a truck can handle it. But t2 is at l2_5, so we need to move t2 to l2_3 to pick up p1. Wait, wait. Wait, the initial state says "Package t1 is in location l1_4" and "Package t2 is in location l2_5". Wait, but the objects are "truck t1" and "truck t2". So that's a typo in the problem statement? Because "Package t1" doesn't make sense. Probably, it's a mistake, and it's "Truck t1 is in location l1_4" and "Truck t2 is in location l2_5". Otherwise, loading them into trucks wouldn't make sense. So I'll assume that's a typo. So trucks are at l1_4 (t1 in c1) and l2_5 (t2 in c2).

So for p1 in l2_3 (c2), which is in c2. To get to l2_5. Since t2 is at l2_5, but p1 is at l2_3. So maybe drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_3, load p1, then drive to l2_5 and unload. But wait, l2_5 is where t2 starts. Wait, the problem is to get p1 to l2_5. So maybe:

- Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_3 (since cities allow trucks to move between their locations).
- Load p1 into t2 at l2_3.
- Drive t2 back to l2_5.
- Unload p1 there.

That would work for p1's part. But let's check the constraints. Let's see if that affects any constraints.

Now for p2: it's at l1_4 in c1. Need to get it to l2_2 in c2. Since cities are connected by airplanes. So probably, we need to move p2 from l1_4 to an airport in c1 (l1_1), then fly it to c2's airport (l2_1), then transport it to l2_2.

But how?

So steps for p2:

1. In c1, move p2 from l1_4 to l1_1 (airport). Since t1 is at l1_4. So drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_4 (no, wait, t1 is already there). Wait, t1 is in l1_4. So load p2 into t1 at l1_4. Then drive t1 to another location. Wait, but to get to the airport l1_1, which is in c1. So drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1. But wait, cities have locations connected. The drivetruck action allows moving between any locations in the same city. So drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1. Then unload p2 at l1_1. Then load it onto airplane a1 (which is at l1_1). Fly a1 to l2_1 (c2's airport). Then unload p2 from a1 at l2_1. Then in c2, use a truck to move p2 to l2_2. But the trucks in c2 are t2, which is currently at l2_5. Wait, but after moving t2 to l2_3 and back for p1, maybe we can use it for p2 as well. Wait, but the constraints might complicate this.

Wait, the constraints:

Constraint 2: When p2 is in l2_2 (the goal), there must have been an earlier state where p1 or p2 was in l1_3. So during the plan, we need to have either p1 or p2 in l1_3 at some point before p2 reaches l2_2.

Constraint 3: p2 must be in l2_1 at some state. That will happen when we unload it from the airplane in l2_1.

Constraint 4: When p2 is in l2_1 (state s), then in s or later, either p2 is in l1_2 or p1 in l2_2. Since l1_2 is in c1, and p2 is moving to c2, getting p2 to l1_2 after being in l2_1 would require moving back, which complicates. Alternatively, p1 in l2_2. But p1's goal is l2_5, so maybe we can have p1 pass through l2_2. Let's see. If when we move p1 from l2_3 to l2_5, maybe we take a detour through l2_2. So instead of t2 going l2_5 -> l2_3 -> l2_5, maybe go l2_5 -> l2_2 -> l2_3 -> l2_5. But that adds steps. But perhaps necessary to satisfy constraint 4.

Wait, constraint 4 says that if p2 is in l2_1 (which it will be when we unload it from the airplane), then in that state or later, either p2 is in l1_2 or p1 is in l2_2. So after p2 is in l2_1, we need to have p1 in l2_2 at some point. So maybe when moving p1, after unloading it in l2_5, but that's the goal. Alternatively, perhaps during the movement of p1, we have it in l2_2. So maybe the path for p1 is l2_3 -> l2_2 (via truck) -> l2_5. Then when p1 is in l2_2, that would satisfy the condition for constraint 4. Let's check:

If we have p2 in l2_1 (after unloading from airplane), then later, when p1 is in l2_2 (during transport), that would satisfy constraint 4.

So let's adjust the plan for p1:

Instead of driving t2 directly from l2_5 to l2_3, load p1, then drive back to l2_5, perhaps we take a detour through l2_2.

So steps for p1:

- Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2 (possible since both in c2).
- Then drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_3.
- Load p1 into t2 at l2_3.
- Drive t2 back to l2_2, unload p1 there (this would make p1 in l2_2, satisfying constraint 4 and constraint 5 (since p1 is in l2_2, which is part of constraint 5's "at least one of l1_2 or l2_4"). Then, reload p1 into t2 (if needed) and drive to l2_5.

Wait, but that adds more steps. Alternatively, after loading p1 at l2_3, drive to l2_2, unload, then drive to l2_5. But the goal is to have p1 in l2_5, so that's okay. But this would require:

1. Drive t2 l2_5 -> l2_2 (precondition: t2 is in l2_5, which it is initially. So yes.)

2. Then drive t2 l2_2 -> l2_3. Load p1.

3. Drive t2 l2_3 -> l2_2. Unload p1. Now p1 is in l2_2. Then load again, drive to l2_5. But that's two extra steps. However, this would satisfy constraint 4 and 5.

But maybe there's a more efficient way. Let's see.

Alternatively, after unloading p2 in l2_1, perhaps we can have p1 in l2_2 at some point after that. Let's see.

Now, let's think about the constraints again.

Constraint 5: At least once, p1 must be in l1_2 or l2_4. Since p1 starts in l2_3, moving to l2_2 (as part of the plan) would not satisfy constraint 5. Wait, constraint 5 is "p1 is in l1_2 or l2_4". So if the plan doesn't move p1 to either of these locations, then it's invalid. So the previous idea of moving p1 to l2_2 would not satisfy constraint 5, because l2_2 isn't one of the options. Wait, no: the constraint is "at least one of the following conditions is true: p1 is in l1_2 or p1 is in l2_4". So if during the plan, p1 is in l2_4, that's okay. Alternatively, if it's in l1_2. But p1 starts in c2. So how could it get to l1_2 (which is in c1)? That would require flying, which isn't part of the current plan. So maybe we need to have p1 transported to l2_4 at some point.

Wait, but p1's goal is l2_5. So if during transportation, p1 passes through l2_4, then that would satisfy constraint 5. For example, if t2 drives from l2_3 to l2_4, then to l2_5. So:

Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_3 (through l2_4?), but cities have multiple locations. The drive action can go directly between any two locations in the same city. So maybe drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_4, then to l2_3. Then load p1 at l2_3, drive back through l2_4 to l2_5. So during that, p1 would be in l2_4 (when the truck passes through). But wait, when you load a package into a truck and drive, the package is inside the truck. So if the truck is in l2_4, the package is inside the truck, not in the location. So unless you unload it there, the package isn't in the location. So to satisfy constraint 5, p1 needs to be unloaded in l2_4 or l1_2. But l1_2 is in c1, which is a different city. So perhaps we need to have p1 unloaded at l2_4. But that's not on the way to l2_5 unless we make it part of the plan.

So, for p1's plan:

Option 1:

- Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_3 (direct).
- Load p1 into t2 at l2_3.
- Drive t2 to l2_4.
- Unload p1 in l2_4 (satisfies constraint 5).
- Load p1 again into t2.
- Drive to l2_5 and unload.

But this adds steps but satisfies constraint 5. However, this would make p1 pass through l2_4, so in that state, p1 is in l2_4, satisfying constraint 5.

Alternatively, could we have p1 in l2_4 as part of the transport without unloading? No, because the package is in the truck, not the location. So unloading is necessary.

But that adds two steps (unload and load again). Is there a better way?

Alternatively, maybe using the airplane to transport p1. But p1 is in c2, and needs to stay in c2. Unless we move it to c1 and back, but that's not efficient.

Alternatively, maybe using the truck to go from l2_3 to l2_4 to l2_5. But again, unless we unload, p1 isn't in l2_4.

So perhaps the steps are:

1. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_3.

2. Load p1 into t2 at l2_3.

3. Drive t2 to l2_4. (Now p1 is in t2 at l2_4.)

4. Unload p1 at l2_4. (Now p1 is in l2_4, satisfying constraint 5.)

5. Load p1 into t2 again.

6. Drive to l2_5 and unload.

That's more steps, but necessary for constraint 5.

Now, considering all constraints, let's outline the plan step by step.

First, handle p2:

p2 is in l1_4 (c1). Need to get to l2_2 (c2). So steps:

1. Use truck t1 (in l1_4) to load p2.

Action: loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4.

2. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1 (airport in c1).

Action: drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1.

3. Unload p2 at l1_1.

Action: unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

4. Load p2 into airplane a1 (which is at l1_1).

Action: loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1.

5. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1 (c2's airport).

Action: flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1.

6. Unload p2 from a1 at l2_1.

Action: unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1.

Now, p2 is at l2_1. This satisfies constraint 3 (p2 in l2_1 at some state).

Now, according to constraint 4: when p2 is in l2_1 (state after step 6), then in that state or later, p2 must be in l1_2 or p1 in l2_2. Since p2 is going to l2_2 eventually, maybe we can satisfy this by ensuring that p1 is in l2_2 after this point. Alternatively, since p2 will be moved to l2_2, but that's the goal. But the constraint requires that after p2 is in l2_1, either p2 is in l1_2 (which is in c1) or p1 is in l2_2 (c2). Since p2 is in c2 now, moving it to l1_2 would require sending it back, which is not needed. So the better option is to have p1 in l2_2 after this.

So, during p1's transportation, we need to have p1 in l2_2. So let's adjust p1's plan to include that.

p1 starts at l2_3 (c2). Needs to go to l2_5. But also needs to be in l2_2 or l2_4 to satisfy constraint 5. Let's combine both.

Option for p1:

- Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2 (satisfies being in l2_2 later if we unload there? But no, the truck is moving.)

Wait, to have p1 in l2_2, we need to unload it there. But the goal is to have p1 in l2_5. So maybe:

1. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_3.

2. Load p1 into t2 at l2_3.

3. Drive t2 to l2_2 and unload p1 (now p1 is in l2_2, satisfying constraint 4's condition when p2 was in l2_1. Also, this would be after p2 is in l2_1, which is after step 6.)

4. Then load p1 again into t2.

5. Drive to l2_5 and unload.

But this way, p1 is in l2_2, which satisfies the condition for constraint 4. Also, during this process, p1 is in l2_2, which is part of constraint 5's options? No, constraint 5 requires p1 to be in l1_2 or l2_4. So this doesn't help. Oh, right! Constraint 5 is about p1 being in l1_2 or l2_4. So having p1 in l2_2 doesn't satisfy constraint 5. So that's a problem. Therefore, we need to ensure that p1 is either in l1_2 or l2_4 at some point.

But p1 starts in c2 and needs to end in c2. Moving it to l1_2 (c1) would require flying, which is possible but adds steps. Alternatively, moving it to l2_4.

So let's adjust the p1 plan to include a stop at l2_4.

So p1's plan:

1. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_4.

2. Then drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_3.

3. Load p1 into t2 at l2_3.

4. Drive t2 back to l2_4.

5. Unload p1 at l2_4 (satisfies constraint 5).

6. Load p1 again into t2.

7. Drive to l2_5 and unload.

But this adds several steps. Alternatively, during the movement from l2_3 to l2_5, take a detour through l2_4 and unload there.

But again, the steps would be:

For p1:

- Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_3.

- Load p1 into t2.

- Drive to l2_4, unload (satisfies constraint 5).

- Load again, drive to l2_5, unload.

So steps:

Action: drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_3 c2

Action: loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

Action: drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2

Action: unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

Action: loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

Action: drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2

Action: unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

This would get p1 to l2_5 and have it in l2_4, satisfying constraint 5.

Now, considering constraint 2: when p2 is in l2_2 (the goal), there must be an earlier state where p1 or p2 was in l1_3.

So we need to have either p1 or p2 in l1_3 before p2 reaches l2_2.

Looking at the current plan for p2: after being unloaded at l2_1, we need to move it to l2_2. How?

After step 6 (p2 is at l2_1 in c2), we need to move it to l2_2. So we can use truck t2, but t2 is being used for p1. So perhaps use another truck. Wait, the trucks are t1 (in c1) and t2 (in c2). So in c2, only t2 is available. So after p1's plan uses t2, but the timing needs to be considered. We need to move p2 from l2_1 to l2_2. So steps for p2 after step 6:

7. Load p2 into t2 at l2_1. Wait, but t2 is in l2_5 after moving p1. Wait, no, this is getting complicated. Let's think again.

Wait, after step 6, p2 is at l2_1 (c2's airport). To get to l2_2, we need a truck in c2. t2 is initially at l2_5. But during p1's transportation, t2 is moving around. So the timing is important. We need to ensure that after p2 is in l2_1, we can load it into a truck (t2) and drive to l2_2.

But t2's plan for p1 may conflict. So perhaps we need to interleave the steps.

Let's outline the entire plan step by step, considering all actions.

First, handle p2's movement from l1_4 to l2_1:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1

3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

4. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

6. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (now p2 is at l2_1, satisfying constraint 3)

Now, need to move p2 from l2_1 to l2_2. But how? Use truck t2 in c2. But t2 is initially at l2_5. So we need to get t2 to l2_1. But t2 is needed for moving p1. Let's see.

But p1's plan requires t2 to move from l2_5 to l2_3, load p1, then go to l2_4, unload, then to l2_5. But if we need to use t2 to move p2 from l2_1 to l2_2, perhaps we can interleave these actions.

So after step 6 (p2 at l2_1), we need to have t2 available to move p2. But t2 is currently at l2_5. Let's first move t2 from l2_5 to l2_1, but that's in c2. However, the truck can only move within its city. So l2_1 is in c2. So yes, t2 can drive from l2_5 to l2_1. But wait, the locations in c2 are l2_1 (airport), l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5. So yes, t2 can drive between these.

So steps:

7. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2

8. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

9. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2

10. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (now p2 is in l2_2, goal achieved)

But between steps 6 and 7, p2 is at l2_1, and t2 is at l2_5. So after step 6, we can drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (step 7), load p2 (step 8), drive to l2_2 (step9), unload (step10). This would get p2 to its goal.

However, during this time, we also need to handle p1's transportation. So let's see.

But p1's plan requires t2 to be used for moving p1. So if we first handle p2's movement to l2_2, then use t2 for p1, but perhaps the order matters.

Wait, the steps for p1 (as per earlier plan) would require t2 to be in l2_5 initially. But after moving t2 to l2_1 for p2, it's in l2_1. So perhaps we need to reorder.

Alternatively, maybe we can first move p2 using t2, then use t2 for p1. But that might not be possible if the timing affects the constraints.

Alternatively, let's interleave the steps.

Here's a possible plan outline:

For p2:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1

3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

4. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

6. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

For moving p2 from l2_1 to l2_2:

7. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 (move t2 to l2_1)

8. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

9. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2

10. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

For p1:

11. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2 (drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_3)

12. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

13. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2

14. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (satisfies constraint 5)

15. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

16. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2

17. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

But wait, after step 10, t2 is at l2_2. Then step 11 moves it to l2_3. Then steps proceed.

But this requires t2 to be available for both p2 and p1. But the order would work.

Now, let's check the constraints.

Constraint 2: When p2 is in l2_2 (step10), there must be an earlier state where p1 or p2 was in l1_3.

In the current plan, p2 is at l1_3 at any point? No. p2 starts at l1_4, moves to l1_1, then l2_1, then l2_2. So never in l1_3. p1 starts at l2_3, moves to l2_3 (loaded), then to l2_4, etc. So p1 is in l2_3 (initial location), but in step12, it's loaded into t2 at l2_3. So the package is in l2_3 initially. So in the initial state, p1 is in l2_3. So the condition "Package p1 is in l2_3" holds in the initial state. Therefore, before p2 is in l2_2 (step10), there's an earlier state (the initial state) where p1 is in l2_3. So constraint 2 is satisfied because "At least one of p1 in l1_3 or p2 in l1_3" is true in the initial state (p1 in l2_3 isn't part of it, but wait, the constraint says "Package p1 is in location l1_3" or "Package p2 is in location l1_3". So l1_3 is in c1. So p1 is in l2_3 (c2), which is not l1_3. So the initial state does not satisfy the condition for constraint 2. Therefore, we need to have either p1 or p2 in l1_3 before p2 reaches l2_2.

So this plan doesn't satisfy constraint 2. So we need to adjust the plan.

This is a problem. How can we get p1 or p2 to l1_3 before p2 reaches l2_2?

Possible options:

- Move p2 to l1_3 during its journey. But p2 starts in c1, then moves to c2. To get to l1_3, which is in c1, but after being flown to c2, it's in l2_1. So that's not feasible unless we bring it back, which complicates things.

Alternatively, move p1 to l1_3. But p1 starts in c2. So to get to l1_3 (c1), we need to fly p1 to c1. But that's a lot of steps.

Alternative approach: Adjust the plan to have p2 pass through l1_3 before being loaded onto the airplane.

Wait, p2 is initially in l1_4 (c1). To get to the airport l1_1, maybe the truck t1 can take a detour through l1_3. So instead of driving directly from l1_4 to l1_1, drive via l1_3.

So steps for p2:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1 (now p2 is in l1_3 via truck)

3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (now p2 is in l1_3, satisfying constraint 2's required earlier state)

4. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

5. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1

6. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

Then proceed as before.

This way, p2 is in l1_3 at step3, which is before p2 reaches l2_2 (step10). So constraint 2 is satisfied because there's an earlier state where p2 is in l1_3.

This adds steps but is necessary.

Now, let's revise the plan with this in mind.

Revised steps for p2:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1

3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (now p2 is in l1_3)

4. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

5. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1

6. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

7. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

8. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

9. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

Now, to move p2 from l2_1 to l2_2:

10. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2

11. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

12. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2

13. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

Now, for p1:

14. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2

15. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

16. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2

17. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (satisfies constraint 5)

18. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

19. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2

20. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

Now, checking constraints:

- Constraint 2: When p2 is in l2_2 (step13), there's an earlier state (step3) where p2 was in l1_3. So satisfied.

- Constraint 3: p2 is in l2_1 (step9). Satisfied.

- Constraint 4: After p2 is in l2_1 (step9), in some subsequent state, either p2 in l1_2 or p1 in l2_2. In this plan, p1 is in l2_4 (step17), which doesn't help. But after step13, p2 is in l2_2. But we need to check if after step9, in any subsequent state, p1 is in l2_2 or p2 in l1_2. 

Wait, after step9 (p2 in l2_1), the next steps are moving t2 to l2_1, loading p2, driving to l2_2, and unloading (steps10-13). Then moving t2 to l2_3 (step14), load p1 (step15), drive to l2_4 (step16), unload (step17). So after step9, the first time p1 is moved is step15, loaded into t2 at l2_3. Then driven to l2_4. So p1 is in l2_4 at step17, which satisfies constraint5, but doesn't help with constraint4.

Constraint4 requires that after p2 is in l2_1 (step9), in that state or later, either p2 is in l1_2 or p1 is in l2_2. But in this plan, after step9, p2 is moved to l2_2 (step13), so p2 is in l2_2. But l2_2 is not l1_2 (which is in c1). So the condition isn't met. Thus, this plan doesn't satisfy constraint4.

So this is a problem. How to resolve this?

Constraint4 states: If p2 is in l2_1 (which happens at step9), then in that state or later, either p2 is in l1_2 or p1 is in l2_2.

In the current plan, after step9 (p2 in l2_1), the next steps for p2 are to move to l2_2 (step13). So p2 is never in l1_2 (c1), and p1 is moved to l2_4 (step17), not l2_2. So constraint4 is violated.

So we need to adjust the plan to ensure that after p2 is in l2_1 (step9), either p2 is moved to l1_2 or p1 is moved to l2_2.

Moving p2 to l1_2 would require transporting it back to c1, which is time-consuming. Alternatively, have p1 in l2_2 after step9.

So perhaps during p1's transportation, we route through l2_2.

But p1's current plan has p1 going from l2_3 to l2_4 to l2_5. To get p1 to l2_2, we could modify the steps:

After step15 (p1 loaded into t2 at l2_3), drive to l2_2 instead of l2_4.

So revised steps for p1:

14. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2 (from step13, t2 is in l2_2 after step13)

Wait, no. After step13, t2 is in l2_2 (after unloading p2). So step14 would be drivetruck t2 from l2_2 to l2_3.

15. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

16. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2 (now p1 is in t2 at l2_2)

17. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (now p1 is in l2_2, satisfying constraint4)

18. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

19. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2

20. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (satisfies constraint5)

21. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

22. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2

23. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

But this adds steps. Now, after step17, p1 is in l2_2, which satisfies constraint4. Also, after step20, p1 is in l2_4, satisfying constraint5.

So the revised plan would look like:

For p2:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1

3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

4. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

5. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1

6. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

7. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

8. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

9. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

10. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2

11. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

12. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2

13. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (p2 at goal)

For p1:

14. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2

15. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

16. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2

17. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (now p1 in l2_2, satisfying constraint4)

18. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

19. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2

20. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (satisfies constraint5)

21. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

22. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2

23. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (p1 at goal)

Now, checking constraints:

- Constraint2: Before p2 is in l2_2 (step13), p2 was in l1_3 (step3). Satisfied.

- Constraint3: p2 in l2_1 (step9). Satisfied.

- Constraint4: After p2 is in l2_1 (step9), p1 is in l2_2 at step17. Which is after step9. So satisfied.

- Constraint5: p1 is in l2_4 (step20). Satisfied.

So all constraints are satisfied.

Now, let's verify the plan step by step to ensure preconditions and effects are met.

For p2's part:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4: Precondition: p2 and t1 are in l1_4. Yes, initial state.

2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1: t1 is in l1_4, both locations in c1. Yes.

3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3: t1 is in l1_3, p2 is in t1. Yes.

4. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3: p2 and t1 in l1_3.

5. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1: valid.

6. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1: t1 in l1_1, p2 in t1.

7. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1: a1 is at l1_1, p2 there.

8. fly a1 to l2_1.

9. unload p2 from a1 at l2_1.

10. drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (valid, same city).

11. load p2 into t2 at l2_1.

12. drive to l2_2.

13. unload p2 at l2_2.

For p1's part:

14. drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_3.

15. load p1.

16. drive to l2_2.

17. unload p1 there.

18. load again.

19. drive to l2_4.

20. unload (satisfies constraint5).

21. load again.

22. drive to l2_5.

23. unload.

This plan has 23 actions, but maybe it's optimal. Let's see if there's a shorter way.

Wait, after step13 (p2 in l2_2), t2 is in l2_2. Then steps14-23 involve moving t2 to l2_3, load p1, drive back to l2_2, etc. But maybe we can combine some steps.

Alternative approach: After step13 (t2 in l2_2), drive directly to l2_3 to load p1, then drive to l2_2 to unload p1 (step17), but then drive to l2_4, etc. But that's what the current plan does.

Is there a way to shorten this? For example, after step13, t2 is in l2_2 with p2 unloaded. Then drive to l2_3, load p1, drive to l2_4, unload (constraint5), then to l2_5. But then p1 is in l2_4, which satisfies constraint5, but doesn't satisfy constraint4 (p1 needs to be in l2_2 after p2 is in l2_1). So that's a problem.

Alternatively, after step9 (p2 in l2_1), perhaps before moving p2 to l2_2, we can handle p1 first.

But then p2 would be in l2_1 until later steps, which might not interfere. Let me think.

Alternatively:

After step9 (p2 in l2_1), use t2 to move p1 first, then move p2.

But t2 is in l2_5 initially. So:

10. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_3 c2

11. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

12. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2

13. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (satisfies constraint4)

14. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

15. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2

16. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (constraint5)

17. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

18. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2

19. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

Then move p2 from l2_1 to l2_2:

20. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 (but t2 is in l2_5 after step19)

21. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

22. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2

23. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

But this way, after step19, t2 is at l2_5. Then drive to l2_1 (step20), which is possible. Then load and move p2.

This way, p1's steps are done first, and then p2's. But this might be longer. However, let's check the constraints.

Constraint2: p2 is in l2_2 at step23. Earlier state where p2 was in l1_3 (step3). Satisfied.

Constraint3: p2 in l2_1 (step9). Satisfied.

Constraint4: after step9 (p2 in l2_1), in step13, p1 is in l2_2 (which is after step9). So satisfied.

Constraint5: p1 in l2_4 (step16). Satisfied.

But this plan has 23 steps as well. So maybe it's the same length. However, perhaps there's a way to optimize further.

Wait, perhaps combining the movement of t2 for both packages.

After step9 (p2 in l2_1):

10. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 (t2 moves to l2_1)

11. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

12. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2 (p2 to l2_2)

13. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (p2 done)

14. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2

15. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

16. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2

17. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (constraint5)

18. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

19. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2

20. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

This is 20 steps. But what about constraint4?

After step9 (p2 in l2_1), we move t2 to l2_1 (step10), load p2 (11), drive to l2_2 (12), unload (13). So p2 is in l2_2 at step13.

Then, steps14-20 handle p1. After step13, the next steps are for p1. So in this plan, after p2 is in l2_1 (step9), the next steps are moving p2 to l2_2. So during this, after step13 (p2 in l2_2), the next steps for p1 start. But constraint4 requires that after p2 is in l2_1 (step9), in that state or later, p1 is in l2_2 or p2 in l1_2. 

In this plan, after step9, p2 is moved to l2_2 (step13). So p2 is in l2_2, but not in l1_2. p1 is not in l2_2 until step17 (unload in l2_4 is step17, which is not l2_2). So this plan doesn't satisfy constraint4. Hence, invalid.

Thus, the previous plan where p1 is moved to l2_2 after p2 is in l2_1 is necessary.

Therefore, the initial plan with 23 steps is valid but perhaps not optimal. Let's see if there's a shorter way.

Alternative Idea: When moving p1 from l2_3 to l2_5, can we pass through l2_2 and l2_4 in fewer steps?

For example:

- Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_3.

- Load p1.

- Drive to l2_2, unload (satisfies constraint4), then drive to l2_4, unload (satisfies constraint5), then to l2_5.

But this would be:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_3 c2

2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

3. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2

4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

5. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

6. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2

7. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

8. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

9. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2

10. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

This is 10 steps for p1. Combined with p2's steps (13 steps), total would be 23 steps. Same as before.

So no improvement.

Is there any way to optimize further? Let's think about the order of actions.

For example, after p2 is in l2_1 (step9), and we drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (step10), load p2 (step11), drive to l2_2 (step12), unload (step13). Then t2 is at l2_2. Then drive to l2_3 to load p1 (step14), drive to l2_2 to unload (step15), then drive to l2_4, etc. But this doesn't reduce steps.

Alternatively, after step13 (t2 in l2_2), drive directly to l2_4 with p1.

Wait, no. p1 is in l2_3. So steps for p1:

14. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2

15. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

16. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2

17. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (constraint5)

18. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

19. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2

20. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

But this doesn't address constraint4. Because after step9 (p2 in l2_1), p1 needs to be in l2_2 or p2 in l1_2. In this scenario, p1 is only in l2_4, so constraint4 is not satisfied.

Thus, the initial plan with steps to have p1 in l2_2 after p2 is in l2_1 is necessary.

After extensive analysis, the plan with 23 steps meets all constraints and is optimal in terms of required steps. However, maybe there's a shorter plan.

Another Idea: Use airplanes to move p1 or p2, but since p1 needs to stay in c2, and p2 needs to go from c1 to c2, perhaps we can find a way to combine movements.

Wait, p2's journey is from c1 to c2 via airplane. For p1, it's within c2. So airplanes aren't needed for p1.

But constraint5 requires p1 to be in l2_4. So driving through there is necessary.

Alternative Idea: When moving p2 from l2_1 to l2_2, use a different truck. But there's only t2 in c2.

So no, must use t2.

Thus, the plan seems to be as follows, with 23 steps, satisfying all constraints.
