Let me interpret the problem. We have:
- Two cities, c1 and c2, each with multiple locations.
- Two airports, l1_1 (in c1) and l2_1 (in c2).
- Two trucks, t1 and t2.
- Two airplanes, a1 and a2.
- Two packages, p1 and p2.

The initial state is:
- Locations l1_1, l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5 are in city c1.
- Locations l2_1, l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5 are in city c2.
- t1 is in location l1_4 (I think this is a typo, t1 should be a truck, not a package).
- t2 is in location l2_5 (Again, I think this is a typo, t2 should be a truck).
- p1 is in location l2_3.
- p2 is in location l1_4.
- a1 is in location l1_1 (Again, a1 should be an airplane, not a package).
- a2 is in location l2_1 (Again, a2 should be an airplane).

Given these typos, I'm going to assume the correct initial state is:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_4.
- Truck t2 is in location l2_5.
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1.
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1.
- Package p1 is in location l2_3.
- Package p2 is in location l1_4.

Goal:
- Package p1 should be in location l2_5.
- Package p2 should be in location l2_2.

Constraints:
1. At some point, package p2 should be in location l2_2. (This is already part of the goal, so no additional constraint).
2. Before p2 is in l2_2, either p1 or p2 must be in l1_3.
3. At some point, package p2 should be in location l2_1.
4. Once p2 is in l2_1, either p2 is in l1_2 or p1 is in l2_2 at that state or at some later state.
5. At some point, either p1 is in l1_2 or p1 is in l2_4.

Now, let's think about a plan. We need to transport p1 from l2_3 to l2_5 and p2 from l1_4 to l2_2, while satisfying all the constraints.

Constraint 2 requires either p1 or p2 to be in l1_3 before p2 is in l2_2. Since initially p1 is in l2_3 and p2 is in l1_4, it seems easier to move p2 from l1_4 to l1_3 (they're in the same city).

Constraint 3 requires p2 to be in l2_1 at some point.

Constraint 4 says once p2 is in l2_1, either p2 should be in l1_2 (going back to city c1) or p1 should be in l2_2 (moving p1 from l2_3 to l2_2) at that state or later.

Constraint 5 requires p1 to be either in l1_2 or l2_4 at some point.

Let's think about a potential sequence:

1. Move p2 from l1_4 to l1_3 (satisfying constraint 2).
2. Move p2 to l2_1 (satisfying constraint 3).
3. Move p1 from l2_3 to l2_4 (satisfying constraint 5).
4. Move p1 to l2_2 (satisfying constraint 4 since "p1 is in l2_2" after "p2 is in l2_1").
5. Finally, move p1 to l2_5 and p2 to l2_2 (satisfying the goal).

But the actual sequence will depend on the positions of the trucks and airplanes. Let's trace through a plan step by step, considering these positions.

Initial state:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_4.
- Truck t2 is in location l2_5.
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1.
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1.
- Package p1 is in location l2_3.
- Package p2 is in location l1_4.

Steps for p2:
1. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_4.
2. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_3 (satisfying constraint 2).
3. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_3.
4. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1 (airport in c1).
5. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_3.
6. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1 (airport in c1).
7. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1.
8. Load p2 onto a1 at l1_1.
9. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1 (airport in c2).
10. Unload p2 from a1 at l2_1 (satisfying constraint 3).
11. Load p2 onto a2 at l2_1.
12. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1 (to drop p2 at l1_2 to satisfy constraint 4).
13. Fly a2 from l1_1 to l2_1.
14. Unload p2 from a2 at l2_1.
15. Load p2 onto t2.
16. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2.
17. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_2 (satisfying the goal for p2).

Steps for p1:
1. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_3.
2. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_3.
3. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_4 (satisfying constraint 5).
4. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_2.
5. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_2 (satisfying constraint 4, as "p1 is in l2_2" after "p2 is in l2_1").
6. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_2.
7. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_5.
8. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_5 (satisfying the goal for p1).

But wait, I've made a mistake in the above plan. I cannot reuse t2 for both packages because I've already used it to deliver p2. Let me reconsider the plan.

Actually, I notice there's an issue with my understanding. I was thinking of constraint 4 as: "At some state s where 'p2 is in l2_1', either 'p2 is in l1_2' or 'p1 is in l2_2' at s or at some state after s." But rereading the constraint, it seems to be saying: "If 'p2 is in l2_1' holds at some state s, then either 'p2 is in l1_2' or 'p1 is in l2_2' at s or at some state after s."

So it's a conditional: if p2 is ever in l2_1, then either p2 should be in l1_2 or p1 should be in l2_2 at some point afterward.

Given this, both trucks can be used independently.

Let's try a revised plan:

Initial state:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_4.
- Truck t2 is in location l2_5.
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1.
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1.
- Package p1 is in location l2_3.
- Package p2 is in location l1_4.

Steps for p2:
1. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_4.
2. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_3 (satisfying constraint 2).
3. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_3.
4. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_3.
5. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1 (airport in c1).
6. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1.
7. Load p2 onto a1 at l1_1.
8. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1 (airport in c2).
9. Unload p2 from a1 at l2_1 (satisfying constraint 3).

Now, we need to either move p2 to l1_2 or p1 to l2_2 to satisfy constraint 4.

Let's continue for p1:
1. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_3.
2. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_3.
3. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_4 (satisfying constraint 5).
4. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_2.
5. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_2 (satisfying constraint 4).
6. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_2.
7. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_5.
8. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_5 (satisfying the goal for p1).

And continuing for p2:
10. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_1.
11. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2.
12. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_2 (satisfying the goal for p2).

But this won't work either because t2 is used for both p1 and p2 simultaneously.

Let's take a step back and consider a plan where we handle p1 first.

Initial state:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_4.
- Truck t2 is in location l2_5.
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1.
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1.
- Package p1 is in location l2_3.
- Package p2 is in location l1_4.

Steps for p1:
1. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_3.
2. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_3.
3. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_4 (satisfying constraint 5).
4. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_2.
5. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_2 (this will help satisfy constraint 4).
6. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_2.
7. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_5.
8. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_5 (satisfying the goal for p1).

Steps for p2:
9. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_4.
10. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_3 (satisfying constraint 2).
11. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_3.
12. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_3.
13. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1 (airport in c1).
14. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1.
15. Load p2 onto a1 at l1_1.
16. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1 (airport in c2).
17. Unload p2 from a1 at l2_1 (satisfying constraint 3).
18. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_1.
19. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2.
20. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_2 (satisfying the goal for p2).

Alright, now let's trace through this step by step to ensure it's a valid plan.

Initial state:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_4.
- Truck t2 is in location l2_5.
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1.
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1.
- Package p1 is in location l2_3.
- Package p2 is in location l1_4.

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_3 c2
   After: t2 in l2_3
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
   After: p1 in t2, not in l2_3
3. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
   After: t2 in l2_4, p1 in t2 (satisfying constraint 5: "p1 is in location l2_4")
4. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2
   After: t2 in l2_2, p1 in t2
5. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
   After: p1 in l2_2, not in t2 (this will help satisfy constraint 4)
6. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
   After: p1 in t2, not in l2_2
7. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
   After: t2 in l2_5, p1 in t2
8. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
   After: p1 in l2_5, not in t2 (satisfying the goal for p1)

9. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
   After: p2 in t1, not in l1_4
10. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1
    After: t1 in l1_3, p2 in t1
11. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
    After: p2 in l1_3, not in t1 (satisfying constraint 2: "p2 is in location l1_3")
12. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
    After: p2 in t1, not in l1_3
13. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
    After: t1 in l1_1, p2 in t1
14. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
    After: p2 in l1_1, not in t1
15. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
    After: p2 in a1, not in l1_1
16. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
    After: a1 in l2_1, p2 in a1
17. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
    After: p2 in l2_1, not in a1 (satisfying constraint 3: "p2 is in location l2_1")

But I've noticed a problem: We want to use t2 to deliver p2 to l2_2, but t2 is at l2_5 after delivering p1. Let's correct this:

18. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
    After: t2 in l2_1
19. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
    After: p2 in t2, not in l2_1
20. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
    After: t2 in l2_2, p2 in t2
21. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
    After: p2 in l2_2, not in t2 (satisfying the goal for p2)

Constraint 4 says: "If 'p2 is in l2_1' holds in some state s, then either 'p2 is in l1_2' or 'p1 is in l2_2' must hold at s or at some state after s." Since p1 is in l2_2 in state 5, after p2 is in l2_1 in state 17, the constraint is satisfied.

Let's review all the constraints:
- Constraint 1: p2 should be in l2_2. Satisfied in state 21.
- Constraint 2: Before p2 is in l2_2, either p1 or p2 must be in l1_3. p2 is in l1_3 in state 11, before p2 is in l2_2 in state 21. Satisfied.
- Constraint 3: p2 should be in l2_1. Satisfied in state 17.
- Constraint 4: If p2 is in l2_1, then either p2 is in l1_2 or p1 is in l2_2 at that state or later. p2 is in l2_1 in state 17, and p1 is in l2_2 in state 5. Hmm, actually, this is a problem because state 5 is before state 17. Let's revise.
- Constraint 5: Either p1 is in l1_2 or p1 is in l2_4. p1 is in l2_4 in state 3. Satisfied.

To satisfy constraint 4, we need p1 to be in l2_2 after p2 is in l2_1, or p2 to be in l1_2 after p2 is in l2_1.

Let's revise our plan:

Initial state:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_4.
- Truck t2 is in location l2_5.
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1.
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1.
- Package p1 is in location l2_3.
- Package p2 is in location l1_4.

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1
3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (satisfying constraint 2)
4. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
5. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
6. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
7. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
8. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
9. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (satisfying constraint 3)

10. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_3 c2
11. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
12. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2 (satisfying constraint 5)
13. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2
14. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (satisfying constraint 4)
15. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
16. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
17. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
18. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (satisfying the goal for p2)
19. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
20. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
21. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
22. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (satisfying the goal for p1)

Hmm, I see another issue in my plan. After step 14, p1 is in l2_2, not in t2 anymore. Let me correct the plan.

Initial state:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_4.
- Truck t2 is in location l2_5.
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1.
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1.
- Package p1 is in location l2_3.
- Package p2 is in location l1_4.

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1
3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (satisfying constraint 2)
4. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
5. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
6. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
7. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
8. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
9. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (satisfying constraint 3)

10. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_3 c2
11. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
12. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2 (satisfying constraint 5)
13. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2
14. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (satisfying constraint 4)
15. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
16. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
17. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
18. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (satisfying the goal for p2)
19. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
20. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
21. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (satisfying the goal for p1)

This seems to work better, but I still see a problem: after step 14, p1 is in l2_2 and t2 is also in l2_2. Then the truck moves to l2_1 in step 15, but p1 is still at l2_2. In step 19, we try to load p1 into t2 in l2_2, but t2 is at l2_2 only in step 17.

Let me revise one more time:

Initial state:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_4.
- Truck t2 is in location l2_5.
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1.
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1.
- Package p1 is in location l2_3.
- Package p2 is in location l1_4.

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1
3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (satisfying constraint 2)
4. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
5. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
6. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
7. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
8. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
9. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (satisfying constraint 3)

10. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_3 c2
11. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
12. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2 (satisfying constraint 5)
13. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2
14. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (satisfying constraint 4)
15. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
16. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
17. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
18. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (satisfying the goal for p2)
19. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
20. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
21. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
22. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
23. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (satisfying the goal for p1)

But I'm adding unnecessary steps. After delivering p2 to l2_2, I can just drive t2 back to l2_2, load p1, and drive to l2_5.

Initial state:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_4.
- Truck t2 is in location l2_5.
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1.
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1.
- Package p1 is in location l2_3.
- Package p2 is in location l1_4.

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1
3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (satisfying constraint 2)
4. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
5. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
6. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
7. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
8. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
9. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (satisfying constraint 3)

10. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_3 c2
11. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
12. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2 (satisfying constraint 5)
13. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2
14. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (satisfying constraint 4)
15. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
16. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
17. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
18. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (satisfying the goal for p2)
19. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
20. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
21. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (satisfying the goal for p1)

Let's double-check this plan:

Constraint 1: p2 should be in l2_2. Satisfied in step 18.
Constraint 2: Before p2 is in l2_2, either p1 or p2 must be in l1_3. p2 is in l1_3 in step 3, before p2 is in l2_2 in step 18. Satisfied.
Constraint 3: p2 should be in l2_1. Satisfied in step 9.
Constraint 4: If p2 is in l2_1, then either p2 is in l1_2 or p1 is in l2_2 at that state or later. p2 is in l2_1 in step 9, and p1 is in l2_2 in step 14, which is after step 9. Satisfied.
Constraint 5: Either p1 is in l1_2 or p1 is in l2_4. p1 is in l2_4 in step 12. Satisfied.

But I think I still have an issue. In step 19, I'm trying to load p1 into t2 at l2_2, but I also unloaded p1 at l2_2 earlier (step 14). So p1 is at l2_2, but is t2 still at l2_2 after unloading p2? Yes, after step 18, t2 is still at l2_2, so step 19 is valid. The plan should work.

Actually there's another issue. My constraints were misunderstood:

Constraint 2: If p2 is in l2_2, then there must be an earlier state where either p1 or p2 is in l1_3.
Constraint 3: At some point, p2 should be in l2_1.
Constraint 4: If p2 is in l2_1, then either p2 should be in l1_2 or p1 should be in l2_2 at that state or afterward.
Constraint 5: At some point, either p1 should be in l1_2 or p1 should be in l2_4.

The issue is with constraint 4: If p2 is in l2_1, then either p2 should be in l1_2 or p1 should be in l2_2 at that state or afterward.

In my plan, after p2 is in l2_1 (step 9), p1 becomes in l2_2 (step 14), so the constraint is satisfied. So the plan is valid for constraint 4.

Let me double-check the constraint 2 again: If p2 is in l2_2, then there must be an earlier state where either p1 or p2 is in l1_3.

In my plan, p2 is in l2_2 in step 18, and p2 is in l1_3 in step 3, which is earlier. So the constraint is satisfied.

Let's review the entire plan:

Initial state:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_4.
- Truck t2 is in location l2_5.
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1.
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1.
- Package p1 is in location l2_3.
- Package p2 is in location l1_4.

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1
3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (satisfying constraint 2)
4. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
5. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
6. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
7. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
8. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
9. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (satisfying constraint 3)

10. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_3 c2
11. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
12. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2 (satisfying constraint 5)
13. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2
14. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (satisfying constraint 4)
15. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
16. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
17. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
18. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (satisfying the goal for p2)
19. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
20. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
21. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (satisfying the goal for p1)

I think this is a valid plan. Let's summarize the key steps:

1. We first move p2 from l1_4 to l1_3 (satisfying constraint 2), then to the airport l1_1, fly to l2_1 (satisfying constraint 3), and then truck to l2_2 (satisfying the goal for p2).
2. We move p1 from l2_3 to l2_4 (satisfying constraint 5), then to l2_2 (satisfying constraint 4), and finally to l2_5 (satisfying the goal for p1).

All the constraints and goals are satisfied.

Wait, there's another issue I missed: in the original action definitions, "loadairplane" and "unloadairplane" seem to be mentioned twice, and one of them should likely be "unloadairplane" (Load is mentioned in actions 2 and 4, and the description for action 4 says "unload"). I'll adjust the actions in my plan accordingly.

Here's the corrected plan:

Initial state:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_4.
- Truck t2 is in location l2_5.
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1.
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1.
- Package p1 is in location l2_3.
- Package p2 is in location l1_4.

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1
3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (satisfying constraint 2)
4. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
5. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
6. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
7. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
8. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
9. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (satisfying constraint 3)

10. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_3 c2
11. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
12. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2 (satisfying constraint 5)
13. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2
14. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (satisfying constraint 4)
15. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
16. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
17. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
18. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (satisfying the goal for p2)
19. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
20. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
21. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (satisfying the goal for p1)

This plan uses the correct action names and should satisfy all the constraints and goals.

21. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
    Preconditions: t2 is at l2_5, p1 is in t2. True.
    Effects: p1 is at l2_5, p1 is not in t2.

Final state:
- p1 is at l2_5.
- p2 is at l2_2.

This matches the goal state, and we've satisfied all the constraints:
- Constraint 1: p2 is in l2_2. Satisfied in step 18.
- Constraint 2: If p2 is in l2_2, then there must be an earlier state where either p1 or p2 is in l1_3. Satisfied because p2 is in l1_3 in state 3, before p2 is in l2_2 in state 18.
- Constraint 3: p2 should be in l2_1. Satisfied in step 9.
- Constraint 4: If p2 is in l2_1, then either p2 should be in l1_2 or p1 should be in l2_2 at that state or afterward. p2 is in l2_1 in state 9, and p1 is in l2_2 in state 14, which is after state 9. Satisfied.
- Constraint 5: At some point, either p1 should be in l1_2 or p1 should be in l2_4. p1 is in l2_4 in state 12 (it's in t2 which is at l2_4). Satisfied.

I think this plan is valid and optimal.

Actually, let me make one adjustment to constraint 5. The constraint says "At least one of the following conditions is true: 'Package p1 is in location l1_2', 'Package p1 is in location l2_4'", but when a package is in a truck, it's not considered to be at the location (it's in the truck). So actually p1 is never "in location l2_4" in my plan, it's in the truck t2 when t2 is at l2_4. So let me adjust the plan:

Initial state:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_4.
- Truck t2 is in location l2_5.
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1.
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1.
- Package p1 is in location l2_3.
- Package p2 is in location l1_4.

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1
3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (satisfying constraint 2)
4. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
5. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
6. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
7. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
8. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
9. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (satisfying constraint 3)

10. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_3 c2
11. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
12. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
13. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (satisfying constraint 5)
14. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
15. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2
16. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (satisfying constraint 4)
17. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
18. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
19. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
20. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (satisfying the goal for p2)
21. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
22. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
23. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (satisfying the goal for p1)

This adds 2 steps (13 and 14), but should now properly satisfy constraint 5.

Let's double-check:
- Constraint 1: p2 is in l2_2. Satisfied in step 20.
- Constraint 2: If p2 is in l2_2, then there must be an earlier state where either p1 or p2 is in l1_3. Satisfied because p2 is in l1_3 in state 3, before p2 is in l2_2 in state 20.
- Constraint 3: p2 should be in l2_1. Satisfied in step 9.
- Constraint 4: If p2 is in l2_1, then either p2 should be in l1_2 or p1 should be in l2_2 at that state or afterward. p2 is in l2_1 in state 9, and p1 is in l2_2 in state 16, which is after state 9. Satisfied.
- Constraint 5: At some point, either p1 should be in l1_2 or p1 should be in l2_4. p1 is in l2_4 in state 13. Satisfied.

I think this plan is valid and optimal.
