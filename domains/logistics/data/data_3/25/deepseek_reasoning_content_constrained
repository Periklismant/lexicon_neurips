Okay, let's see. I need to figure out a plan to get p1 to l2_5 and p2 to l1_2, while satisfying all the constraints. Let me start by understanding the initial state and the goal.

First, the initial state:

Packages:
- p1 is in l2_3 (city c2)
- p2 is in l1_1 (city c1, which is an airport)
- t1 is in l1_2 (city c1)
- t2 is in l2_4 (city c2)
- a1 is in l1_1 (airport)
- a2 is in l2_1 (airport)

Trucks:
- t1 is in c1's locations
- t2 is in c2's locations

Airplanes:
- a1 is in l1_1 (c1's airport)
- a2 is in l2_1 (c2's airport)

The goal is:
- p1 in l2_5 (c2)
- p2 in l1_2 (c1)

Constraints:

1. At some state, p2 is in a2 and p1 is in l1_2.
2. At some state, p2 is in l2_3.
3. At some state, p2 is in l1_2.
4. If p2 is in l1_2 in some state, then in an earlier state, p1 is in l2_1 or l1_5.

So, let's break down the steps needed for each package.

Starting with p1: it's in l2_3 (c2). We need to get it to l2_5. Since l2_5 is in c2, maybe using truck t2 which is in l2_4. But first, we need to get p1 to a truck that can move it to l2_5. Alternatively, maybe using airplane a2 if needed, but since it's within the same city, a truck would be better.

Wait, l2_3 is in c2. t2 is in l2_4. So maybe drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_3, load p1 into t2, drive to l2_5, unload. That seems straightforward. Let me check:

- Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_3 (possible, same city c2).
- Load p1 into t2 at l2_3.
- Drive t2 to l2_5.
- Unload p1 at l2_5.

But wait, the initial position of t2 is l2_4. So yes, that works.

Now for p2: starts in l1_1 (airport of c1). Needs to go to l1_2. Since l1_1 and l1_2 are in c1, we can use truck t1, which is in l1_2. Wait, but t1 is in l1_2. So to load p2 into t1, we need to have t1 at l1_1. Wait, no. Wait, p2 is in l1_1. To load p2 into a truck, the truck needs to be at l1_1. But t1 is in l1_2. So we need to drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1, load p2, then drive back to l1_2 and unload. But that seems possible.

Wait, but maybe using an airplane? Because l1_1 is an airport. Let's see. If we load p2 into a1 (airplane at l1_1), fly it to another airport, but the goal is in c1. Alternatively, maybe use a1 to transport p2 to another city and then back? But that would complicate. Let's think. The constraints also require that at some point p2 is in l2_3. So perhaps p2 has to go through l2_3. Also, the first constraint requires that p2 is in a2 and p1 is in l1_2 at some state. Hmm, that complicates things.

Let's tackle the constraints one by one.

Constraint 1: At some state, p2 in a2 and p1 in l1_2.

So p2 needs to be loaded into a2. But a2 is in l2_1 (c2's airport). So to get p2 into a2, we need to have p2 transported to l2_1 and then loaded into a2. Then, at the same time, p1 must be in l1_2. But how can p1 be in l1_2? Because p1 starts in l2_3 (c2). To get p1 to l1_2 (c1), it would need to be transported via airplane. For example, load p1 into a2, fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1, unload p1, then use truck t1 to take it to l1_2. But that might be part of the plan. But this seems complicated.

Wait, but the goal is p1 in l2_5 (c2), so maybe that's not needed. Wait, no, the goal is p1 in l2_5 (c2). So how would p1 ever be in l1_2 (c1) unless it's moved there? But the goal requires p1 in l2_5. So the constraint says that at some point, p1 is in l1_2. But that's conflicting with the goal. Wait, no. Wait, the constraint says that in at least one state, both p2 is in a2 and p1 is in l1_2. But the goal is p1 in l2_5, which is in c2. So how can p1 be in l1_2 (c1) during the plan? Because the initial position of p1 is in c2. So this suggests that p1 has to be moved to c1, then later back to c2? That complicates things.

Wait, maybe the plan is:

For p1: take it from l2_3 (c2) to l2_1 (airport) via truck t2. Then load into a2, fly to l1_1 (c1's airport), unload, then use truck t1 to take it to l1_2. Then, later, transport it back to c2. But the goal is to have p1 in l2_5. So after moving p1 to l1_2 (to satisfy the constraint), we need to move it back to c2. That's a lot of steps. But maybe necessary.

Similarly, for p2: it's in l1_1. To get to a2 (which is in l2_1), we need to fly p2 from l1_1 to l2_1 via a1. Load p2 into a1, fly to l2_1, unload, then load into a2. But then, we have p2 in a2. Then, maybe later unload it somewhere else. But the goal is to have p2 in l1_2, so perhaps after being in a2, p2 is flown back to c1's airport, then moved via truck to l1_2.

But this is getting complicated. Let's outline possible steps.

First, handle the constraints:

Constraint 1: p2 in a2 and p1 in l1_2 at some state.

To get p2 into a2:

- p2 starts in l1_1 (c1). a1 is there. Load p2 into a1, fly a1 to l2_1 (c2's airport). Then unload p2 into l2_1. Then load p2 into a2 (since a2 is at l2_1). So actions:

loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

Now, p2 is in a2. At this point, if we have p1 in l1_2, then the constraint is satisfied. But how to get p1 to l1_2?

p1 starts in l2_3 (c2). To get it to l1_2 (c1), we need to move it via airplane. So:

Load p1 into a2 (which is in l2_1). But how?

First, move p1 from l2_3 to l2_1. Use truck t2:

t2 is in l2_4. Drive to l2_3, load p1, drive to l2_1.

Actions:

drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2

loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2 (wait, but l2_1 is an airport in c2. Is l2_1 part of c2's locations? Yes. So driving t2 from l2_3 to l2_1 is allowed. Then, unload p1 in l2_1.

unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

Then load p1 into a2 (which is at l2_1):

loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

Fly a2 to l1_1:

flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

Unload p1 into l1_1.

unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

Then, use truck t1 (in l1_2) to drive to l1_1, load p1, drive back to l1_2.

drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1

loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1

unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2

At this point, p1 is in l1_2. Also, p2 is in a2 (loaded earlier). So this satisfies constraint 1: p2 in a2 and p1 in l1_2.

But now, we need to get p1 back to c2's l2_5. So after this, we need to move p1 back.

So fly a2 (which is in l1_1 now) back to l2_1 with p1? Wait, but after unloading p1 in l1_1, a2 is in l1_1. To fly back, we can load p1 into a2 again.

But wait, after p1 is in l1_2 (from truck t1), how do we get it back? Maybe:

After p1 is in l1_2 (from truck t1), load it back into t1, drive to l1_1, unload, load into a2, fly to l2_1, unload, then use truck t2 to take it to l2_5.

But this adds more steps. But maybe necessary.

But this seems lengthy, but let's see if we can fit all constraints.

Now, constraint 2: p2 must be in l2_3 at some state. So after p2 is in a2 (as per constraint 1), we can unload it into l2_3. But how? Because a2 is in l2_1. To get p2 to l2_3, maybe we need to fly a2 to l2_3? Wait, but l2_3 is not an airport. Airplanes can only land at airports. So airports are l1_1 and l2_1. So airplanes can't go to non-airport locations. Therefore, to get p2 into l2_3, we need to unload it from a2 into l2_1 (the airport), then use a truck to move it to l2_3. So:

After loading p2 into a2 (in l2_1), fly a2 to l2_1 (no, already there). Wait, no, a2 is in l2_1. So after loading p2 into a2, if we want to get it to l2_3, we need to unload it from a2 into l2_1, then load into truck t2, drive to l2_3, unload. Then, that would satisfy constraint 2. But then, how to get p2 to l1_2 in the end.

But let's think step by step.

Constraint 3: p2 in l1_2 at some state. Which is also the goal. So that's covered in the final state.

Constraint 4: If p2 is in l1_2 in some state, then in an earlier state, p1 was in l2_1 or l1_5.

In our current plan, when p2 is in l1_2 (the goal), we need to check if in an earlier state p1 was in l2_1 or l1_5.

In the steps we thought of earlier, when p1 is unloaded at l1_1 from a2, then driven to l1_2 via t1. So before that, when p1 was in l2_1 (after being unloaded from t2), that's one of the required locations. So that would satisfy constraint 4. Because when p2 is in l1_2 (final state), there was a previous state where p1 was in l2_1 (when it was unloaded from t2 into l2_1).

Wait, but in the steps above, after p1 is unloaded from t2 into l2_1, then loaded into a2 and flown to l1_1. So the state where p1 is in l2_1 is before being loaded into a2. So that would satisfy the condition for constraint 4.

Now, putting it all together:

Let's outline the steps:

For p1:

1. Move p1 from l2_3 to l2_1 using t2:
   a. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_3.
   b. Load p1 into t2.
   c. Drive t2 to l2_1.
   d. Unload p1 into l2_1.

2. Load p1 into a2 at l2_1.
3. Fly a2 to l1_1.
4. Unload p1 into l1_1.
5. Use t1 to move p1 from l1_1 to l1_2:
   a. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1.
   b. Load p1 into t1.
   c. Drive back to l1_2.
   d. Unload p1 into l1_2. (This satisfies constraint 1 when p2 is in a2 and p1 is here)

But at this point, p1 is in l1_2, but the goal is to have it in l2_5. So need to move it back.

6. Load p1 back into t1, drive to l1_1.
7. Load p1 into a1 (which is at l1_1).
8. Fly a1 to l2_1.
9. Unload p1 into l2_1.
10. Load into t2 (which is in l2_1 now).
11. Drive t2 to l2_5.
12. Unload p1 into l2_5. (Goal achieved.)

For p2:

1. Start in l1_1. Load into a1.
2. Fly a1 to l2_1.
3. Unload p2 into l2_1.
4. Load into a2 (constraint 1: p2 in a2).
5. Now, to satisfy constraint 2 (p2 in l2_3), unload p2 from a2 into l2_1 (but a2 is in l2_1), then load into t2, drive to l2_3, unload.
   a. Unload p2 from a2 into l2_1.
   b. Load p2 into t2.
   c. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_3.
   d. Unload p2 into l2_3. (Constraint 2 satisfied)
6. Now, need to get p2 back to l1_2. How? Maybe:
   a. Load p2 into t2 again, drive to l2_1.
   b. Load into a2, fly to l1_1.
   c. Unload into l1_1.
   d. Use t1 (which is in l1_2) to drive to l1_1, load p2, drive back to l1_2, unload. (Goal achieved.)

But wait, but after step 5d, p2 is in l2_3. Then, moving it back to l1_2 would require flying again. But that's a lot of steps.

Alternatively, maybe after p2 is in l2_3 (constraint 2), we can use a different path. Let's see.

Wait, the goal for p2 is l1_2. So after getting p2 into l2_3 (to satisfy constraint 2), we need to move it back to c1's l1_2. So steps could be:

From l2_3:

a. Load p2 into t2 (if t2 is there). But after step 5d, t2 is in l2_3. So:

Load p2 into t2 at l2_3.

Drive t2 to l2_1 (airport).

Unload p2 into l2_1.

Load into a2.

Fly a2 to l1_1.

Unload p2 into l1_1.

Then, use t1 to take p2 to l1_2.

But t1 is in l1_2. So drive t1 to l1_1, load p2, drive back.

So that's possible.

Putting all these steps together, let's see the sequence.

But this seems very long. Is there a shorter way?

Alternatively, maybe combining steps. Let's see.

Let's try to outline the entire plan step by step, considering all constraints and goals.

1. Load p2 into a1 at l1_1.

   loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

2. Fly a1 to l2_1.

   flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

3. Unload p2 into l2_1.

   unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

4. Load p2 into a2 at l2_1.

   loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

   Now, p2 is in a2. To satisfy constraint 1, we need p1 in l1_2. So let's handle p1 now.

5. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_3 (p1 is here).

   drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2

6. Load p1 into t2.

   loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

7. Drive t2 to l2_1.

   drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

8. Unload p1 into l2_1.

   unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

9. Load p1 into a2.

   loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

10. Fly a2 to l1_1.

    flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

11. Unload p1 into l1_1.

    unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

12. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1.

    drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1

13. Load p1 into t1.

    loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

14. Drive t1 back to l1_2.

    drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1

15. Unload p1 into l1_2.

    unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2

    At this point, constraint 1 is satisfied: p2 is in a2 (step 4) and p1 is in l1_2 (step 15). But wait, after step 4, p2 is in a2. But step 15 happens later. So the state after step 4 has p2 in a2, but p1 is not yet in l1_2. The state after step 15 has p1 in l1_2, but p2 is no longer in a2 (since step 4 was earlier, and step 5-15 involve moving p1). Wait, no. After step 4, p2 is in a2. Then steps 5-15 involve moving p1. So during step 4, p2 is loaded into a2. Then, after step 15, p1 is in l1_2, but p2 is still in a2 (if we didn't unload it). Wait, no. After step 4, a2 is at l2_1 with p2 loaded. Then step 10 flies a2 to l1_1. When you fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1, the airplane moves, and any packages inside stay in it. So after step 10, a2 is in l1_1, and p2 is still in a2. Then, after step 15, p1 is in l1_2, and p2 is still in a2 (since we haven't unloaded it yet). So at step 15, both p2 is in a2 (which is now in l1_1) and p1 is in l1_2. So that satisfies constraint 1.

So that's good.

Now, we need to satisfy constraint 2: p2 in l2_3. So after this, we need to move p2 to l2_3.

16. Fly a2 from l1_1 back to l2_1.

    flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1

17. Unload p2 from a2 into l2_1.

    unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

18. Load p2 into t2 (which is in l2_1 after step 7).

    loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

19. Drive t2 to l2_3.

    drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2

20. Unload p2 into l2_3. (Constraint 2 satisfied)

    unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3

Now, to get p2 to l1_2 (goal), we need to move it back to c1.

21. Load p2 into t2 again.

    loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3

22. Drive t2 to l2_1.

    drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

23. Unload p2 into l2_1.

    unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

24. Load p2 into a2.

    loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

25. Fly a2 to l1_1.

    flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

26. Unload p2 into l1_1.

    unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

27. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1.

    drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1

28. Load p2 into t1.

    loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

29. Drive t1 back to l1_2.

    drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1

30. Unload p2 into l1_2. (Goal achieved)

    unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

Meanwhile, p1 is still in l1_2 from step 15. But the goal requires p1 to be in l2_5. So after step 15, we need to move p1 back to c2.

Let's insert steps to handle p1 after step 15.

After step 15, p1 is in l1_2. Need to get it to l2_5.

16. Load p1 into t1 (still in l1_2).

    loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2

17. Drive t1 to l1_1.

    drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1

18. Unload p1 into l1_1.

    unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

19. Load p1 into a1 (which is at l1_1).

    loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

20. Fly a1 to l2_1.

    flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

21. Unload p1 into l2_1.

    unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

22. Load p1 into t2 (which is in l2_1 after step 22).

    loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

23. Drive t2 to l2_5.

    drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2

24. Unload p1 into l2_5. (Goal achieved)

    unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

But this sequence is getting very long. Let's check if all constraints are met.

Constraint 1: After step 15, p1 is in l1_2 and p2 is in a2 (which is in l1_1 after step 10). Wait, no. After step 10, a2 is in l1_1, but in step 16, we fly a2 back to l2_1. So the state after step 15 has a2 in l1_1 with p2 inside. So at that state, p2 is in a2 and p1 is in l1_2. So constraint 1 is satisfied.

Constraint 2: After step 20, p2 is in l2_3.

Constraint 3: After step 30, p2 is in l1_2 (goal), and possibly other states.

Constraint 4: When p2 is in l1_2 (step 30), there must be an earlier state where p1 is in l2_1 or l1_5. Looking back, p1 was in l2_1 during step 8 and step 21. So that's satisfied.

Now, the plan must be optimal. But this seems quite long. Maybe there's a shorter way.

Alternative approach: Can we satisfy the constraints with fewer steps?

Let's think again.

Constraint 1: p2 in a2 and p1 in l1_2 at the same time.

If we can have p2 loaded into a2 (l2_1) and p1 moved to l1_2, perhaps during different times. But the constraint requires that in at least one state, both are true. So they can be true at different times. Wait, no. The constraint says "The following conditions are all true: ..." So both must be true in the same state.

So p2 must be in a2 and p1 in l1_2 in the same state.

So how can that happen?

p1 is moved to l1_2 (c1), and p2 is in a2 (which is in l2_1 or elsewhere? Or a2 could be in another location, but p2 is inside it.

But to have both true in the same state, a2 can be anywhere, but p2 is inside it. So perhaps:

- Fly a2 to l1_1 with p2 inside. Then, at that point, a2 is in l1_1, p2 is in a2. If p1 is in l1_2, then that state would satisfy the constraint.

But how to get there.

Alternatively:

Load p2 into a2 in l2_1, then fly a2 to l1_1. Then, in l1_1, unload p2 into l1_1. But during the time when a2 is in l1_1 and p2 is still in a2 (before unloading), if p1 is in l1_2, that would satisfy the constraint.

So perhaps:

Move p1 to l1_2 first, then have a2 arrive with p2.

But how to coordinate.

Alternatively:

- Load p2 into a2 at l2_1.

- Fly a2 to l1_1. Now, a2 is in l1_1 with p2 inside.

- Now, move p1 to l1_2. While a2 is in l1_1 with p2 inside, and p1 is in l1_2, that's the state we need.

But p1 starts in l2_3. To get it to l1_2, we need to move it via airplane.

So steps could be:

1. Load p1 into t2 (l2_3), drive to l2_1.

2. Load p1 into a2, fly to l1_1.

3. Unload p1 into l1_1, use t1 to drive to l1_2.

4. Meanwhile, load p2 into a1, fly to l2_1.

5. Load p2 into a2, fly to l1_1.

At this point, a2 is in l1_1 with p2 inside. p1 is in l1_2. So the state after step 5 is a2 in l1_1 (with p2), and p1 in l1_2. So constraint 1 is satisfied.

Then, proceed to move p2 to l2_3 and back.

This approach might have fewer steps.

Let me outline this plan:

For p1:

1. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_3.

   drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2

2. Load p1 into t2.

   loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

3. Drive t2 to l2_1.

   drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

4. Unload p1 into l2_1.

   unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

5. Load p1 into a2.

   loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

6. Fly a2 to l1_1.

   flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

7. Unload p1 into l1_1.

   unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

8. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1.

   drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1

9. Load p1 into t1.

   loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

10. Drive t1 to l1_2.

    drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1

11. Unload p1 into l1_2. (Now p1 is in l1_2)

    unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2

For p2:

12. Load p2 into a1 (at l1_1).

    loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

13. Fly a1 to l2_1.

    flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

14. Unload p2 into l2_1.

    unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

15. Load p2 into a2 (which is in l1_1 now? Wait, no. After step 6, a2 was flown to l1_1. So after step 6, a2 is in l1_1. So steps 12-14 are after step 6. So when we load p2 into a2 in step 15, a2 is in l1_1. But p2 is in l2_1 after step 14. So we need to move a2 back to l2_1.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me rethink.

Alternative approach for p2:

After p1 is in l1_2 (step 11), we need to get p2 into a2. So:

12. Load p2 into a1 (at l1_1), fly to l2_1.

    loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

    flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

    unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

13. Load p2 into a2 (which is in l1_1? No, a2 is in l1_1 after step 6. So to load p2 into a2, we need a2 to be in l2_1. But after step 6, a2 is in l1_1. So to load p2 into a2, we need to fly a2 back to l2_1.

So after step 11:

14. Fly a2 from l1_1 to l2_1.

    flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1

15. Load p2 into a2 at l2_1.

    loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

16. Now, to have p2 in a2 and p1 in l1_2, we need to have a2 in l2_1 (after step 14) and p1 in l1_2 (step 11). So the state after step 15: p2 is in a2 (l2_1), p1 in l1_2. But they are in different locations, so the conditions are true, but in different cities. But the constraint says "the following conditions are all true: p2 is in a2, p1 is in l1_2". Since a2 is in l2_1, p2 is in a2 (regardless of where a2 is). So the state after step 15 satisfies constraint 1: p2 in a2 and p1 in l1_2. Yes.

Then, we need to satisfy constraint 2: p2 in l2_3.

17. Unload p2 from a2 into l2_1.

    unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

18. Load p2 into t2 (which is in l2_1 after step 3).

19. Drive t2 to l2_3.

20. Unload p2 into l2_3. (Constraint 2)

    unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3

Now, move p2 to l1_2:

21. Load p2 into t2.

    loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3

22. Drive t2 to l2_1.

    drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

23. Unload p2 into l2_1.

24. Load p2 into a2.

25. Fly a2 to l1_1.

    flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

26. Unload p2 into l1_1.

    unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

27. Drive t1 to l1_1.

    drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1

28. Load p2 into t1.

    loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

29. Drive t1 to l1_2.

    drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1

30. Unload p2 into l1_2. (Goal)

    unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

Meanwhile, p1 is in l1_2 (step 11), but needs to be moved to l2_5.

31. Load p1 into t1.

    loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2

32. Drive t1 to l1_1.

    drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1

33. Unload p1 into l1_1.

    unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

34. Load p1 into a1.

    loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

35. Fly a1 to l2_1.

    flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

36. Unload p1 into l2_1.

    unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

37. Load p1 into t2.

    loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

38. Drive t2 to l2_5.

    drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2

39. Unload p1 into l2_5. (Goal)

    unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

This plan is very long, but it covers all constraints. However, maybe there's a more optimal way.

Wait, what if we combine some steps. For example, after moving p1 to l1_2, and p2 to a2, can we unload p2 into l2_3 via a2? But airplanes can only land at airports. So no, a2 can't go to l2_3. So we have to use trucks.

Alternative idea: When p2 is in a2 (step 15), fly a2 to l2_1, unload p2 into l2_1, then use truck to move to l2_3. Then, for the goal, move p2 back to l1_2 via airplane and truck.

But this is similar to what we have.

Alternatively, perhaps use a different order.

Let me try to find a shorter plan.

Consider the following steps:

1. Load p2 into a1 at l1_1.

2. Fly a1 to l2_1.

3. Unload p2 into l2_1.

4. Load p2 into a2 (now in l2_1).

5. Fly a2 to l1_1. Now, a2 is in l1_1 with p2 inside.

6. Now, move p1 to l1_2.

   a. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_3, load p1, drive to l2_1, load into a2, fly to l1_1, unload, use t1 to move to l1_2.

7. At this point, a2 is in l1_1 with p2 inside, and p1 is in l1_2. So constraint 1 is met.

8. Unload p2 from a2 into l1_1.

9. Use t1 to move p2 to l1_2 (but that's the goal, but need to satisfy constraint 2).

But constraint 2 requires p2 to be in l2_3. So after step 5, p2 is in a2 (l1_1). To get it to l2_3:

   a. Fly a2 back to l2_1.

   b. Unload p2 into l2_1.

   c. Load into t2, drive to l2_3, unload.

   d. Then move back.

This is similar to the previous plan.

Alternatively, maybe during the movement of p1, p2 can be routed through l2_3.

But I'm not seeing a way to reduce steps. Given the constraints, perhaps this is the minimal plan.

But let's check if there's a way to have fewer steps.

Another approach: Use a2 to transport p2 to l2_1, then move to l2_3 via t2. But that requires the steps we already have.

Alternatively, after loading p2 into a2 (l2_1), fly a2 to l1_1, unload p2 into l1_1, then move p2 to l1_2 via t1. But that would satisfy the goal, but how to satisfy constraint 2 (p2 in l2_3). So we have to send p2 to l2_3 first.

Thus, the steps seem necessary.

Considering all this, the optimal plan would have to include all these steps. However, perhaps there's a more optimal way.

Wait, in the initial plan I outlined earlier, maybe some steps can be merged or reordered.

For example, after moving p1 to l1_2, and p2 to a2 (in l1_1), perhaps we can fly a2 to l2_1, unload p2 there, move it to l2_3, then back to l2_1, then fly to l1_1 again, and then move to l1_2.

But this would require additional steps.

Alternatively, after p2 is in l2_3 (constraint 2), maybe use a different airplane or truck to move it back.

But I think the plan is as optimal as possible given the constraints.

Another thing to check is whether the constraints are met in the steps.

Constraint 4: If p2 is in l1_2, then earlier state where p1 is in l2_1 or l1_5.

In the final step when p2 is in l1_2 (step 30 in the first plan), the earlier state where p1 was in l2_1 is steps 4 and 21. So that's satisfied.

Thus, the plan meets all constraints.

Now, formatting the actions correctly.

Let me list the steps from the second approach, which seems more optimized.

The steps are:

1. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
2. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
3. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
4. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
5. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
6. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2
7. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
8. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
9. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
10. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
11. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
12. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
13. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
14. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
15. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
16. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2

At this point, p1 is in l1_2, and a2 is in l1_1 with p2 loaded (from step 4 and 5). Wait, no:

Wait, steps 4 and 5: after step 4, p2 is loaded into a2 at l2_1. Then step 5 flies a2 to l1_1. So after step 5, a2 is in l1_1 with p2 inside. Then step 10 loads p1 into a2 at l2_1. Wait, but step 5 is a2 flying to l1_1. So step 10 is trying to load p1 into a2 at l2_1, but a2 is in l1_1 at that point. This is a contradiction.

Ah, there's a mistake here. The previous steps were not correctly ordered. Let's correct this.

Correcting the steps:

After step 4 (p2 loaded into a2 at l2_1), step 5 is to fly a2 to l1_1. Then, p2 is in a2 in l1_1. To move p1 to l1_2, we need to load p1 into a2 in l2_1. But after flying a2 to l1_1, we can't load p1 into a2 there unless we fly a2 back. This indicates a mistake in the previous planning.

This suggests that the second approach is flawed. Therefore, the first approach is necessary.

Given this, I think the initial longer plan is necessary, despite the number of steps. Therefore, the correct plan must include all necessary steps to meet the constraints and goals.
