Let's understand the problem:

We have a logistics problem with two cities (c1, c2), a collection of locations within each city, including airports (l1_1 is airport in c1, l2_1 is airport in c2), and packages (p1, p2) that we need to move to specific destinations using trucks (t1, t2) and airplanes (a1, a2).

I note that in the original state, there's an issue: it says trucks (t1, t2) and airplanes (a1, a2) are all "packages" and in specific locations. I think this might be a mistake in the problem statement, and t1, t2, a1, a2 should be declared as being in specific locations, not as packages.

Let me assume the following correct initial state:
- "Truck t1 is in location l1_2"
- "Truck t2 is in location l2_4"
- "Airplane a1 is in location l1_1"
- "Airplane a2 is in location l2_1"
- "Package p1 is in location l2_3"
- "Package p2 is in location l1_1"

The goal is to get:
- "Package p1 is in location l2_5"
- "Package p2 is in location l1_2"

Additionally, we have the following constraints:
1. At some point, p2 must be in a2 and p1 must be in location l1_2.
2. At some point, p2 must be in location l2_3.
3. At some point, p2 must be in location l1_2 (which is also our final goal for p2).
4. If p2 is in location l1_2, there must have been an earlier state where p1 is in location l2_1 or location l1_5.

Let me think about this:

We start with:
- p1 in l2_3
- p2 in l1_1
- t1 in l1_2
- t2 in l2_4
- a1 in l1_1
- a2 in l2_1

We need to get:
- p1 in l2_5
- p2 in l1_2

And we have the constraints mentioned above.

Let's think about the constraints:
1. At some point, p2 must be in a2 and p1 must be in location l1_2.
   - So we need to load p2 into a2 and also move p1 to l1_2.
2. At some point, p2 must be in location l2_3.
   - We need to move p2 to l2_3 at some point.
3. At some point, p2 must be in location l1_2.
   - We need to move p2 to l1_2, which is also our final goal for p2.
4. If p2 is in location l1_2, there must have been an earlier state where p1 is in location l2_1 or location l1_5.
   - Before moving p2 to l1_2, we need to ensure p1 is in l2_1 or l1_5.

Alright, let's sketch a plan:

1. Start with p1 in l2_3, p2 in l1_1.
2. First, let's ensure p1 is in l2_1 or l1_5 to satisfy constraint 4.
   - Since p1 is in l2_3, we can use t2 to transport it to l2_1.
3. Now, we need to move p2. Since it's in l1_1, we can load it into a1.
4. Fly a1 to l2_1.
5. Unload p2 from a1 at l2_1.
6. Load p2 into a2 at l2_1 (to satisfy constraint 1).
7. Now, we need to fly a2 to a location from where p2 can be transported to l2_3 (for constraint 2). We can fly a2 to l2_1 (it's already there).
8. Unload p2 from a2 at l2_1.
9. Use t2 to transport p2 to l2_3.
10. Now, we need to get p1 to l1_2 (for constraint 1) and p2 to l1_2 (for constraint 3 and the goal).
    - Load p1 into a1 at l2_1.
    - Fly a1 to l1_1.
    - Unload p1 from a1 at l1_1.
    - Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1.
    - Load p1 into t1 at l1_1.
    - Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_2.
    - Unload p1 from t1 at l1_2 (Now the first part of constraint 1 is satisfied).
11. Now, for p2:
    - Load p2 into a2 at l2_3.
    - Fly a2 to l1_1.
    - Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1.
    - Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1.
    - Load p2 into t1 at l1_1.
    - Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_2.
    - Unload p2 from t1 at l1_2 (Now constraint 3 and the goal for p2 are satisfied).
12. Lastly, we need to move p1 to l2_5 (final goal for p1).
    - Load p1 into a1 at l1_2.
    - Fly a1 to l2_1.
    - Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1.
    - Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1.
    - Load p1 into t2 at l2_1.
    - Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_5.
    - Unload p1 from t2 at l2_5.

Now, let's check the entire plan again:

Wait, I think I made a mistake. I assumed that the trucks t1 and t2 and the airplanes a1 and a2 are in specific locations. But the problem description says they're packages. Let me reevaluate.

Actually, I'm going to go with my original assumption, that the correct initial state is:
- "Truck t1 is in location l1_2"
- "Truck t2 is in location l2_4"
- "Airplane a1 is in location l1_1"
- "Airplane a2 is in location l2_1"
- "Package p1 is in location l2_3"
- "Package p2 is in location l1_1"

Since the problem description specifically mentions "loadtruck" and "loadairplane", it makes more sense that t1 and t2 are trucks and a1 and a2 are airplanes, not packages.

Let me redo the planning with this assumption.

Also, I need to ensure that the constraint satisfaction order is correct. Let's be more rigorous:

1. Starting point:
   - p1 in l2_3
   - p2 in l1_1
   - t1 in l1_2
   - t2 in l2_4
   - a1 in l1_1
   - a2 in l2_1

2. Constraint 4 says that we need to have p1 in l2_1 or l1_5 before p2 is in l1_2.
   - Let's move p1 from l2_3 to l2_1.
   - Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_3.
   - Load p1 into t2 at l2_3.
   - Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1.
   - Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1.

3. Constraint 1 says that at some point, p2 must be in a2 and p1 must be in l1_2.
   - For p2, it's in l1_1, and we need to get it into a2.
   - Load p2 into a1 at l1_1.
   - Fly a1 to l2_1.
   - Unload p2 from a1 at l2_1.
   - Load p2 into a2 at l2_1.
   - Now p2 is in a2.
   - For p1, it's in l2_1, and we need to get it to l1_2.
   - Load p1 into a1 at l2_1.
   - Fly a1 to l1_1.
   - Unload p1 from a1 at l1_1.
   - Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1.
   - Load p1 into t1 at l1_1.
   - Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_2.
   - Unload p1 from t1 at l1_2.
   - At this point, p2 is in a2 and p1 is in l1_2, satisfying constraint 1.

4. Constraint 2 says that at some point, p2 must be in l2_3.
   - Currently, p2 is in a2.
   - Fly a2 from l2_1 to l2_1 (no actually it's already there, so we skip this step).
   - Unload p2 from a2 at l2_1.
   - Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_3.
   - Load p2 into t2 at l2_3.
   - Unload p2 from t2 at l2_3.
   - Now p2 is in l2_3, satisfying constraint 2.

5. Constraint 3 says that at some point, p2 must be in l1_2.
   - Currently, p2 is in l2_3.
   - Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1.
   - Load p2 into t2 at l2_3.
   - Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1.
   - Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1.
   - Load p2 into a1 at l2_1.
   - Fly a1 to l1_1.
   - Unload p2 from a1 at l1_1.
   - Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1.
   - Load p2 into t1 at l1_1.
   - Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_2.
   - Unload p2 from t1 at l1_2.
   - Now p2 is in l1_2, satisfying constraint 3 and also the part of our goal.

6. Finally, we need to satisfy the remaining part of our goal: p1, which is in l1_2 right now, should be in l2_5.
   - Load p1 into t1 at l1_2.
   - Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1.
   - Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1.
   - Load p1 into a1 at l1_1.
   - Fly a1 to l2_1.
   - Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1.
   - Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_5.
   - Load p1 into t2 at l2_1.
   - Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_5.
   - Unload p1 from t2 at l2_5.
   - Now p1 is in l2_5, satisfying the other part of our goal.

Alright, now we have the final plan:

1. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_3.
2. Load p1 into t2 at l2_3.
3. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1.
4. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1.
5. Load p2 into a1 at l1_1.
6. Fly a1 to l2_1.
7. Unload p2 from a1 at l2_1.
8. Load p2 into a2 at l2_1.
9. Load p1 into a1 at l2_1.
10. Fly a1 to l1_1.
11. Unload p1 from a1 at l1_1.
12. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1.
13. Load p1 into t1 at l1_1.
14. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_2.
15. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_2.
16. Unload p2 from a2 at l2_1.
17. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_3.
18. Load p2 into t2 at l2_1.
19. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_3.
20. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_3.
21. Load p2 into t2 at l2_3.
22. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1.
23. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1.
24. Load p2 into a1 at l2_1.
25. Fly a1 to l1_1.
26. Unload p2 from a1 at l1_1.
27. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1.
28. Load p2 into t1 at l1_1.
29. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_2.
30. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_2.
31. Load p1 into t1 at l1_2.
32. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1.
33. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1.
34. Load p1 into a1 at l1_1.
35. Fly a1 to l2_1.
36. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1.
37. Load p1 into t2 at l2_1.
38. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_5.
39. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_5.

But this seems too long, let me optimize it.

First, let's understand what's necessary to satisfy the constraints:

1. Constraint 4 says that before p2 is in l1_2, p1 must have been in l2_1 or l1_5. This means we need to get p1 to one of these locations first.
2. Constraint 1 says that at some point, p2 must be in a2 and p1 must be in l1_2. Since "at some point" is vague, we can decide when this needs to happen in our plan.
3. Constraint 2 says that at some point, p2 must be in l2_3.
4. Constraint 3 says that at some point, p2 must be in l1_2, which aligns with our goal for p2.

Let's craft a streamlined plan:

1. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_3.
2. Load p1 into t2 at l2_3.
3. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1.
4. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1. (This satisfies the condition for constraint 4)
5. Load p1 into a1 at l2_1.
6. Fly a1 to l1_1.
7. Unload p1 from a1 at l1_1.
8. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1.
9. Load p1 into t1 at l1_1.
10. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_2.
11. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_2. (Partial satisfaction of constraint 1)
12. Load p2 into a1 at l1_1.
13. Fly a1 to l2_1.
14. Unload p2 from a1 at l2_1.
15. Load p2 into a2 at l2_1. (Now, both p2 is in a2 and p1 is in l1_2, satisfying constraint 1)
16. Fly a2 to l2_1.
17. Unload p2 from a2 at l2_1.
18. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_3.
19. Load p2 into t2 at l2_1.
20. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_3.
21. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_3. (This satisfies constraint 2)
22. Load p2 into t2 at l2_3.
23. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1.
24. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1.
25. Load p2 into a1 at l2_1.
26. Fly a1 to l1_1.
27. Unload p2 from a1 at l1_1.
28. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1.
29. Load p2 into t1 at l1_1.
30. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_2.
31. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_2. (This satisfies constraint 3 and the goal for p2)
32. Load p1 into t1 at l1_2.
33. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1.
34. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1.
35. Load p1 into a1 at l1_1.
36. Fly a1 to l2_1.
37. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1.
38. Load p1 into t2 at l2_1.
39. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_5.
40. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_5. (This satisfies the goal for p1)

Let me reconsider steps 16 through 17. a2 is already in l2_1, so we don't need to fly it there.

1. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_3.
2. Load p1 into t2 at l2_3.
3. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1.
4. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1. (This satisfies the condition for constraint 4)
5. Load p1 into a1 at l2_1.
6. Fly a1 to l1_1.
7. Unload p1 from a1 at l1_1.
8. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1.
9. Load p1 into t1 at l1_1.
10. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_2.
11. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_2. (Partial satisfaction of constraint 1)
12. Load p2 into a1 at l1_1.
13. Fly a1 to l2_1.
14. Unload p2 from a1 at l2_1.
15. Load p2 into a2 at l2_1. (Now, both p2 is in a2 and p1 is in l1_2, satisfying constraint 1)
16. Unload p2 from a2 at l2_1.
17. Load p2 into t2 at l2_1.
18. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_3.
19. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_3. (This satisfies constraint 2)
20. Load p2 into t2 at l2_3.
21. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1.
22. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1.
23. Load p2 into a1 at l2_1.
24. Fly a1 to l1_1.
25. Unload p2 from a1 at l1_1.
26. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1.
27. Load p2 into t1 at l1_1.
28. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_2.
29. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_2. (This satisfies constraint 3 and the goal for p2)
30. Load p1 into t1 at l1_2.
31. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1.
32. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1.
33. Load p1 into a1 at l1_1.
34. Fly a1 to l2_1.
35. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1.
36. Load p1 into t2 at l2_1.
37. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_5.
38. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_5. (This satisfies the goal for p1)

I still see a redundancy in steps 19 and 20 - we unload p2 from t2 at l2_3 and then immediately load it back. Let's streamline this by dividing it into parts:

1. First, we'll satisfy constraint 4 by moving p1 to l2_1.
2. Next, we'll position p1 at l1_2 to help with constraint 1.
3. We'll then maneuver p2 to satisfy constraints 1, 2, and 3 (and the goal for p2).
4. Finally, we'll move p1 to l2_5 to complete our goal.

Streamlined plan:

1. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_3.
2. Load p1 into t2 at l2_3.
3. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1.
4. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1. (This satisfies the condition for constraint 4)
5. Load p1 into a1 at l2_1.
6. Fly a1 to l1_1.
7. Unload p1 from a1 at l1_1.
8. Load p2 into a1 at l1_1.
9. Fly a1 to l2_1.
10. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1.
11. Unload p2 from a1 at l2_1.
12. Load p2 into a2 at l2_1.
13. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1.
14. Load p1 into t1 at l1_1.
15. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_2.
16. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_2. (Now, both p2 is in a2 and p1 is in l1_2, satisfying constraint 1)
17. Unload p2 from a2 at l2_1.
18. Load p2 into t2 at l2_1.
19. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_3.
20. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_3. (This satisfies constraint 2)
21. Load p2 into t2 at l2_3.
22. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1.
23. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1.
24. Load p2 into a1 at l2_1.
25. Fly a1 to l1_1.
26. Unload p2 from a1 at l1_1.
27. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1.
28. Load p2 into t1 at l1_1.
29. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_2.
30. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_2. (This satisfies constraint 3 and the goal for p2)
31. Load p1 into t1 at l1_2.
32. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1.
33. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1.
34. Load p1 into a1 at l1_1.
35. Fly a1 to l2_1.
36. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1.
37. Load p1 into t2 at l2_1.
38. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_5.
39. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_5. (This satisfies the goal for p1)

Wait, there's an inconsistency in steps 10 and 11. We can't unload both p1 and p2 from a1 without at least one load operation in between (since an airplane can only carry one package at a time). Let me correct this:

1. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_3.
2. Load p1 into t2 at l2_3.
3. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1.
4. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1. (This satisfies the condition for constraint 4)
5. Load p1 into a1 at l2_1.
6. Fly a1 to l1_1.
7. Unload p1 from a1 at l1_1.
8. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1.
9. Load p1 into t1 at l1_1.
10. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_2.
11. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_2.
12. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1.
13. Load p2 into t1 at l1_1.
14. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_2.
15. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_2. (This satisfies constraint 3)
16. Load p2 into t1 at l1_2.
17. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1.
18. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1.
19. Load p2 into a1 at l1_1.
20. Fly a1 to l2_1.
21. Unload p2 from a1 at l2_1.
22. Load p2 into a2 at l2_1. (Partial satisfaction of constraint 1)
23. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_2.
24. Drive t1, since p1 is still in l1_2, so the other part of constraint 1 is also satisfied and constraint 1 is complete.
25. Unload p2 from a2 at l2_1.
26. Load p2 into t2 at l2_1.
27. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_3.
28. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_3. (This satisfies constraint 2)
29. Load p2 into t2 at l2_3.
30. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1.
31. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1.
32. Load p2 into a1 at l2_1.
33. Fly a1 to l1_1.
34. Unload p2 from a1 at l1_1.
35. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1.
36. Load p2 into t1 at l1_1.
37. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_2.
38. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_2. (This reaffirms constraint 3 and achieves the goal for p2)
39. Load p1 into t1 at l1_2.
40. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1.
41. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1.
42. Load p1 into a1 at l1_1.
43. Fly a1 to l2_1.
44. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1.
45. Load p1 into t2 at l2_1.
46. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_5.
47. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_5. (This achieves the goal for p1)

Wait, I have steps 23 and 24 where t1 is moving but without any package operations. I need to correct this. 

Also, I'm being a bit too verbose. Let me clarify the constraints and draft a cleaner plan.

Constraint 1: At some point, p2 must be in a2 and p1 must be in l1_2.
Constraint 2: At some point, p2 must be in l2_3.
Constraint 3: At some point, p2 must be in l1_2 (which is also our final goal for p2).
Constraint 4: Before p2 is in l1_2, p1 must have been in l2_1 or l1_5.

Goal: p1 in l2_5, p2 in l1_2.

I already try to think of redundancies where we have p2 in l1_2 multiple times, or we have unnecessary loadings or unloadings. Additionally, we want to minimize airplane and truck movements.  Also, let me review if I'm making unjustified assumptions about whether airplanes and trucks can hold multiple packages simultaneously; I don't think I am, but let me double check: I'm assuming one package per truck or airplane at a time, which seems standard. Let me craft a streamlined plan:

1. First, by constraint 4, p1 should be in l2_1 or l1_5 before p2 is in l1_2. Let's get p1 to l2_1:
   - Since p1 is in l2_3, we'll use t2, which is in l2_4, to transport it to l2_1:
   - Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_3.
   - Load p1 into t2 at l2_3.
   - Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1.
   - Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1. (Now p1 is in l2_1, which sets up the condition for constraint 4)

2. By constraint 1, at some point p2 should be in a2 and p1 in l1_2. Let's position p1 in l1_2 first:
   - Load p1 into a1 at l2_1.
   - Fly a1 to l1_1.
   - Unload p1 from a1 at l1_1.
   - Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1.
   - Load p1 into t1 at l1_1.
   - Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_2.
   - Unload p1 from t1 at l1_2. (Now p1 is in l1_2, partially satisfying constraint 1)

3. Now, let's get p2 into a2 (and then eventually to l2_3 for constraint 2).
   - Since p2 is in l1_1, and a1 is now in l1_1, we can:
   - Load p2 into a1 at l1_1.
   - Fly a1 to l2_1.
   - Unload p2 from a1 at l2_1.
   - Load p2 into a2 at l2_1. (Now p2 is in a2, and p1 is in l1_2, satisfying constraint 1)

4. By constraint 2, p2 should be in l2_3 at some point. Let's move it there:
   - Unload p2 from a2 at l2_1.
   - Load p2 into t2 at l2_1.
   - Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_3.
   - Unload p2 from t2 at l2_3. (Now p2 is in l2_3, satisfying constraint 2)

5. Finally, let's position p2 in l1_2 (for constraint 3 and the goal) and p1 in l2_5 (for the goal):
   - Load p2 into t2 at l2_3.
   - Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1.
   - Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1.
   - Load p2 into a1 at l2_1.
   - Fly a1 to l1_1.
   - Unload p2 from a1 at l1_1.
   - Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1.
   - Load p2 into t1 at l1_1.
   - Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_2.
   - Unload p2 from t1 at l1_2. (Now p2 is in l1_2, satisfying constraint 3 and the goal for p2)

6. Now, let's move p1 to l2_5:
   - Load p1 into t1 at l1_2.
   - Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1.
   - Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1.
   - Load p1 into a1 at l1_1.
   - Fly a1 to l2_1.
   - Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1.
   - Load p1 into t2 at l2_1.
   - Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_5.
   - Unload p1 from t2 at l2_5. (Now p1 is in l2_5, satisfying the goal for p1)

Is there any redundancy or logic error?

The flow is:
- p1 moves from l2_3 to l2_1 to l1_2 to l2_5
- p2 moves from l1_1 to l2_1 to l2_3 to l2_1 to l1_1 to l1_2

All constraints are met:
1. p2 is in a2 and p1 is in l1_2 after step 17.
2. p2 is in l2_3 after step 23.
3. p2 is in l1_2 at the end.
4. p1 is in l2_1 before p2 is in l1_2.

The goals are met:
- p1 is in l2_5 at the end.
- p2 is in l1_2 at the end.

I think this plan works well.
