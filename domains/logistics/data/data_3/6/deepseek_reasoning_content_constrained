Okay, let's try to solve this planning problem. Hmm, the goal is to get p1 to l2_5 and p2 to l1_4, with some constraints. Let's break it down.

First, the initial state: p1 is at l1_3 in c1, and p2 is at l1_4. Wait, but the goal wants p2 to stay in l1_4? So maybe p2 doesn't need to move. Wait, noâ€”the goal says p2 must be in l1_4. Since it's already there initially, maybe we don't need to do anything with p2. But wait, there's a constraint that p2 must be in a2 at some state. So even though p2's final position is the same as initial, we have to load it into a2 and then unload it back? Hmm.

Also, the constraints:

1. At some state, p1 is in l2_1. Then, if that happens, p1 must be in l2_3 at s or later.

2. p2 must be in a2 at some state.

3. At some state, either p2 is in a1 or p1 is in l2_2.

So the plan must satisfy these constraints.

For p1: It starts in l1_3 (city c1). To get to l2_5 (city c2), it needs to go via an airplane. Let's think. The airports are l1_1 (c1) and l2_1 (c2). So maybe move p1 from l1_3 to l1_1 via truck, then load into airplane a1 (which is in l1_1 initially?), wait no: the initial state says "Package a1 is in location l1_1". Wait, but a1 is an airplane, right? Wait, the objects include "airplane a1" and "airplane a2". The original state says "Package a1 is in location l1_1". Wait, that's probably a mistake. Because airplanes are not packages. Maybe that's a typo. Wait, the original state lists "Package a1 is in location l1_1". But a1 is an airplane. That must be a mistake. Maybe it's supposed to say "Airplane a1 is in location l1_1". Otherwise, the problem is impossible because we can't fly a package as an airplane.

Assuming that's a typo, and the airplanes are in their respective airports. So a1 is at l1_1 (c1's airport) and a2 is at l2_1 (c2's airport). Otherwise, if a1 is a package, this doesn't make sense. So I'll proceed under that assumption.

So, for p1: to get from l1_3 (c1) to l2_5 (c2), we need to transport it to l1_1, load into a1, fly to l2_1, then unload and transport via truck in c2 to l2_5. But also, the constraints require that p1 is in l2_1 at some state. Which would happen when it's unloaded there. Then, from there, we have to ensure that either in that state or later, p1 is in l2_3. So after arriving at l2_1, maybe we need to drive it to l2_3 first, then to l2_5. But that would add steps.

Alternatively, perhaps after unloading p1 at l2_1, we can load it into a truck, drive to l2_3, unload (satisfying the constraint that if p1 was in l2_1, then later it's in l2_3), then drive to l2_5.

Wait, but the goal is l2_5. So the path would be l1_3 -> l1_1 (via truck), load into a1, fly to l2_1, unload. Then, load into a truck in c2 (truck t2 is in l2_1 initially? Wait, the initial state says "Package t1 is in location l1_5", "Package t2 is in location l2_1". Wait, again, t1 and t2 are trucks, not packages. So that's another typo. So the original state should be "Truck t1 is in l1_5", "Truck t2 is in l2_1". Otherwise, if t1 is a package, that's incorrect. So assuming that the original state entries for trucks and airplanes are mislabeled as packages.

So initial state:

- Trucks: t1 is in l1_5 (c1), t2 is in l2_1 (c2).

- Airplanes: a1 is in l1_1 (c1), a2 is in l2_1 (c2).

So for p1's journey:

1. Move p1 from l1_3 to l1_1. How? We need a truck in c1. Truck t1 is in l1_5. So we can drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_3, then load p1 into t1, then drive to l1_1, unload, load into a1, fly to l2_1. Then unload p1 from a1. Then, use truck t2 (in l2_1) to drive to l2_3, unload p1 (so that the constraint that after being in l2_1, it reaches l2_3 is met). Then drive to l2_5 and unload.

But let's check the constraints. The first constraint is that p1 must be in l2_1 at some state. That happens when we unload it from a1. Then, the second constraint says that if p1 is in l2_1 in some state, then in that state or later, it must be in l2_3. So after unloading at l2_1, we need to get it to l2_3. So that's handled by transporting to l2_3.

Then the third constraint is that p2 must be in a2 at some state. Since p2 starts in l1_4 (c1), but the goal is to have it in l1_4 again. So we need to load it into a2. Wait, a2 is in c2's airport l2_1. But p2 is in c1. How can we get p2 into a2?

Hmm. To get p2 into a2, which is in l2_1 (c2), we need to transport p2 from l1_4 (c1) to l2_1. That would require using an airplane. But how? Let's see.

But first, the plan for p1:

Steps:

1. Drive truck t1 from l1_5 to l1_3 (c1). Because t1 is initially in l1_5.

2. Load p1 into t1 at l1_3.

3. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1 (c1).

4. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1.

5. Load p1 into airplane a1 at l1_1.

6. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.

7. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1. (This satisfies the first constraint.)

Now, after this, p1 is in l2_1. Then, we need to ensure that in the same state or later, p1 is in l2_3. So:

8. Load p1 into truck t2 (since t2 is in l2_1).

9. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_3 (c2).

10. Unload p1 at l2_3. (This meets the constraint.)

Then drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_5 and unload p1 there.

Wait, but after step 10, p1 is in l2_3. So steps 11 would be drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_5, then unload.

So steps 11: Drive t2 l2_3 to l2_5.

12: Unload p1 (but wait, p1 is in t2 only if we loaded it again. Wait, after step 9 and 10, p1 is unloaded at l2_3. So after step 10, p1 is in l2_3. Then we need to get it to l2_5. So we need to load it again into t2 at l2_3, drive to l2_5, unload.

But that adds steps. Alternatively, after step 7 (p1 in l2_1), maybe use t2 to drive directly to l2_5, but that skips l2_3. But the constraint says that after p1 is in l2_1, it must be in l2_3 at some state after. So perhaps the correct path is to first go from l2_1 to l2_3, then to l2_5.

So steps:

7. Unload p1 at l2_1 (so constraint 1 met).

8. Load p1 into t2 at l2_1.

9. Drive t2 to l2_3.

10. Unload p1 at l2_3 (so constraint 2 met).

11. Load p1 into t2 again.

12. Drive t2 to l2_5.

13. Unload p1 at l2_5.

But that's a lot of steps, but necessary.

Now, for p2. The goal is to have p2 in l1_4, which is where it starts. But the constraint requires that p2 is in a2 at some state. So we need to load p2 into a2. But a2 is in l2_1 (c2). So p2 is in c1's l1_4. How to get it into a2?

So to do that, we need to transport p2 from l1_4 (c1) to l2_1 (c2), load into a2, then unload it back. But since the goal is to have it back in l1_4, perhaps we need to take it to a2, then bring it back.

But how? Let's think. Let's plan:

For p2:

1. Move p2 from l1_4 to l1_1 (c1) via truck. But we need a truck in c1. Truck t1 is in l1_1 after step 3 (if we used t1 to bring p1 to l1_1). Wait, after step 3, t1 is at l1_1. Then step 4 unloads p1 there. So t1 is available in l1_1.

So steps for p2 could be:

After handling p1's steps up to step 7 (unloading p1 at l2_1), we can use t1 (which is in l1_1) to drive back to l1_4.

Wait, but the order of steps matters. Let's see:

But the steps for p1 and p2 can be interleaved. Let's see.

Wait, maybe we can handle p2 after p1's initial steps. Let's think.

But perhaps to minimize the number of steps, it's better to handle them in parallel.

But let's outline the steps.

First, for p1:

1. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_3.

2. Load p1 into t1.

3. Drive t1 to l1_1.

4. Unload p1.

5. Load into a1.

6. Fly a1 to l2_1.

7. Unload p1 into l2_1.

Then, for p1's movement in c2:

8. Load p1 into t2 (in l2_1).

9. Drive t2 to l2_3.

10. Unload p1 (meets constraint 2).

11. Load p1 into t2.

12. Drive to l2_5.

13. Unload p1.

Now, for p2:

Need to get p2 into a2. Since a2 is in l2_1 (c2), which is in another city. So p2 has to be transported from l1_4 (c1) to l2_1 (c2). Then loaded into a2, then perhaps unloaded and transported back.

But the goal is to have p2 in l1_4. So after loading into a2, we need to unload it somewhere and bring it back. But that would require moving it again. Alternatively, maybe after loading into a2, we unload it back into l2_1, then use another airplane to bring it back? But that's complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps after loading p2 into a2 in l2_1, we can unload it there, then fly it back to c1's airport l1_1, then use a truck to bring it back to l1_4. But that's a lot of steps.

Alternatively, maybe during the process of moving p1, we can also handle p2's movement. Let's see.

But how can we get p2 to a2? Let's outline:

To load p2 into a2 (in l2_1), both p2 and a2 must be in l2_1. But a2 is already in l2_1. So p2 needs to be transported to l2_1.

So steps for p2:

1. In c1, use truck t1 (which is in l1_1 after step 3) to drive to l1_4.

2. Load p2 into t1.

3. Drive t1 back to l1_1.

4. Unload p2 into l1_1.

5. Load p2 into a1.

6. Fly a1 to l2_1.

7. Unload p2 into l2_1.

8. Load p2 into a2 (which is in l2_1).

This satisfies the constraint that p2 is in a2 at some state.

Then, to get p2 back to l1_4:

9. Unload p2 from a2 into l2_1.

10. Load into a1 (assuming a1 is back in l2_1, but after step 6, a1 is in l2_1. Wait, step 6 was to fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1. So after that, a1 is in l2_1. Then, after step 7, p2 is in l2_1, then loaded into a2 (step 8), then unloaded (step 9). Then, to get back to c1, we need to fly a1 again. Wait, but a1 is in l2_1 after step 6. So to fly back, we can:

11. Fly a1 from l2_1 to l1_1.

12. Load p2 into a1 at l2_1 (Wait, no: after step 9, p2 is in l2_1. If we fly a1 from l2_1 to l1_1, but a1 was already in l2_1. So after step 6, a1 is in l2_1. Then, step 11: Fly a1 from l2_1 to l1_1. Then, load p2 into a1 at l2_1? No, because a1 is in l1_1. Hmm, this seems complicated.

Alternatively, after step 9, p2 is in l2_1. To bring it back to c1, we need to load it into an airplane (either a1 or a2) and fly to l1_1. But a2 is in l2_1, but can't fly to c1's airport unless there's a flight path. Wait, the flyairplane action allows flying between any airports. So a2 can fly from l2_1 to l1_1, but that's a different city. But the problem says airplanes can fly between airports regardless of city. So flyairplane ap l_from l_to, as long as l_from and l_to are airports. Wait, no: the problem states that each city has one airport. So perhaps all airports are in different cities. But the flyairplane action's precondition is just that ap is in l_from. So you can fly between any two airports, even in different cities.

So, for p2's return journey:

After step 9, p2 is in l2_1. Then, we need to get it back to c1. Let's say we load it into a2, fly a2 to l1_1, then unload. Then use truck t1 (in l1_1) to drive to l1_4 and unload.

But wait, a2 is in l2_1. So steps:

9. Unload p2 from a2 into l2_1 (after step 8: load into a2).

Wait, no. Let me correct the steps:

Earlier steps for p2:

After step 8: loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (so p2 is in a2, which is in l2_1. Then, to unload p2 from a2 into l2_1, we can do unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1. But then p2 is back in l2_1, which doesn't help. Wait, but the constraint is that p2 must be in a2 at some state. So after step 8 (loadairplane), that's satisfied. Then, perhaps we can immediately unload p2 from a2 into l2_1 (step 9), then transport it back.

But why? Because the goal requires p2 to be back in l1_4.

So:

After step 8, p2 is in a2 (satisfying constraint 3).

Then:

9. Unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (now p2 is in l2_1).

10. Load p2 into a2 again? Or maybe into a1?

Wait, but we need to get p2 back to c1. So:

10. Load p2 into a1 (which is in l2_1, since we flew a1 there in step 6 for p1).

11. Fly a1 from l2_1 back to l1_1.

12. Unload p2 from a1 into l1_1.

13. Load p2 into truck t1 (which is in l1_1 after step 3).

14. Drive t1 to l1_4.

15. Unload p2 into l1_4 (its original location, which is the goal).

But this adds a lot of steps. However, the goal requires p2 to be in l1_4, which is where it started. So unless it's moved, the goal is already satisfied. But because of the constraint that p2 must be in a2 at some point, we need to move it to a2 and then bring it back.

This seems necessary. So the steps for p2 would be interleaved with those for p1.

Now, let's check the third constraint: the state where p2 is in a2 must occur. That's step 8 (loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1).

Fourth constraint: At some state, p2 is in a1 or p1 is in l2_2. Let's see. In the steps outlined so far, p1 is moved from l2_1 to l2_3, then to l2_5. So p1 never goes to l2_2. So this constraint requires that either p2 is in a1 at some point or p1 is in l2_2. Since p1 isn't in l2_2, we must ensure p2 is in a1 at some state.

So we need to have a step where p2 is in a1. How? Maybe during its transportation back to c1. For example, when we fly p2 back from l2_1 to l1_1 using a1, we load p2 into a1. So step 10: loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1. Then fly a1 to l1_1, then unload. So when p2 is loaded into a1, that satisfies the fourth constraint (p2 in a1). So that's step 10.

So, during p2's steps:

Step 10: loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (so p2 is in a1). This satisfies the fourth constraint (since "Package p2 is in a1" is true here).

So the fourth constraint is satisfied by this step.

Now, combining all steps, considering the order.

Let's outline the entire plan, interleaving steps for p1 and p2 where possible.

First, handle moving p1:

1. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_3 (c1).

2. Loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3.

3. Drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1.

4. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1.

5. Loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1.

6. Flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1.

7. Unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1. (Constraint 1 met here.)

Then, start moving p2:

8. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1. (t1 was at l1_1 after step 3.)

9. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4.

10. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1.

11. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

12. Loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1.

But wait, a1 is in l2_1 after step 6. So step 12 can't be done. Oops, mistake here. Because after step 6, a1 is in l2_1. So step 12 would require p2 and a1 to be in the same location. But a1 is in l2_1, and p2 is in l1_1. So this is impossible.

Ah, this is a problem. Because after step 6, a1 is in l2_1. So we can't load p2 into a1 in l1_1 anymore. So our previous plan is invalid.

So we need to adjust the steps for p2.

Alternative approach: To transport p2 to l2_1 using another airplane. But initially, a2 is in l2_1. So we need to fly a2 to l1_1 to pick up p2. But a2 is in l2_1. So steps:

For p2:

1. Drive t1 from l1_1 (after step 3) to l1_4.

2. Load p2 into t1.

3. Drive t1 to l1_1.

4. Unload p2.

But then, to get p2 into a2, which is in l2_1. So we need to fly a1 back to l1_1? Or use a2.

Wait, perhaps:

After step 7 (p1 is in l2_1), we can fly a1 back to l1_1. But that would take steps.

Wait, steps for a1:

After step 6, a1 is in l2_1. So to use a1 again to transport p2 from l1_1, we need to fly a1 back to l1_1. But that would require step:

8. Flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1.

But then, after that, a1 is back in l1_1. Then, we can load p2 into a1 and fly to l2_1 again.

So for p2:

9. Fly a1 back to l1_1.

10. Load p2 into a1.

11. Fly a1 to l2_1.

But this seems possible. Let's outline:

Continuing after step 7 (p1 is unloaded at l2_1):

8. Flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1. (Now a1 is back in l1_1.)

Now, handle p2:

9. Drivetruck t1 (which is in l1_1 after step 3) from l1_1 to l1_4.

10. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4.

11. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1.

12. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

13. Loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1.

14. Flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1.

15. Unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1. (Now p2 is in l2_1.)

16. Loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1. (This satisfies constraint 3: p2 is in a2.)

17. Unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1. (Now p2 is back in l2_1.)

But now we need to get p2 back to l1_4. To do that, we can load it into a1 again (if a1 is available) and fly back.

18. Loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1. (But a1 is in l2_1 after step 14.)

19. Flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1.

20. Unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1.

21. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

22. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1.

23. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4. (Goal met.)

But this adds many steps. Also, step 18 loads p2 into a1, which would satisfy the fourth constraint (p2 in a1) during step 18.

Now, for p1's movement after step 7:

7. p1 is in l2_1.

Then, steps for p1:

24. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1.

25. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2.

26. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3. (Constraint 2 met.)

27. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3.

28. Drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2.

29. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5. (Goal met.)

Now, let's check all constraints:

- Constraint 1: p1 is in l2_1 at step 7. Met.

- Constraint 2: after step 7, p1 is in l2_3 (step 26). Met.

- Constraint 3: p2 is in a2 at step 16. Met.

- Constraint 4: p2 is in a1 at step 18. Met.

But this seems like a very long plan. However, given the constraints, this might be necessary.

But is there a way to optimize? Let's see.

Alternative approach: Maybe combine some steps.

After step 7 (p1 in l2_1), we can immediately handle p1's movement to l2_3 and then to l2_5. Then, handle p2.

But how?

Wait, the steps for p1 after step 7:

Load into t2, drive to l2_3, unload (constraint met), then load again and drive to l2_5.

But perhaps after that, we can proceed with p2's steps.

But we need to ensure that the constraints for p2 are met.

Alternatively, maybe during p2's transportation, we can satisfy some constraints.

But let's see.

Alternatively, when transporting p2 to a2, we can use a different approach. For example, instead of using a1 to bring p2 to l2_1, maybe use a2. But a2 is in l2_1 initially, so to get p2 into a2, we need to get p2 to l2_1. But a2 can't fly to c1. Wait, a2 is in l2_1 (c2), and to get p2 to l2_1, we need to fly it there. So using a1 to transport p2.

But this seems necessary.

Alternatively, could we use airplane a2 to fly to c1's airport? But airports are in cities, so l1_1 is in c1. So can a2 fly from l2_1 to l1_1?

Yes, the flyairplane action allows flying between any two airports. So perhaps:

For p2:

1. Use truck t1 to bring p2 to l1_1.

2. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.

3. Load p2 into a2 in l1_1.

4. Fly a2 back to l2_1.

5. Unload p2 into a2, satisfying the constraint.

But how does a2 get to l1_1? The initial position of a2 is l2_1. So:

Step x: Flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

But then, after this, a2 is in l1_1. Then load p2 into a2 there, fly back to l2_1.

So steps:

For p2:

8. Flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1. (Now a2 is in l1_1.)

9. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1.

10. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4.

11. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1.

12. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

13. Loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1.

14. Flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1.

15. Unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1. (Now p2 is in l2_1, and was loaded into a2 during step 13, which satisfies constraint 3.)

Then, to get p2 back:

16. Loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1. (But a1 is in l2_1 from step 6.)

17. Flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1.

18. Unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1.

19. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

20. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1.

21. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4.

This way, constraint 4 is satisfied when p2 is loaded into a1 in step 16 (no, step 16 is load into a1, which would make p2 in a1, satisfying the fourth constraint (p2 in a1).

But wait, the fourth constraint requires that at some state, p2 is in a1 OR p1 is in l2_2. Since p1 is never in l2_2, we need p2 to be in a1.

So step 16 is loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1. Then, p2 is in a1, satisfying constraint 4.

But this approach may save some steps compared to the previous plan.

Let's outline the full plan with this approach:

For p1:

1. Drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1.

2. Loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3.

3. Drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1.

4. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1.

5. Loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1.

6. Flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1.

7. Unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1. (Constraint 1 met.)

For p1 to reach goal:

8. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1.

9. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2.

10. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3. (Constraint 2 met.)

11. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3.

12. Drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2.

13. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5. (Goal met.)

For p2:

14. Flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1. (Now a2 is in l1_1.)

15. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1.

16. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4.

17. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1.

18. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

19. Loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1.

20. Flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1.

21. Unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1. (Now p2 is in l2_1.)

22. Loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1. (Satisfies constraint 4.)

23. Flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1.

24. Unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1.

25. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

26. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1.

27. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4. (Goal met.)

This plan has 27 steps. But perhaps there's a way to optimize further.

Wait, step 14: fly a2 to l1_1. Then step 20: fly a2 back to l2_1. Then step 22: load into a1. But after step 6, a1 is in l2_1, and after step 23, fly a1 back to l1_1.

But perhaps after step 6 (a1 is in l2_1), we can fly a1 back to l1_1 earlier, which might help with p2's steps.

Alternatively, let's think of merging steps.

Another approach: After step 7 (p1 unloaded at l2_1), we can immediately handle p1's movement in c2:

8. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1.

9. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2.

10. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3.

11. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3.

12. Drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2.

13. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5. (Goal met for p1.)

Then handle p2:

14. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1. (t1 is at l1_1 after step 3.)

15. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4.

16. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1.

17. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

18. Flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1. (Bring a2 to l1_1 to load p2.)

19. Loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1.

20. Flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1.

21. Unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1. (Now p2 is in l2_1, and was in a2 during step 19-20, satisfying constraint 3.)

Then, to satisfy constraint 4, we need p2 to be in a1.

22. Loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1. (a1 is in l2_1 after step 6.)

23. Flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1.

24. Unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1.

25. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

26. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1.

27. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4.

But this way, constraint 4 is met at step 22.

This approach also has 27 steps. It's not clear if it's shorter.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find a way to have p2 in a1 during transportation.

Wait, after step 18, a2 is in l1_1. After step 19, load p2 into a2, fly back to l2_1. Then unload, then load into a1 (step 22), fly back to l1_1.

But perhaps instead of flying a1 back and forth, we can use a2 again. Hmm.

Alternatively, after step 21 (p2 in l2_1), to get back to c1, we can load into a1 and fly.

But this seems necessary.

Is there a way to combine steps to minimize the total actions?

Another idea: After step 13 (p1 delivered), we can use a1 to transport p2.

But a1 is in l2_1 after step 6. After step 23, a1 is flown back to l1_1.

But perhaps steps can be reordered.

Alternatively, maybe after step 6 (a1 is in l2_1), use a1 to transport p2 back.

But let's think again.

Another approach: Since the goal requires p2 to be in l1_4, which is its initial location, and the only reason to move it is to satisfy the constraints, perhaps the minimal steps are to load p2 into a2 and then unload it back immediately.

But how can p2 get into a2? a2 is in l2_1 (c2). So p2 needs to be transported to l2_1. So steps:

1. Drive t1 (in l1_5) to l1_4, load p2, drive to l1_1, load into a1, fly to l2_1, unload p2, load into a2 (constraint 3 met), unload, load into a1, fly back to l1_1, unload, drive to l1_4.

But this seems necessary.

But in this case, after unloading p2 into a2 (l2_1), we unload it and then load into a1 to return.

But perhaps this is the minimal path.

Let's outline:

For p2:

1. Drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1. (t1 starts at l1_5.)

2. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4.

3. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1.

4. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

5. Loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1.

6. Flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1.

7. Unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1.

8. Loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1. (constraint 3 met.)

9. Unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1.

10. Loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1. (constraint 4 met.)

11. Flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1.

12. Unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1.

13. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

14. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1.

15. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4.

This is 15 steps for p2, but combined with p1's steps.

But p1's steps would be:

1. Drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1.

But wait, t1 is used for both p1 and p2. So we have to interleave the steps.

So overall plan:

For p1:

1. Drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1.

2. Loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3.

3. Drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1.

4. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1.

5. Loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1.

6. Flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1.

7. Unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1. (constraint 1 met.)

For p1's movement in c2:

8. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1.

9. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2.

10. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3. (constraint 2 met.)

11. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3.

12. Drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2.

13. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5. (goal met.)

For p2:

14. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1. (after step 3, t1 is in l1_1.)

15. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4.

16. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1.

17. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

18. Flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1. (after step 6, a1 is in l2_1.)

19. Loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1.

20. Flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1.

21. Unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1.

22. Loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1. (constraint 3 met.)

23. Unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1.

24. Loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1. (constraint 4 met.)

25. Flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1.

26. Unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1.

27. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

28. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1.

29. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4.

But this is 29 steps. It's getting quite long. Is there a way to shorten this?

Wait, step 18: fly a1 from l2_1 to l1_1. Then step 19: load p2 into a1. But after step 6, a1 is in l2_1. To load p2 into a1, we need to bring a1 back to l1_1. So step 18 is necessary.

Alternatively, maybe use a2 to transport p2. Let's see.

For p2's journey to a2:

1. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.

2. Load p2 into a2.

3. Fly back to l2_1.

But this requires:

14. Flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

15. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1.

16. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4.

17. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1.

18. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

19. Loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1.

20. Flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1.

21. Unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1. (constraint 3 met.)

Then, to get p2 back:

22. Loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1. (constraint 4 met.)

23. Flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1.

24. Unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1.

25. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

26. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1.

27. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4.

This way, steps for p2 are from 14 to 27, which is 14 steps. Combined with p1's 13 steps, total steps would be 27.

But is this better?

Overall, the minimal plan length is constrained by the required steps. Given the problem's complexity and the constraints, I think the optimal plan would have around 20-25 steps. However, given the requirement to satisfy all constraints and move both packages, it's challenging to shorten it further.

Another optimization: After step 7 (p1 is in l2_1), we can handle p2's transportation to a2 while p1 is being moved to l2_3.

For example, after step 7:

8. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1.

9. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2.

10. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3. (constraint 2 met.)

11. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3.

12. Drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2.

13. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5.

Meanwhile, handle p2:

14. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1.

15. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4.

16. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1.

17. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

18. Flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

19. Loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1.

20. Flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1.

21. Unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1. (constraint 3 met.)

22. Loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1. (constraint 4 met.)

23. Flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1.

24. Unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1.

25. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

26. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1.

27. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4.

This results in 27 steps again.

Given all these possibilities, it's clear that the constraints require several steps to be taken, and there's no way to avoid them. Therefore, the optimal plan must include all these steps.
