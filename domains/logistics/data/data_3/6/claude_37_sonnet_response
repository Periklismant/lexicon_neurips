Let's analyze this problem step by step.

First, let's understand what we're given:
- We have 2 cities (c1 and c2), each with multiple locations including an airport.
- City c1 has locations l1_1 (airport), l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, and l1_5.
- City c2 has locations l2_1 (airport), l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, and l2_5.
- We have 2 packages (p1 and p2).
- We have 2 trucks (t1 and t2).
- We have 2 airplanes (a1 and a2).

Now, let's understand the initial state:
- Location l1_1 is in city c1 (this is the airport of c1)
- Location l1_2 is in city c1
- Location l1_3 is in city c1
- Location l1_4 is in city c1
- Location l1_5 is in city c1
- Location l2_1 is in city c2 (this is the airport of c2)
- Location l2_2 is in city c2
- Location l2_3 is in city c2
- Location l2_4 is in city c2
- Location l2_5 is in city c2
- "Package t1 is in location l1_5" - Wait, this doesn't make sense. t1 is a truck, not a package.
- "Package t2 is in location l2_1" - Same issue.
- "Package p1 is in location l1_3" - p1 is initially at l1_3 in city c1.
- "Package p2 is in location l1_4" - p2 is initially at l1_4 in city c1.
- "Package a1 is in location l1_1" - a1 is an airplane, not a package. It's at the airport in city c1.
- "Package a2 is in location l2_1" - a2 is an airplane, not a package. It's at the airport in city c2.

I think there's some confusion in the initial state description. Let me reinterpret it:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_5 (in city c1)
- Truck t2 is in location l2_1 (in city c2, at the airport)
- Package p1 is in location l1_3 (in city c1)
- Package p2 is in location l1_4 (in city c1)
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (at the airport in city c1)
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1 (at the airport in city c2)

Our goal is:
- Package p1 should be in location l2_5 (in city c2)
- Package p2 should remain in location l1_4 (in city c1)

And we have these constraints:
1. Package p1 must pass through location l2_1 (the airport in city c2) at some point.
2. If p1 passes through l2_1, it must also pass through l2_3 at the same time or later.
3. Package p2 must be in a2 (an airplane) at some point.
4. At some point, either p2 must be in a1 (an airplane) or p1 must be in location l2_2.

Now, let's draft a plan:

First, let's think about p1:
1. We need to move p1 from l1_3 to l2_5.
2. It needs to pass through both l2_1 and l2_3 on the way.
3. We can use a truck to move it within a city and an airplane to move it between cities.

For package p1:
1. Use truck t1 to move p1 from l1_3 to l1_1 (the airport in city c1).
2. Load p1 onto airplane a1.
3. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1 (the airport in city c2).
4. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1 (this satisfies the first constraint).
5. Use truck t2 to move p1 from l2_1 to l2_3 (this satisfies the second constraint).
6. Then, use t2 to move p1 from l2_3 to l2_5 (our final destination for p1).

For package p2:
1. p2 is already at its destination (l1_4).
2. But we need it to be in a2 at some point.
3. So, we need to load p2 onto a truck, move it to the airport, load it onto a2, then later unload it and return it to l1_4.
4. Also, we need either p2 to be in a1 or p1 to be in l2_2.

Let's revise our plan for both packages:

For package p1:
1. Drive truck t1 from l1_5 to l1_3.
2. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_3.
3. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1 (the airport in city c1).
4. Load p1 onto airplane a1.
5. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1 (the airport in city c2).
6. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1 (this satisfies the first constraint).
7. Load p1 onto truck t2 at l2_1.
8. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2 (this satisfies the fourth constraint since p1 will be in location l2_2).
9. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_3 (this satisfies the second constraint).
10. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_5.
11. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_5.

For package p2:
1. Drive truck t1 from l1_3 (where we left it after handling p1) to l1_4.
2. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_4.
3. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1 (the airport in city c1).
4. Fly airplane a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
5. Load p2 onto a2 at l1_1 (this satisfies the third constraint).
6. Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1.
7. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_1.
8. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_4.
9. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_4.

However, this might not be the most efficient plan. Let's think if there's a more optimal approach.

Actually, for p2, we can keep it where it is (at l1_4) since that's its final destination. We just need to move it briefly to satisfy the constraint that it must be in a2 at some point.

Also, I realized that constraint 4 says "either p2 must be in a1 or p1 must be in location l2_2." Since we're already planning to move p1 through l2_2, this constraint will be satisfied. So, we don't need to worry about moving p2 to a1.

Let's provide a more streamlined plan:

For package p1:
1. Drive truck t1 from l1_5 to l1_3.
2. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_3.
3. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1 (the airport in city c1).
4. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1.
5. Load p1 onto airplane a1 at l1_1.
6. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1 (the airport in city c2).
7. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1 (this satisfies the first constraint).
8. Load p1 onto truck t2 at l2_1.
9. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2 (this satisfies the fourth constraint since p1 will be in location l2_2).
10. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_3 (this satisfies the second constraint).
11. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_5.
12. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_5.

For package p2:
1. Drive truck t1 from l1_1 (where we left it after handling p1) to l1_4.
2. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_4.
3. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1 (the airport in city c1).
4. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1.
5. Fly airplane a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
6. Load p2 onto a2 at l1_1 (this satisfies the third constraint).
7. Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1.
8. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_1.
9. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_4.
10. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_4.

However, it's a bit inefficient to have p2 go all the way to the airport and back. 

Actually, looking at the problem statement closely, all of the constraints need to be met, not just one. This means we need to:
1. Have p1 at l2_1 at some point (which we do).
2. Have p1 at l2_3 at or after it's at l2_1 (which we do).
3. Have p2 in a2 at some point.
4. Either have p2 in a1 or p1 at l2_2 at some point (which we do by having p1 at l2_2).

So, my plan seems solid. We need to move p2 to satisfy the third constraint, even though it's already at its final destination.

Let's summarize the plan:

For package p1:
1. Drive truck t1 from l1_5 to l1_3.
2. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_3.
3. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1 (the airport in city c1).
4. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1.
5. Load p1 onto airplane a1 at l1_1.
6. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1 (the airport in city c2).
7. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1.
8. Load p1 onto truck t2 at l2_1.
9. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2.
10. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_3.
11. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_5.
12. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_5.

For package p2:
1. At this point, t1 is at l1_1 and a2 is at l2_1.
2. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
3. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_4.
4. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_4.
5. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1.
6. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1.
7. Load p2 onto a2 at l1_1.
8. Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1.
9. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_1.
10. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_4.
11. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_4.

Actually, let's pause and think about this. We're trying to be optimal, so let's think if there are any redundant actions.

One optimization is that we could consider keeping p2 in its place and just satisfying the constraint that it must be in a2 at some point. But for that, we'd need to bring a2 to l1_4, which would require flying a2 from l2_1 to l1_1 and then using a truck to transport p2. So, the plan I outlined seems more efficient.

However, actually, I realized we might be able to reorder some actions to be more efficient. For instance, we could:

1. Have t1 pick up p1 from l1_3, then pick up p2 from l1_4, and drop both at the airport l1_1.
2. Put p1 in a1 and fly to l2_1.
3. Put p2 in a2 briefly at l1_1, then get it back out and use t1 to take it back to l1_4.
4. Use t2 at l2_1 to move p1 to l2_5.

Actually, let me try again with a more coherent and optimal plan:

Step 1: Drive truck t1 from l1_5 to l1_3.
Step 2: Load package p1 onto t1 at l1_3.
Step 3: Drive truck t1 from l1_3 to l1_4.
Step 4: Load package p2 onto t1 at l1_4.
Step 5: Drive truck t1 from l1_4 to l1_1 (the airport in city c1).
Step 6: Unload package p1 from t1 at l1_1.
Step 7: Unload package p2 from t1 at l1_1.
Step 8: Load package p1 onto airplane a1 at l1_1.
Step 9: Fly airplane a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
Step 10: Load package p2 onto airplane a2 at l1_1 (this satisfies the third constraint: "p2 is in a2").
Step 11: Unload package p2 from a2 at l1_1.
Step 12: Load package p2 onto t1 at l1_1.
Step 13: Drive truck t1 from l1_1 to l1_4.
Step 14: Unload package p2 from t1 at l1_4.
Step 15: Fly airplane a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
Step 16: Unload package p1 from a1 at l2_1 (this satisfies the first constraint: "p1 is in l2_1").
Step 17: Load package p1 onto truck t2 at l2_1.
Step 18: Drive truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_2 (this satisfies the fourth constraint: "p1 is in l2_2").
Step 19: Drive truck t2 from l2_2 to l2_3 (this satisfies the second constraint: "p1 is in l2_3").
Step 20: Drive truck t2 from l2_3 to l2_5.
Step 21: Unload package p1 from t2 at l2_5.

I think this plan satisfies all the constraints and achieves the goal optimally. Let's double-check:

Goal:
- Package p1 should be in location l2_5 (achieved in Step 21).
- Package p2 should be in location l1_4 (achieved in Step 14 and not moved afterward).

Constraints:
1. Package p1 must be in location l2_1 at some point (satisfied in Step 16).
2. If p1 is in l2_1, it must also be in l2_3 at or after that time (satisfied in Step 19, which is after Step 16).
3. Package p2 must be in a2 at some point (satisfied in Step 10).
4. Either p2 must be in a1 or p1 must be in location l2_2 at some point (satisfied in Step 18 where p1 is in l2_2).

Alright, this plan seems to work, but the order can perhaps be optimized.

Actually, I realize that the constraint of "Package p1 must be in location l2_3 at or after it's in l2_1" means that we can't just have p1 pass through l2_3 on its way to l2_5; we need to ensure that it goes there after it's been to l2_1. So, the plan is correct.

However, I realize that operations with a2 can be done in parallel with operations related to p1, so we could optimize further. For instance, a2 could be flown to l1_1 right at the start, and we could handle the constraint with p2 before even starting with p1. But since I'm asked for a linear plan (not a parallel one), the order I outlined should be fine.

Lastly, let's check the actions and see if there are any redundancies or inefficiencies:

1. Drive truck t1 from l1_5 to l1_3 (necessary to pick up p1).
2. Load package p1 onto t1 at l1_3 (necessary to transport p1).
3. Drive truck t1 from l1_3 to l1_4 (necessary to pick up p2).
4. Load package p2 onto t1 at l1_4 (necessary to transport p2 to satisfy the constraint).
5. Drive truck t1 from l1_4 to l1_1 (necessary to get both packages to the airport).
6. Unload package p1 from t1 at l1_1 (necessary to transfer p1 to the airplane).
7. Unload package p2 from t1 at l1_1 (necessary to transfer p2 to a2 for the constraint).
8. Load package p1 onto airplane a1 at l1_1 (necessary to transport p1 to city c2).
9. Fly airplane a2 from l2_1 to l1_1 (necessary to satisfy the constraint that p2 must be in a2).
10. Load package p2 onto airplane a2 at l1_1 (necessary to satisfy the constraint that p2 must be in a2).
11. Unload package p2 from a2 at l1_1 (necessary to get p2 back to its destination).
12. Load package p2 onto t1 at l1_1 (necessary to transport p2 back to its destination).
13. Drive truck t1 from l1_1 to l1_4 (necessary to return p2 to its destination).
14. Unload package p2 from t1 at l1_4 (necessary to place p2 at its destination).
15. Fly airplane a1 from l1_1 to l2_1 (necessary to transport p1 to city c2).
16. Unload package p1 from a1 at l2_1 (necessary to transfer p1 to t2 and satisfy the constraint).
17. Load package p1 onto truck t2 at l2_1 (necessary to transport p1 to its destination).
18. Drive truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_2 (necessary to satisfy the constraint and move p1 towards its destination).
19. Drive truck t2 from l2_2 to l2_3 (necessary to satisfy the constraint and move p1 towards its destination).
20. Drive truck t2 from l2_3 to l2_5 (necessary to get p1 to its destination).
21. Unload package p1 from t2 at l2_5 (necessary to place p1 at its destination).

Actually, I found a place for optimization: I could bring a2 to l1_1 after p1 is unloaded but before loading p1 onto a1 (swapping actions 8 and 9). This would ensure that there's enough space at the airport for both airplanes.

Alright, my final plan is:

Step 1: Drive truck t1 from l1_5 to l1_3.
Step 2: Load package p1 onto t1 at l1_3.
Step 3: Drive truck t1 from l1_3 to l1_4.
Step 4: Load package p2 onto t1 at l1_4.
Step 5: Drive truck t1 from l1_4 to l1_1.
Step 6: Unload package p1 from t1 at l1_1.
Step 7: Unload package p2 from t1 at l1_1.
Step 8: Fly airplane a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
Step 9: Load package p2 onto airplane a2 at l1_1.
Step 10: Unload package p2 from a2 at l1_1.
Step 11: Load package p2 onto t1 at l1_1.
Step 12: Drive truck t1 from l1_1 to l1_4.
Step 13: Unload package p2 from t1 at l1_4.
Step 14: Load package p1 onto airplane a1 at l1_1.
Step 15: Fly airplane a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
Step 16: Unload package p1 from a1 at l2_1.
Step 17: Load package p1 onto truck t2 at l2_1.
Step 18: Drive truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_2.
Step 19: Drive truck t2 from l2_2 to l2_3.
Step 20: Drive truck t2 from l2_3 to l2_5.
Step 21: Unload package p1 from t2 at l2_5.

Hmm, actually, is this the optimal plan? Let me try to think of other approaches:

I realize I'm moving p2 from its initial location (l1_4) only to satisfy the constraint that it must be in a2 at some point. But after that, I'm returning it to its original location.

I'm also following a straight path for p1: from its initial location (l1_3) to the airport (l1_1), then flying to the airport in city c2 (l2_1), and finally using a truck to go to its destination (l2_5).

Given these observations, I believe my plan is quite efficient. The main constraint I'm satisfying with p2 is that it must be in a2 at some point, so I'm moving it just enough to meet that.

Alright, let me express the plan using the provided action formats:

```
drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
```

Actually, one more thing. Checking the actions, I see that "loadairplane" and "loadairplane" have the same description. I believe one of them should be "unloadairplane". Let me assume that's the case and fix my plan:

```
drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
```

I forgot to mark the actions with "unloadairplane", but I believe it should be similar to "unloadtruck" but for airplanes.

And actually, looking at your original action descriptions, both "loadairplane" and "loadairplane" are listed, but I believe one should be "unloadairplane". Looking at the effects, one of them says "After unloading a package p from an airplane ap...", so that should be "unloadairplane".

Here's the plan with corrected action names:

```
drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
```

Actually wait, I just noticed something fishy in the original problem description. Based on the wording and instructions, it should be:

- Location l1_1 is in city c1 (this is the airport of c1)
- Location l1_2 is in city c1
- Location l1_3 is in city c1
- Location l1_4 is in city c1
- Location l1_5 is in city c1
- Location l2_1 is in city c2 (this is the airport of c2)
- Location l2_2 is in city c2
- Location l2_3 is in city c2
- Location l2_4 is in city c2
- Location l2_5 is in city c2
- Truck t1 is in location l1_5
- Truck t2 is in location l2_1
- Package p1 is in location l1_3
- Package p2 is in location l1_4
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

That makes much more sense than what is written in the problem statement. Let me base my solution on this interpretation, which aligns with the plan I've already devised.

But now looking back, I think one of the constraints is a bit vague to me: "package p1 must be in location l2_3 at or after it's in l2_1". Given the plan I've laid out, I have p1:
- First at l2_1 (Step 16)
- Then at l2_2 (Step 18)
- Then at l2_3 (Step 19)
- Finally at l2_5 (Step 21)

So, p1 is at l2_3 after it's at l2_1, which satisfies this constraint. The constraint is ensuring a certain ordering or path for p1, and my plan respects that.

So yes, I believe the plan I've outlined is optimal and valid.

Actually, the action definitions in the problem statement have a typo: "loadairplane" is repeated, and one of them should be "unloadairplane". Based on the effects described, I've interpreted the action names correctly in my plan.

```
drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
```

This plan should satisfy all the constraints and achieve the goal optimally.
