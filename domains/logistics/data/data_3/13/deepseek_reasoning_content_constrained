Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. The goal is to get package p1 to location l2_1, but there are several constraints we need to satisfy along the way. Let me start by understanding the initial state and the requirements.

First, the initial state. Package p1 is in location l2_4, which is in city c2. The goal is to have it in l2_1, which is an airport in c2. The constraints are:

1. p1 must be in t2 at least once.
2. If p1 is in t2 in some state, then p1 must be in t1 either in that state or a later one.
3. p1 must be in l2_7 at some point.
4. p1 must be in l1_10 at some point.

So, the plan needs to move p1 through these locations and trucks while ensuring the constraints are met. Let's outline possible steps.

Starting in l2_4 (c2). To get to l2_1, which is an airport. Since airplanes can fly between airports, maybe we can use an airplane. But p1 is in c2. Let's check the available trucks and airplanes.

Looking at the objects:

- Trucks t1 (in l1_6) and t2 (in l2_8, based on the original state: "Package t1 is in location l1_6", "Package t2 is in location l2_8" â€” wait, wait, wait. Wait, the original state mentions "Package t1 is in location l1_6". Wait, but t1 is a truck, right? Oh, that's a mistake. Let me check again.

Wait, the objects are listed as:

"truck t1"
"truck t2"
"airplane a1"
"airplane a2"

But in the original state, it says:

"Package t1 is in location l1_6"
"Package t2 is in location l2_8"
"Package p1 is in location l2_4"
"Package a1 is in location l1_1"
"Package a2 is in location l2_1"

Wait, that can't be right. The original state seems to have a mistake. Because t1 and t2 are trucks, not packages. Similarly, a1 and a2 are airplanes, not packages. So perhaps there's a typo here. Let me read that again carefully.

Original state:

"Package t1 is in location l1_6"
"Package t2 is in location l2_8"
"Package p1 is in location l2_4"
"Package a1 is in location l1_1"
"Package a2 is in location l2_1"

Wait, this must be incorrect. Because the objects list includes "truck t1", "truck t2", "airplane a1", "airplane a2", so they shouldn't be listed as packages. This is probably a transcription error in the problem statement. Let me assume that it's a typo, and that these are the locations of the trucks and airplanes. So, the correct initial state should be:

- Truck t1 is in location l1_6
- Truck t2 is in location l2_8
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (which is an airport in c1)
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1 (airport in c2)
- Package p1 is in l2_4

Because otherwise, if t1 and t2 are packages, that contradicts the objects list. So, I'll proceed under the assumption that the original state entries for t1, t2, a1, a2 are actually the locations of the trucks and airplanes, not packages. So the correct initial state is:

- Truck t1 is at l1_6 (c1)
- Truck t2 is at l2_8 (c2)
- Airplane a1 is at l1_1 (c1 airport)
- Airplane a2 is at l2_1 (c2 airport)
- Package p1 is at l2_4 (c2)

Now, the goal is to have p1 in l2_1 (c2's airport). Let's think about the possible steps.

First, since p1 starts in c2, and needs to get to l2_1. But there's a constraint that p1 must be in l1_10 (which is in c1) and l2_7 (c2). So we need to move p1 from c2 to c1 and back? Because l1_10 is in c1. So the plan must involve moving p1 to c1 at some point, then back to c2, then to l2_1.

But how to do that? Let's see. Since airplanes can move between airports. So maybe:

1. Use truck t2 (in l2_8) to pick up p1 from l2_4.

Wait, p1 is in l2_4 (c2). Truck t2 is in l2_8 (c2). So first, drive t2 from l2_8 to l2_4. Then load p1 into t2. Then drive to l2_7 (which is a location in c2). Unload p1 there (satisfying constraint 3). Then, perhaps move p1 to another truck or airplane.

But to get p1 to l1_10 (c1), we need to move it from c2 to c1. That requires an airplane. So, perhaps:

- Load p1 into a truck in c2, drive to the airport l2_1 (but wait, l2_1 is the airport in c2 where airplane a2 is). So load p1 into a2, fly to l1_1 (c1's airport), then unload into a truck there (t1 is in l1_6). But first, t1 would need to go to l1_1 to load the package. Then drive to l1_10, unload p1 there (satisfying constraint 4), then back to the airport, load onto airplane, fly back to c2, then deliver to l2_1.

But this seems complicated. Let's outline step by step.

First, in c2:

1. Drive truck t2 from l2_8 to l2_4. Then load p1 into t2. This satisfies the first constraint (p1 in t2). But then, according to constraint 2, if p1 is in t2, then p1 must be in t1 either at the same time or later. Since t1 is in c1, how can p1 get into t1? We need to transport p1 to c1 first.

So after loading p1 into t2, maybe drive t2 to l2_7 (to satisfy constraint 3). Then unload p1 there. Then, perhaps load p1 into another truck (but in c2, there's only t2?), wait, the problem lists two trucks: t1 in c1 (l1_6) and t2 in c2 (l2_8). So in c2, only t2 is available. So to get p1 into t1 (which is in c1), we need to move p1 to c1.

So after getting p1 into t2 (at l2_4), drive t2 to l2_7 (unload there), then maybe drive to l2_1 (the airport), load p1 into airplane a2 (which is at l2_1). Fly a2 to l1_1 (c1's airport). Then in c1, use truck t1 to move p1 from l1_1 to l1_10, then back to the airport, load into airplane a1, fly back to l2_1. But that might be overcomplicating.

Wait, let's break it down:

Constraints:

- p1 must be in t2 at least once. So first step: load p1 into t2.

Then, per constraint 2: after that, p1 must be in t1 at some point. So after being in t2, p1 must eventually be loaded into t1. But t1 is in c1. So p1 needs to be moved to c1 and loaded into t1.

So steps:

1. Drive t2 from l2_8 to l2_4. (drivetruck t2 l2_8 l2_4 c2)
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4. (now p1 is in t2, satisfying first constraint)
3. Drive t2 to l2_7. (drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_7 c2)
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_7. (now p1 is in l2_7, satisfying constraint 3)
5. Then, to move p1 to c1, we need to get it to an airport in c2 (l2_1), load into a2, fly to l1_1.

But p1 is in l2_7. So steps:

6. Drive t2 from l2_7 to l2_1. (drivetruck t2 l2_7 l2_1 c2)
7. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1. (but wait, a2 is at l2_1, right? Yes. So load p1 into a2.
8. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1. Now a2 is at l1_1 (c1's airport)
9. Now, in c1, truck t1 is at l1_6. So need to move t1 to l1_1 to load the package.

10. drivetruck t1 l1_6 l1_1 c1
11. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1. (Now p1 is in t1, satisfying constraint 2)
12. Drive t1 to l1_10. (drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_10 c1)
13. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_10. (satisfies constraint 4)
14. Now, p1 is in l1_10. We need to get it back to l2_1. So load it into t1 again, drive to l1_1, load into airplane a1 (which is at l1_1), fly to l2_1.

Wait, a1 is initially at l1_1. So steps:

15. drivetruck t1 l1_10 l1_1 c1 (if t1 is at l1_10)
16. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_10 (Wait, no, after step 13, p1 is in l1_10. To load it into t1, t1 needs to be there. So step 14: drive t1 from l1_10 to l1_10? No. Wait, after step 13, t1 is at l1_10. Because step 12: drive t1 to l1_10, so after unloading, t1 is still there. So p1 is in l1_10. To load it back into t1, since t1 is already there, just load it.

Wait, after step 13, t1 is at l1_10. p1 is unloaded there. So step 14: loadtruck p1 t1 l1_10. Then drive t1 back to l1_1 (airport):

15. drivetruck t1 l1_10 l1_1 c1
16. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (now p1 is at l1_1)
17. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (a1 is there)
18. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
19. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 (now p1 is at l2_1, goal achieved)

But wait, after step 18, a1 is at l2_1. So unloading there would place p1 in l2_1, which is the goal.

But let's check the steps:

Constraints check:

- p1 is in t2 (step 2: yes)
- Then, p1 is in t1 (step 11: yes)
- p1 is in l2_7 (step 4: yes)
- p1 is in l1_10 (step 13: yes)

All constraints are satisfied.

Now let's count the steps:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_8 l2_4 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
3. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_7 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_7
5. drivetruck t2 l2_7 l2_1 c2
6. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
7. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
8. drivetruck t1 l1_6 l1_1 c1
9. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
10. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_10 c1
11. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_10
12. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_10
13. drivetruck t1 l1_10 l1_1 c1
14. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
15. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
16. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
17. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

Wait, that's 17 steps. But maybe there's a shorter path. Let's see if we can optimize.

Alternative approach: After step 4, p1 is in l2_7. Then, instead of driving t2 to l2_1, perhaps use another truck? But in c2, only t2 is available. So yes, step 5 is necessary.

But when moving p1 from l2_7 to l2_1 via t2, then load into a2 and fly to l1_1. Then, in c1, t1 is at l1_6. So steps 8-11 are moving t1 to l1_1, load p1, drive to l1_10, unload. Then steps 12-17 to get it back.

Wait, perhaps after step 11 (unloading in l1_10), we can directly fly from l1_10 to l2_1? But airplanes can only be at airports. So l1_10 is not an airport. So p1 has to be moved to an airport in c1 (l1_1) to fly back.

So the steps are necessary.

Alternatively, after step 13 (unload in l1_10), can we load into t1, drive to l1_1, then load into a1 and fly to l2_1. So steps 12: load into t1 (l1_10), drive to l1_1, unload, load into a1, fly, unload.

Yes, that's steps 12-17 as before.

But maybe there's a way to avoid some steps. For example, after flying to l1_1, instead of unloading p1 and then loading into t1, perhaps the airplane can carry it directly to another location? No, because airplanes can only go between airports. So to get p1 to l1_10, a truck is needed.

Alternatively, can we avoid unloading p1 at l1_10 and then reloading? Wait, the constraint requires that p1 is in l1_10 at least once. So we have to unload it there. So that step is necessary.

Hmm. Let me check again the steps:

1. Drive t2 to l2_4
2. Load p1 into t2 (constraint 1 met)
3. Drive to l2_7, unload (constraint 3 met)
4. Drive to l2_1, load into a2
5. Fly to l1_1
6. Drive t1 to l1_1
7. Load into t1 (constraint 2 met)
8. Drive to l1_10, unload (constraint 4 met)
9. Load back into t1, drive to l1_1, unload
10. Load into a1, fly to l2_1, unload (goal)

This is 10 steps. Wait, maybe my initial count was wrong. Let's recount:

Original steps:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_8 l2_4 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
3. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_7 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_7
5. drivetruck t2 l2_7 l2_1 c2
6. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
7. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
8. drivetruck t1 l1_6 l1_1 c1
9. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
10. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_10 c1
11. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_10
12. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_10
13. drivetruck t1 l1_10 l1_1 c1
14. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
15. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
16. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
17. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

But steps 12-14 could be optimized. After unloading p1 at l1_10 (step 11), to get it to the airport, we can load it into t1 again (since t1 is already at l1_10) and drive back to l1_1. So steps 12: loadtruck, 13: drive, 14: unload. Then load into airplane.

Alternatively, maybe after step 11, p1 is at l1_10. Then, we can drive t1 to l1_10 (but t1 is already there). Wait, after step 10, t1 is at l1_10, then step 11 unloads p1 there. So t1 remains at l1_10. So to load p1 back into t1, we just do loadtruck p1 t1 l1_10 (step 12), then drive to l1_1 (step 13), unload (step14). So those steps are necessary.

Is there a shorter way? Let's think: After unloading at l1_10 (step 11), we need to get p1 to l1_1. So steps 12-14 are necessary.

Alternatively, can we use a different airplane? For example, when p1 is in l1_10, is there another way to transport it? No, because airplanes can only be at airports. So the only way is to use t1 to move it to the airport.

Thus, this seems to be the minimal steps.

But maybe there's a way to avoid flying back. Wait, the goal is to have p1 in l2_1. So after flying to l1_1, then moving to l1_10, then flying back via a1. But a1 is initially at l1_1. So after step 7, a2 is at l1_1. Then, when we fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1, that's possible.

Wait, but a1 is initially at l1_1. So in step 15, we load p1 into a1 at l1_1, then fly to l2_1. Yes.

But perhaps after step 7, a2 is at l1_1. So maybe use a2 to fly back? But a2 is from c2's airport. But airplanes can fly between any airports. So a2 can fly back to l2_1. But p1 is in c1, so after loading into a2 at l1_1, fly back to l2_1. So steps could be:

After step 7 (a2 at l1_1), load p1 into a2 again, fly back. But wait, p1 is in l1_1 after being unloaded from a2. Wait, no: step 6 is load into a2 at l2_1, then fly to l1_1. So after flying, a2 is at l1_1, and p1 is in a2. Then unload a2 at l1_1 (step not included yet). Wait, no. Let's clarify:

Step 6: loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (p1 is now in a2)
Step7: flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (a2 is now at l1_1, p1 is still in a2)
So to unload p1 from a2 at l1_1, we need to do unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1.

Then, after that, p1 is in l1_1, and can be loaded into t1.

So maybe the steps are:

1. Drive t2 to l2_4
2. Load p1 into t2
3. Drive to l2_7, unload
4. Drive t2 to l2_1, load into a2
5. Fly a2 to l1_1
6. Unload a2 at l1_1 (now p1 is in l1_1)
7. Drive t1 to l1_1
8. Load into t1
9. Drive to l1_10, unload (constraint 4 met)
10. Load back into t1, drive to l1_1, unload
11. Load into a1 (which is already at l1_1)
12. Fly to l2_1, unload.

This would save steps? Let's see:

Original steps after step7 (fly a2 to l1_1):

But in this case, p1 is still in a2. So step 6 would need to unload it. So:

6. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

Then step7: drive t1 to l1_1 (already there?), no, t1 is at l1_6 initially. So drive t1 from l1_6 to l1_1.

So steps:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_8 l2_4 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
3. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_7 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_7
5. drivetruck t2 l2_7 l2_1 c2
6. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
7. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
8. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
9. drivetruck t1 l1_6 l1_1 c1
10. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
11. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_10 c1
12. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_10
13. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_10
14. drivetruck t1 l1_10 l1_1 c1
15. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
16. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
17. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
18. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

This adds an extra step (unloading a2 at l1_1), making it 18 steps. Which is longer. So perhaps the initial approach was better, where after flying a2 to l1_1, p1 is still in a2. Then, instead of unloading, maybe directly load into t1 from a2? No, because to load into t1, p1 must be in the same location as t1. So if a2 is at l1_1 (airport), and t1 is at l1_6, we need to drive t1 to l1_1 first.

So the initial approach where after flying a2 to l1_1, p1 is still in a2. Then, drive t1 to l1_1, and then unload a2 into t1. Wait, but you can't unload from a2 into t1 unless t1 is at the same location. So perhaps:

After step7 (fly a2 to l1_1), a2 is at l1_1 with p1 inside. Then, drive t1 to l1_1 (step8). Then, unload p1 from a2 into l1_1 (step9), then load into t1 (step10). But that adds steps.

Alternatively, maybe unload a2 into l1_1, then load into t1. But that requires two steps: unload and load.

But in the initial plan, when we load p1 into a2 at l2_1 (step6), fly to l1_1 (step7), then unload a2 (step8). Then load into t1 (step9), etc. That seems necessary.

Alternatively, maybe after flying a2 to l1_1, we can unload p1 directly into t1 if t1 is there. But t1 starts at l1_6, so we have to drive it to l1_1 first.

So regardless, the steps seem necessary.

I think the initial plan is the most optimal. Let's check again the steps:

1. Drive t2 from l2_8 to l2_4
2. Load p1 into t2
3. Drive t2 to l2_7, unload (now in l2_7)
4. Drive t2 to l2_1
5. Load p1 into a2
6. Fly a2 to l1_1
7. Drive t1 from l1_6 to l1_1
8. Load p1 into t1 (now in t1)
9. Drive t1 to l1_10, unload (now in l1_10)
10. Load p1 back into t1
11. Drive t1 to l1_1
12. Unload p1
13. Load into a1
14. Fly a1 to l2_1
15. Unload p1

This is 15 steps. But let's count correctly:

Each action is a separate step.

Let me list the correct sequence with all actions:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_8 l2_4 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
3. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_7 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_7
5. drivetruck t2 l2_7 l2_1 c2
6. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
7. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
8. drivetruck t1 l1_6 l1_1 c1
9. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
10. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_10 c1
11. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_10
12. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_10
13. drivetruck t1 l1_10 l1_1 c1
14. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
15. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
16. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
17. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

Yes, 17 steps. But perhaps there's a shorter way. Let's think:

After step 11 (p1 in l1_10), can we use a different airplane? Like, fly a1 to l1_10? No, because airplanes can only be at airports. So l1_10 is not an airport. So a1 can't go there.

Alternatively, after step 11, p1 is in l1_10. We need to get it to l2_1. So steps 12-17 are necessary.

Is there a way to avoid some steps? For example, when unloading p1 at l1_10 (step 11), if we could directly fly from l1_10, but since it's not an airport, no. So we must drive back to l1_1.

Another idea: When flying p1 to l1_1 via a2, maybe use a different airplane to take it back. But a2 is at l1_1 after step7. So we can use a2 to fly back to l2_1. So instead of using a1, use a2.

So steps after step7:

8. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (now p1 is in l1_1)
9. drivetruck t1 l1_6 l1_1 c1
10. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
11. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_10 c1
12. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_10
13. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_10
14. drivetruck t1 l1_10 l1_1 c1
15. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
16. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (since a2 is at l1_1)
17. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
18. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

This is 18 steps, which is longer. So original plan is better.

Alternatively, after step7 (a2 at l1_1 with p1 inside), instead of unloading, can we transfer p1 directly to a1? No, because a1 is at l1_1 already. Wait, a1 is at l1_1 from the start. So after step7, a2 is at l1_1. So p1 is in a2. To load into a1, we'd need to unload from a2 to l1_1, then load into a1. But that adds steps.

Alternatively, after step7, unload a2 into l1_1 (step8), load into a1 (step9), fly to l2_1 (step10), unload. Then steps:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_8 l2_4 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
3. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_7 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_7
5. drivetruck t2 l2_7 l2_1 c2
6. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
7. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
8. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
9. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
10. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
11. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

But this skips the constraints for p1 being in t1 and in l1_10. So this approach wouldn't satisfy all constraints. Because we need p1 to be in t1 and in l1_10.

Thus, this approach won't work.

Therefore, the original plan is necessary to meet all constraints.

So the final answer is the 17-step plan I outlined earlier. But maybe there's a way to shorten it. Let's check for any redundant steps.

After step 9: p1 is loaded into t1 at l1_1. Then, step10: drive to l1_10 and unload (step11). Then step12: load back into t1 (same location), drive back to l1_1 (step13), unload (step14), then load into a1 (step15), fly (step16), unload (step17).

Alternatively, after step11 (p1 in l1_10), can we directly fly from l1_10 to l2_1? No, because only airports are allowed. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, after step11, could we use another truck? But in c1, only t1 is available.

So steps 12-14 are necessary to get p1 back to the airport.

So I think this is the optimal plan. Now, let's write it in the required format.
