Let me analyze this problem carefully:

1. We have two cities (c1 and c2), each with multiple locations (l1_1 to l1_5 in c1, and l2_1 to l2_5 in c2).
2. We have two packages (p1 and p2), two trucks (t1 and t2), and two airplanes (a1 and a2).
3. The airports are l1_1 in city c1 and l2_1 in city c2.

Initial state:
- Package p1 is in location l1_4 (city c1)
- Package p2 is in location l1_4 (city c1)
- Truck t1 is in location l1_3 (city c1)
- Truck t2 is in location l2_3 (city c2)
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (airport in city c1)
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1 (airport in city c2)

Goal:
- Package p1 should be in location l2_4 (city c2)
- Package p2 should be in location l2_2 (city c2)

Constraints:
1. At some point, p1 must be in location l1_5 (city c1)
2. At some point, both p1 and p2 must be in location l2_3 (city c2)
3. At some point, p2 must be in location l1_4 (city c1) - which is already satisfied in the initial state
4. If p2 is in location l1_4 (which it is initially), then at some later point, either p2 must be in location l1_2 (city c1) or p1 must be in location l2_5 (city c2)

Let's think through a plan:

Starting with the initial state:
- p1 is in l1_4, p2 is in l1_4, t1 is in l1_3, t2 is in l2_3, a1 is in l1_1, a2 is in l2_1

For constraint 1, p1 needs to be in l1_5 at some point. So we need to move p1 from l1_4 to l1_5.
For constraint 2, both p1 and p2 need to be in l2_3 at some point. So eventually we need to move both packages to l2_3.
For constraint 3, p2 needs to be in l1_4, which is already satisfied in the initial state.
For constraint 4, since p2 is in l1_4 initially, we need to ensure that either p2 goes to l1_2 or p1 goes to l2_5 at some point.

Let's sketch a plan:

1. First, let's bring truck t1 to l1_4 to pick up both packages:
   - drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1

2. Load both packages onto t1:
   - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

3. To satisfy constraint 1, drive t1 to l1_5 and unload p1:
   - drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1
   - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5

4. Now let's decide how to satisfy constraint 4. We can either move p2 to l1_2 or move p1 to l2_5. Since p1 eventually needs to be in l2_4, let's plan for p1 to visit l2_5 on its way.

5. Load p1 back onto t1:
   - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5

6. Drive t1 to the airport (l1_1) to transfer packages to an airplane:
   - drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
   - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
   - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

7. Load both packages onto airplane a1:
   - loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
   - loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

8. Fly a1 to the airport in city c2:
   - flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

9. Unload both packages at l2_1:
   - unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
   - unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

10. Bring truck t2 to l2_1 to pick up both packages:
    - drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
    - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
    - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

11. To satisfy constraint 2, drive t2 to l2_3 with both packages:
    - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
    - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (now both p1 and p2 are in l2_3, satisfying constraint 2)
    - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (we need to continue moving p1)

12. To satisfy constraint 4 (and also move towards the goal), drive t2 to l2_5:
    - drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2
    - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (p1 is now in l2_5, satisfying part of constraint 4)
    - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (we need to continue moving p1 to its goal)

13. Drive t2 to l2_4 to drop off p1 at its goal location:
    - drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2
    - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (p1 is now at its goal)

14. Drive t2 to l2_2 to drop off p2 at its goal location:
    - drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2
    - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (p2 is now at its goal)

Let's double-check this plan:

Constraint 1: p1 is in l1_5 after step 3.
Constraint 2: Both p1 and p2 are in l2_3 after step 11.
Constraint 3: p2 is in l1_4 initially.
Constraint 4: Since p2 is in l1_4 initially, at some point either p2 should be in l1_2 or p1 should be in l2_5. In our plan, p1 is in l2_5 after step 12.

Goal conditions:
- p1 is in l2_4 after step 13.
- p2 is in l2_2 after step 14.

The plan seems to meet all constraints and achieve the goal.

Let me review the plan once more and see if there are optimizations:

Wait, I think there might be an issue. I need to clarify some confusion in the problem statement. The problem mentions:

```
"Package t1 is in location l1_3"
"Package t2 is in location l2_3"
```

But t1 and t2 are trucks, not packages. Let me re-read the initial state more carefully.

I see the issue now. The initial state says:

```
"Package t1 is in location l1_3"
"Package t2 is in location l2_3"
"Package p1 is in location l1_4"
"Package p2 is in location l1_4"
"Package a1 is in location l1_1"
"Package a2 is in location l2_1"
```

This is confusing because t1, t2, a1, a2 are not packages. Let me assume the correct interpretation is:

- Package p1 is in location l1_4
- Package p2 is in location l1_4
- Truck t1 is in location l1_3
- Truck t2 is in location l2_3
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

With this interpretation, my plan above seems valid. Let me carefully define the exact plan:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1 (Move truck t1 to pick up packages)
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4 (Load package p1 onto truck t1)
3. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (Load package p2 onto truck t1)
4. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1 (Move to satisfy constraint 1)
5. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 (Unload p1 in l1_5 to satisfy constraint 1)
6. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 (Load p1 back for transportation)
7. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1 (Move to airport for air transport)
8. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (Unload p1 for loading onto airplane)
9. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (Unload p2 for loading onto airplane)
10. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (Load p1 onto airplane)
11. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (Load p2 onto airplane)
12. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (Fly to city c2)
13. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 (Unload p1 in c2)
14. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (Unload p2 in c2)
15. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2 (Bring truck to airport)
16. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (Load p1 onto truck)
17. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (Load p2 onto truck)
18. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2 (Drive to l2_3 for constraint 2)
19. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (Unload p1 in l2_3)
20. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (Unload p2 in l2_3, now both are in l2_3 for constraint 2)
21. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (Load p1 for continuing its journey)
22. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (Load p2 for continuing its journey)
23. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2 (Drive to l2_5 for constraint 4)
24. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (Unload p1 in l2_5 to satisfy part of constraint 4)
25. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (Load p1 back for completing its journey)
26. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2 (Drive to l2_4 for p1's goal)
27. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (Unload p1 at its goal location)
28. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2 (Drive to l2_2 for p2's goal)
29. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (Unload p2 at its goal location)

So the final plan is 29 actions.

Actually, I can optimize this plan. Let's revisit:

Constraint 4 states that if p2 is in l1_4 (which it is initially), then at some later point, either p2 must be in l1_2 or p1 must be in l2_5. Both options are valid, and I've chosen to move p1 to l2_5. However, moving p2 to l1_2 might be more efficient.

Let's create an alternative plan where we move p2 to l1_2 instead:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1 (Move truck t1 to pick up packages)
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4 (Load package p1 onto truck t1)
3. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (Load package p2 onto truck t1)
4. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1 (Move to satisfy constraint 1)
5. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 (Unload p1 in l1_5 to satisfy constraint 1)
6. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 (Load p1 back for transportation)
7. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_2 c1 (Move to l1_2 for constraint 4)
8. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (Unload p2 in l1_2 to satisfy constraint 4)
9. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (Load p2 back for transportation)
10. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 (Move to airport for air transport)
11. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (Unload p1 for loading onto airplane)
12. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (Unload p2 for loading onto airplane)
13. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (Load p1 onto airplane)
14. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (Load p2 onto airplane)
15. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (Fly to city c2)
16. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 (Unload p1 in c2)
17. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (Unload p2 in c2)
18. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2 (Bring truck to airport)
19. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (Load p1 onto truck)
20. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (Load p2 onto truck)
21. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2 (Drive to l2_3 for constraint 2)
22. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (Unload p1 in l2_3)
23. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (Unload p2 in l2_3, now both are in l2_3 for constraint 2)
24. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (Load p1 for continuing its journey)
25. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (Load p2 for continuing its journey)
26. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2 (Drive to l2_4 for p1's goal)
27. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (Unload p1 at its goal location)
28. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2 (Drive to l2_2 for p2's goal)
29. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (Unload p2 at its goal location)

This alternative plan is also 29 actions, but it doesn't have the detour to l2_5. So it seems like there's no advantage to either plan.

But actually, I can optimize further. Let me check: Does the constraint say both p1 and p2 need to be in l2_3 simultaneously, or just that they both need to visit l2_3 at some point?

The constraint states: "The following conditions are all true: 'Package p2 is in location l2_3', 'Package p1 is in location l2_3'"

This seems to indicate that both packages need to be in l2_3 simultaneously. So I need to ensure they're both there at the same time, which my plans above do.

However, looking at constraints again:

Constraint 4 states: "If expression 'Package p2 is in location l1_4' holds in some state s, then expression 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "Package p2 is in location l1_2", "Package p1 is in location l2_5"' must hold at s or at some state after s."

Since p2 is in l1_4 initially, I need to ensure that either p2 visits l1_2 or p1 visits l2_5 at some point. 

I think there's still room for optimization. Let's revisit the problem:

Looking at my current plan, moving p1 from l2_3 to l2_4 (its goal) directly might be more efficient than going via l2_5. If we want to move p1 to l2_5, we'd need extra actions, so it might be better to satisfy constraint 4 by moving p2 to l1_2 instead.

So, the plan would be:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1 (Move truck t1 to pick up packages)
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4 (Load package p1 onto truck t1)
3. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (Load package p2 onto truck t1)
4. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1 (Move to satisfy constraint 1)
5. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 (Unload p1 in l1_5 to satisfy constraint 1)
6. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 (Load p1 back for transportation)
7. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_2 c1 (Move to l1_2 for constraint 4)
8. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (Unload p2 in l1_2 to satisfy constraint 4)
9. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (Load p2 back for transportation)
10. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 (Move to airport for air transport)
11. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (Unload p1 for loading onto airplane)
12. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (Unload p2 for loading onto airplane)
13. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (Load p1 onto airplane)
14. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (Load p2 onto airplane)
15. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (Fly to city c2)
16. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 (Unload p1 in c2)
17. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (Unload p2 in c2)
18. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2 (Bring truck to airport)
19. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (Load p1 onto truck)
20. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (Load p2 onto truck)
21. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2 (Drive to l2_3 for constraint 2)
22. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (Unload p1 in l2_3)
23. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (Unload p2 in l2_3, now both are in l2_3 for constraint 2)
24. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (Load p1 for continuing its journey)
25. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (Load p2 for continuing its journey)
26. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2 (Drive to l2_4 for p1's goal)
27. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (Unload p1 at its goal location)
28. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2 (Drive to l2_2 for p2's goal)
29. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (Unload p2 at its goal location)

This plan is 29 actions long. Let's check if it satisfies all constraints:

Constraint 1: p1 is in l1_5 after step 5. ✓
Constraint 2: Both p1 and p2 are in l2_3 after step 23. ✓
Constraint 3: p2 is in l1_4 initially. ✓
Constraint 4: Since p2 is in l1_4 initially, at some point either p2 should be in l1_2 or p1 should be in l2_5. In our plan, p2 is in l1_2 after step 8. ✓

Goal conditions:
- p1 is in l2_4 after step 27. ✓
- p2 is in l2_2 after step 29. ✓

But I think there's a more efficient plan we can come up with. Let's revise:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1 (Move truck t1 to pick up packages)
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4 (Load package p1 onto truck t1)
3. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1 (Move to satisfy constraint 1)
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 (Unload p1 in l1_5 to satisfy constraint 1)
5. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1 (Return to get p2)
6. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (Load p2 onto truck t1)
7. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1 (Move to l1_2 for constraint 4)
8. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (Unload p2 in l1_2 to satisfy constraint 4)
9. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_5 c1 (Return to get p1)
10. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 (Load p1 back onto truck t1)
11. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_2 c1 (Return to pick up p2)
12. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (Load p2 back onto truck t1)
13. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 (Move to airport)
14. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (Unload p1 for air transport)
15. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (Unload p2 for air transport)
16. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (Load p1 onto airplane)
17. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (Load p2 onto airplane)
18. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (Fly to city c2)
19. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 (Unload p1 at destination)
20. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (Unload p2 at destination)
21. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2 (Bring truck t2 to airport)
22. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (Load p1 onto truck t2)
23. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (Load p2 onto truck t2)
24. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2 (Drive to l2_3 for constraint 2)
25. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (Unload p1 in l2_3)
26. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (Unload p2 in l2_3, satisfying constraint 2)
27. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (Load p1 for continuing)
28. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (Load p2 for continuing)
29. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2 (Drive to l2_4 for p1's goal)
30. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (Unload p1 at its goal location)
31. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2 (Drive to l2_2 for p2's goal)
32. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (Unload p2 at its goal location)

This plan is 32 actions, which is longer than our previous plan. That's not what I expected.

Let's revisit the problem statement once more. Maybe there's a more efficient way to achieve all goals and constraints.

I realized the issue: in my revised plan, I'm transporting the packages one at a time, which is inefficient. Let's go back to our original plan:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1 (Bring truck t1 to location of packages)
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4 (Load p1 onto t1)
3. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (Load p2 onto t1)
4. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1 (Drive to l1_5 for constraint 1)
5. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 (Unload p1 in l1_5 to satisfy constraint 1)
6. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 (Load p1 back onto t1)
7. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_2 c1 (Drive to l1_2 for constraint 4)
8. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (Unload p2 in l1_2 to satisfy constraint 4)
9. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (Load p2 back onto t1)
10. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 (Drive to airport)
11. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (Unload p1 for air transport)
12. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (Unload p2 for air transport)
13. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (Load p1 onto a1)
14. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (Load p2 onto a1)
15. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (Fly to city c2)
16. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 (Unload p1 at destination)
17. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (Unload p2 at destination)
18. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2 (Bring truck t2 to airport)
19. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (Load p1 onto t2)
20. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (Load p2 onto t2)
21. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2 (Drive to l2_3 for constraint 2)
22. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (Unload p1 in l2_3)
23. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (Unload p2 in l2_3, satisfying constraint 2)
24. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (Load p1 for continuing)
25. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (Load p2 for continuing)
26. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2 (Drive to l2_4 for p1's goal)
27. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (Unload p1 at its goal location)
28. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2 (Drive to l2_2 for p2's goal)
29. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (Unload p2 at its goal location)

This is 29 actions and satisfies all constraints and goals. 

Wait, there's one more thing to check: 

Constraint 4: "If expression 'Package p2 is in location l1_4' holds in some state s, then expression 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "Package p2 is in location l1_2", "Package p1 is in location l2_5"' must hold at s or at some state after s."

This means I need to ensure that after p2 is in l1_4, either p2 is in l1_2 or p1 is in l2_5. In the initial state, p2 is in l1_4. So, at some later point, I need to either move p2 to l1_2 or move p1 to l2_5. In my plan, I move p2 to l1_2, so that's satisfied.

Let's ensure I'm satisfying all constraints correctly:

Constraint 1: p1 is in l1_5 after step 5. ✓
Constraint 2: Both p1 and p2 are in l2_3 after step 23. ✓
Constraint 3: p2 is in l1_4 initially. ✓
Constraint 4: Since p2 is in l1_4 initially, at some point either p2 should be in l1_2 or p1 should be in l2_5. In our plan, p2 is in l1_2 after step 8. ✓

Goal conditions:
- p1 is in l2_4 after step 27. ✓
- p2 is in l2_2 after step 29. ✓

It seems like our plan with 29 actions is valid and satisfies all constraints.

Actually, one more thing to check:
"loadairplane" is listed twice in the available actions, and "unloadairplane" doesn't appear. I'm assuming the second "loadairplane" should actually be "unloadairplane", as I've used in my plan.

Also, there are a few preconditions and effects for the actions in the problem statement, and I've tried to ensure my plan respects these. Let me double-check that each action in my plan satisfies its preconditions:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1: t1 is in l1_3, and both l1_3 and l1_4 are in c1. ✓
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4: p1 and t1 are both in l1_4. ✓
3. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4: p2 and t1 are both in l1_4. ✓
4. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1: t1 is in l1_4, and both l1_4 and l1_5 are in c1. ✓
5. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5: t1 is in l1_5, and p1 is in t1. ✓
... and so on.

It looks like all actions in my plan satisfy their preconditions, and the effects of each action propagate correctly to subsequent states.

So, the final plan is:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
3. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
4. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1
5. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
6. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
7. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_2 c1
8. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
9. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
10. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
11. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
12. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
13. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
14. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
15. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
16. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
17. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
18. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
19. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
20. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
21. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
22. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
23. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
24. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
25. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
26. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
27. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
28. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2
29. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

This 29-action plan satisfies all goals and constraints.
