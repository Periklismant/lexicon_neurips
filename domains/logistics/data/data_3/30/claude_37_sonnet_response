Let me break down this problem and understand the world state, goals, and constraints:

World state:
- Multiple cities, each with multiple locations, one of which is an airport.
- Trucks can move within a city.
- Airplanes can move between airports.
- Both trucks and airplanes can carry packages.

Initial State:
- Cities: c1, c2
- Locations in city c1: l1_1 (airport), l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5
- Locations in city c2: l2_1 (airport), l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5
- Locations of packages and vehicles:
  - Package t1 is in location l1_4 (this seems to be a mistake, t1 should be a truck, not a package)
  - Package t2 is in location l2_4 (this seems to be a mistake, t2 should be a truck, not a package)
  - Package p1 is in location l2_3
  - Package p2 is in location l2_1
  - Package a1 is in location l1_1 (this seems to be a mistake, a1 should be an airplane, not a package)
  - Package a2 is in location l2_1 (this seems to be a mistake, a2 should be an airplane, not a package)

I believe these are typos, and the correct interpretation should be:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_4
- Truck t2 is in location l2_4
- Package p1 is in location l2_3
- Package p2 is in location l2_1
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

Goal:
- Package p1 is in location l1_3
- Package p2 is in location l2_2

Constraints:
1. At some point, p1 must be in location l2_1.
2. If p1 is in l2_1, then afterward, either p1 must be in l2_3 or p2 must be in l2_1.
3. At some point, p1 must be in location l1_1.
4. If p1 is in l1_1, then afterward, p2 must be in l1_3.
5. At some point, p2 must be in location l2_2.
6. If p2 is in l2_2, then at an earlier point, p1 must have been in l1_4.

Let me think about how to satisfy these constraints and meet the goal:

First, I need to understand the dependencies between these constraints:
- Constraint 6 requires p1 to be in l1_4 before p2 is in l2_2.
- The goal requires p2 to be in l2_2, so p1 must visit l1_4 at some point.
- Constraint 1 and 2 require p1 to visit l2_1 and then either p1 to visit l2_3 or p2 to be in l2_1. Since p1 starts in l2_3, it's easier to have p1 visit l2_1 and then go back to l2_3.
- Constraint 3 and 4 require p1 to visit l1_1 and then p2 to visit l1_3. This means p2 must visit l1_3 before reaching its final goal of l2_2.

Now, I'll try to plan a sequence of actions that satisfies all constraints and meets the goal:

1. Initial State:
   - Truck t1 is in location l1_4
   - Truck t2 is in location l2_4
   - Package p1 is in location l2_3
   - Package p2 is in location l2_1
   - Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
   - Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

2. Move truck t2 to l2_3 to pick up p1:
   `drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2`

3. Load p1 onto truck t2:
   `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3`

4. Drive truck t2 to l2_1 to satisfy constraint 1:
   `drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2`

5. Unload p1 at l2_1:
   `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1`

6. Load p1 onto airplane a2:
   `loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1`

7. Fly a2 to l1_1:
   `flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1`

8. Unload p1 at l1_1 to satisfy constraint 3:
   `unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1`

9. Load p1 onto truck t1:
   `drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1`
   `loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1`

10. Move truck t1 to l1_4 with p1 to satisfy constraint 6:
    `drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1`

11. Move truck t1 to l1_3 to reach the goal for p1:
    `drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1`

12. Unload p1 at l1_3:
    `unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3`

Wait, I realize this plan doesn't fully satisfy the constraints. Let me reconsider:

The problem is that constraint 4 requires p2 to be in l1_3 after p1 is in l1_1, and constraint 6 requires p1 to have been in l1_4 before p2 is in l2_2. Let me re-plan:

1. Move truck t2 to l2_3 to pick up p1:
   `drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2`

2. Load p1 onto truck t2:
   `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3`

3. Drive truck t2 to l2_1 to satisfy constraint 1:
   `drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2`

4. Unload p1 at l2_1:
   `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1`

5. Load p1 onto airplane a2:
   `loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1`

6. Load p2 onto truck t2:
   `loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1`

7. Fly a2 to l1_1:
   `flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1`

8. Unload p1 at l1_1 to satisfy constraint 3:
   `unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1`

9. Drive truck t1 to l1_1:
   `drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1`

10. Load p1 onto truck t1:
    `loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1`

11. Move truck t1 to l1_4 with p1 to satisfy constraint 6:
    `drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1`

12. Move truck t1 to l1_3:
    `drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1`

13. Unload p1 at l1_3 to reach the goal for p1:
    `unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3`

14. Drive truck t2 to l2_2 with p2:
    `drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2`

15. Unload p2 at l2_2 to reach the goal for p2:
    `unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2`

Wait, I just realized that this still doesn't satisfy constraint 4, which requires p2 to be in l1_3 after p1 is in l1_1. Let me adjust the plan again:

1. Move truck t2 to l2_1 to pick up p2:
   `drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2`

2. Load p2 onto truck t2:
   `loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1`

3. Move truck t2 to l2_3 to pick up p1:
   `drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2`

4. Load p1 onto truck t2:
   `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3`

5. Drive truck t2 to l2_1 to satisfy constraint 1:
   `drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2`

6. Unload p1 at l2_1:
   `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1`

7. Load p1 onto airplane a2:
   `loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1`

8. Fly a2 to l1_1:
   `flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1`

9. Unload p1 at l1_1 to satisfy constraint 3:
   `unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1`

10. Load p1 onto truck t1:
    `loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1`

11. Fly a2 back to l2_1:
    `flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1`

12. Load p2 onto airplane a2:
    `loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1`

13. Fly a2 to l1_1:
    `flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1`

14. Move truck t1 to l1_4 with p1 to satisfy constraint 6:
    `drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1`

15. Unload p2 at l1_1:
    `unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1`

16. Load p2 onto truck t1:
    `loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1`

17. Move truck t1 to l1_3:
    `drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1`

18. Unload p2 at l1_3 to satisfy constraint 4:
    `unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3`

19. Load p2 onto airplane a1:
    `loadairplane p2 a1 l1_3`

20. Fly a1 to l2_1:
    `flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1`

Wait, this still doesn't work because airplane a1 is not in l1_3. Let me rethink:

Actually, I think I misinterpreted constraint 4. Let me clarify the constraints:

1. At some point, p1 must be in location l2_1.
2. If p1 is in l2_1, then afterward, either p1 must be in l2_3 or p2 must be in l2_1.
3. At some point, p1 must be in location l1_1.
4. If p1 is in l1_1, then afterward, p2 must be in l1_3.
5. At some point, p2 must be in location l2_2.
6. If p2 is in l2_2, then at an earlier point, p1 must have been in l1_4.

Let me try to create a plan that satisfies all these constraints:

1. Move truck t2 to l2_3 to pick up p1:
   `drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2`

2. Load p1 onto truck t2:
   `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3`

3. Drive truck t2 to l2_1 to satisfy constraint 1:
   `drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2`

4. Unload p1 at l2_1:
   `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1`

5. Load p1 onto airplane a2:
   `loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1`

6. Load p2 onto truck t2:
   `loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1`

7. Fly a2 to l1_1:
   `flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1`

8. Unload p1 at l1_1 to satisfy constraint 3:
   `unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1`

9. Drive truck t1 to l1_1:
   `drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1`

10. Load p1 onto truck t1:
    `loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1`

11. Drive truck t2 to l2_2:
    `drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2`

12. Unload p2 at l2_2 to reach the goal for p2 and satisfy constraint 5:
    `unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2`

13. Move truck t1 to l1_4 with p1 to satisfy constraint 6:
    `drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1`

14. Move truck t1 to l1_3:
    `drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1`

15. Unload p1 at l1_3 to reach the goal for p1:
    `unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3`

Hold on, this still doesn't satisfy constraint 4, which requires p2 to be in l1_3 after p1 is in l1_1. Let me rethink:

I need to move p2 to l1_3 at some point after p1 is in l1_1, and then move p2 back to l2_2 for the final goal. Here's a new plan:

1. Move truck t2 to l2_3 to pick up p1:
   `drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2`

2. Load p1 onto truck t2:
   `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3`

3. Drive truck t2 to l2_1 to satisfy constraint 1:
   `drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2`

4. Unload p1 at l2_1:
   `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1`

5. Load p1 onto airplane a2:
   `loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1`

6. Fly a2 to l1_1:
   `flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1`

7. Unload p1 at l1_1 to satisfy constraint 3:
   `unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1`

8. Load p1 onto truck t1:
    `loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1`

9. Drive truck t1 to l1_4 with p1 to satisfy constraint 6:
   `drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1`

10. Load p2 onto airplane a2:
    `loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1`

11. Fly a2 to l1_1:
    `flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1`

12. Drive truck t1 to l1_3:
    `drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1`

13. Unload p1 at l1_3 to reach the goal for p1:
    `unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3`

14. Drive truck t1 to l1_1:
    `drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1`

15. Unload p2 at l1_1:
    `unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1`

16. Load p2 onto truck t1:
    `loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1`

17. Drive truck t1 to l1_3:
    `drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1`

18. Unload p2 at l1_3 to satisfy constraint 4:
    `unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3`

19. Load p2 onto truck t1:
    `loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3`

20. Drive truck t1 to l1_1:
    `drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1`

21. Unload p2 at l1_1:
    `unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1`

22. Load p2 onto airplane a2:
    `loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1`

23. Fly a2 to l2_1:
    `flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1`

24. Unload p2 at l2_1:
    `unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1`

25. Drive truck t2 to l2_1:
    `drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_1 c2`

26. Load p2 onto truck t2:
    `loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1`

27. Drive truck t2 to l2_2:
    `drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2`

28. Unload p2 at l2_2 to reach the goal for p2:
    `unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2`

Hmm, there's an issue in the plan above. Let me refine it:

Wait, I think I misread the initial state. Let me double-check:

Actually, I'm quite confused by the initial state. It says "Package t1 is in location l1_4" - but t1 should be a truck, not a package. Let me assume this is a typo and proceed with the assumption that:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_4
- Truck t2 is in location l2_4
- Package p1 is in location l2_3
- Package p2 is in location l2_1
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

Let me create a plan again:

1. Move truck t2 to l2_3 to pick up p1:
   `drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2`

2. Load p1 onto truck t2:
   `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3`

3. Drive truck t2 to l2_1 to satisfy constraint 1:
   `drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2`

4. Unload p1 at l2_1:
   `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1`

5. Load p1 onto airplane a2:
   `loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1`

6. Fly a2 to l1_1:
   `flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1`

7. Unload p1 at l1_1 to satisfy constraint 3:
   `unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1`

8. Fly a2 back to l2_1:
   `flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1`

9. Load p2 onto truck t2:
   `loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1`

10. Drive truck t1 to l1_1:
    `drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1`

11. Load p1 onto truck t1:
    `loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1`

12. Drive truck t1 to l1_4 with p1 to satisfy constraint 6:
    `drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1`

13. Drive truck t1 to l1_3:
    `drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1`

14. Unload p1 at l1_3 to reach the goal for p1:
    `unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3`

15. Load p2 onto airplane a2:
    `loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1`

16. Fly a2 to l1_1:
    `flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1`

17. Unload p2 at l1_1:
    `unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1`

18. Load p2 onto truck t1:
    `loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1`

19. Drive truck t1 to l1_3:
    `drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1`

20. Unload p2 at l1_3 to satisfy constraint 4:
    `unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3`

21. Load p2 onto truck t1:
    `loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3`

22. Drive truck t1 to l1_1:
    `drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1`

23. Unload p2 at l1_1:
    `unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1`

24. Load p2 onto airplane a1:
    `loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1`

25. Fly a1 to l2_1:
    `flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1`

26. Unload p2 at l2_1:
    `unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1`

27. Load p2 onto truck t2:
    `loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1`

28. Drive truck t2 to l2_2:
    `drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2`

29. Unload p2 at l2_2 to reach the goal for p2 and satisfy constraint 5:
    `unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2`

Wait, I'm getting confused again. Let me carefully reread the problem:

Initial state:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_4
- Truck t2 is in location l2_4
- Package p1 is in location l2_3
- Package p2 is in location l2_1
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

Goal:
- Package p1 is in location l1_3
- Package p2 is in location l2_2

Constraints:
1. At some point, p1 must be in location l2_1.
2. If p1 is in l2_1, then afterward, either p1 must be in l2_3 or p2 must be in l2_1.
3. At some point, p1 must be in location l1_1.
4. If p1 is in l1_1, then afterward, p2 must be in l1_3.
5. At some point, p2 must be in location l2_2.
6. If p2 is in l2_2, then at an earlier point, p1 must have been in l1_4.

Let me try to plan a sequence of actions that satisfies all constraints and reaches the goal:

1. Initial situation:
   - Truck t1 is in location l1_4
   - Truck t2 is in location l2_4
   - Package p1 is in location l2_3
   - Package p2 is in location l2_1
   - Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
   - Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

2. Move truck t2 to l2_3 to pick up p1:
   `drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2`

3. Load p1 onto truck t2:
   `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3`

4. Drive truck t2 to l2_1 to satisfy constraint 1:
   `drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2`

5. Unload p1 at l2_1 (constraint 1 satisfied):
   `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1`

At this point, constraint 2 is automatically satisfied because p2 is already in l2_1 according to the initial state.

6. Load p1 onto airplane a2:
   `loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1`

7. Fly a2 to l1_1:
   `flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1`

8. Unload p1 at l1_1 (constraint 3 satisfied):
   `unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1`

Now, according to constraint 4, p2 must be in l1_3 at some point after p1 is in l1_1:

9. Fly a2 back to l2_1:
   `flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1`

10. Load p2 onto airplane a2:
    `loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1`

11. Fly a2 to l1_1:
    `flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1`

12. Unload p2 at l1_1:
    `unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1`

13. Load p2 onto truck t1:
    `loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1`

14. Drive truck t1 to l1_3:
    `drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1`

15. Unload p2 at l1_3 (constraint 4 satisfied):
    `unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3`

According to constraint 6, p1 must be in l1_4 before p2 is in l2_2. p1 is currently in l1_1 and p2 is in l1_3:

16. Load p1 onto truck t1:
    `loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1`

17. Drive truck t1 to l1_4 (constraint 6 satisfied):
    `drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1`

18. Drive truck t1 to l1_3:
    `drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1`

19. Unload p1 at l1_3 (goal for p1 satisfied):
    `unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3`

Now, let's move p2 to its final goal:

20. Load p2 onto truck t1:
    `loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3`

21. Drive truck t1 to l1_1:
    `drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1`

22. Unload p2 at l1_1:
    `unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1`

23. Load p2 onto airplane a1:
    `loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1`

24. Fly a1 to l2_1:
    `flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1`

25. Unload p2 at l2_1:
    `unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1`

26. Load p2 onto truck t2:
    `loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1`

27. Drive truck t2 to l2_2:
    `drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2`

28. Unload p2 at l2_2 (goal for p2 satisfied, constraint 5 satisfied):
    `unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2`

Oh I think there are problems with my plan:

1. After step 15, I'm trying to load p1 onto truck t1, but p1 is not in the same location as truck t1. p1 is in l1_1, and I've moved truck t1 to l1_3 in step 14.

2. I'm also confusing myself a bit with the constraints. Let me restate and simplify:

Constraints:
1. At some point, p1 must be in location l2_1.
2. If p1 is in l2_1, then afterward, either p1 must go back to l2_3 or p2 must be in l2_1.
3. At some point, p1 must be in location l1_1.
4. If p1 is in l1_1, then afterward, p2 must be in l1_3.
5. At some point, p2 must be in location l2_2.
6. If p2 is in l2_2, then p1 must have been in l1_4 earlier.

Let me try to plan it once more, more carefully:

1. Initial situation:
   - Truck t1 is in location l1_4
   - Truck t2 is in location l2_4
   - Package p1 is in location l2_3
   - Package p2 is in location l2_1
   - Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
   - Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

2. Drive truck t2 to l2_3:
   `drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2`

3. Load p1 onto truck t2:
   `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3`

4. Drive truck t2 to l2_1:
   `drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2`

5. Unload p1 at l2_1 (constraint 1 satisfied):
   `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1`

At this point, constraint 2 is automatically satisfied because p2 is already in l2_1 according to the initial state.

6. Load p1 onto airplane a2:
   `loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1`

7. Fly a2 to l1_1:
   `flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1`

8. Unload p1 at l1_1 (constraint 3 satisfied):
   `unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1`

9. Load p1 onto truck t1:
   `loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1`

10. Drive truck t1 to l1_4 (constraint 6 satisfied in advance):
    `drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1`

11. Drive truck t1 to l1_3:
    `drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1`

12. Unload p1 at l1_3 (goal for p1 satisfied):
    `unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3`

Now, to satisfy constraint 4, p2 must be in l1_3 at some point after p1 is in l1_1:

13. Fly a2 back to l2_1:
    `flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1`

14. Load p2 onto airplane a2:
    `loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1`

15. Fly a2 to l1_1:
    `flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1`

16. Unload p2 at l1_1:
    `unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1`

17. Drive truck t1 to l1_1:
    `drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1`

18. Load p2 onto truck t1:
    `loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1`

19. Drive truck t1 to l1_3:
    `drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1`

20. Unload p2 at l1_3 (constraint 4 satisfied):
    `unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3`

Now, to move p2 to its final goal l2_2:

21. Load p2 onto truck t1:
    `loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3`

22. Drive truck t1 to l1_1:
    `drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1`

23. Unload p2 at l1_1:
    `unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1`

24. Load p2 onto airplane a1:
    `loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1`

25. Fly a1 to l2_1:
    `flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1`

26. Unload p2 at l2_1:
    `unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1`

27. Drive truck t2 to l2_1:
    `drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_1 c2`

This step seems redundant, let me revise the plan:

27. Load p2 onto truck t2:
    `loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1`

28. Drive truck t2 to l2_2:
    `drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2`

29. Unload p2 at l2_2 (goal for p2 satisfied, constraint 5 satisfied):
    `unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2`

Let me verify this again. At this point:
- p1 is in l1_3 (goal satisfied)
- p2 is in l2_2 (goal satisfied)
- p1 was in l2_1 (constraint 1 satisfied)
- p2 was in l2_1 after p1 was in l2_1 (constraint 2 satisfied)
- p1 was in l1_1 (constraint 3 satisfied)
- p2 was in l1_3 after p1 was in l1_1 (constraint 4 satisfied)
- p2 is in l2_2 (constraint a 5 satisfied)
- p1 was in l1_4 before p2 was in l2_2 (constraint 6 satisfied)

I believe this plan satisfies all constraints and goals. Let me clean up the plan:

1. `drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2`
2. `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3`
3. `drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2`
4. `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1`
5. `loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1`
6. `flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1`
7. `unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1`
8. `loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1`
9. `drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1`
10. `drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1`
11. `unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3`
12. `drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1`
13. `flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1`
14. `loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1`
15. `flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1`
16. `unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1`
17. `loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1`
18. `drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1`
19. `unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3`
20. `loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3`
21. `drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1`
22. `unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1`
23. `loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1`
24. `flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1`
25. `unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1`
26. `loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1`
27. `drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2`
28. `unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2`

Actually, let me double check if there are any mistakes. 

One mistake is in step 12, I have the truck moving from l1_3 to l1_1, but I don't need to do that right away. Let me fix the plan:

1. `drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2`
2. `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3`
3. `drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2`
4. `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1`
5. `loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1`
6. `flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1`
7. `unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1`
8. `loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1`
9. `drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1`
10. `drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1`
11. `unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3`
12. `flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1`
13. `loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1`
14. `flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1`
15. `unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1`
16. `loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3`

Wait, that's wrong - in step 16 I'm trying to load p2 onto t1 but they are in different locations. Let me fix this:

1. `drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2`
2. `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3`
3. `drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2`
4. `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1`
5. `loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1`
6. `flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1`
7. `unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1`
8. `loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1`
9. `drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1`
10. `drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1`
11. `unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3`
12. `drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1`
13. `flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1`
14. `loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1`
15. `flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1`
16. `unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1`
17. `loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1`
18. `drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1`
19. `unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3`
20. `loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3`
21. `drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1`
22. `unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1`
23. `loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1`
24. `flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1`
25. `unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1`
26. `loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1`
27. `drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2`
28. `unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2`

This plan seems to have a lot of unnecessary steps. let me optimize it:

1. `drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2`
2. `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3`
3. `drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2`
4. `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1` (p1 visited l2_1, constraint 1 satisfied)
5. `loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1`
6. `flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1`
7. `unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1` (p1 visited l1_1, constraint 3 satisfied)
8. `loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1`
9. `drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1` (p1 visited l1_4 before p2 is in l2_2, constraint 6 satisfied)
10. `drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1`
11. `unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3` (Goal: p1 is in l1_3, satisfied)
12. `drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1`
13. `flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1`
14. `loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1`
15. `flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1`
16. `unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1`
17. `loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1`
18. `drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1`
19. `unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3` (p2 visited l1_3 after p1 was in l1_1, constraint 4 satisfied)
20. `loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3`
21. `drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1`
22. `unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1`
23. `loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1`
24. `flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1`
25. `unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1`
26. `loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1`
27. `drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2`
28. `unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2` (Goal: p2 is in l2_2, satisfied, and constraint 5 satisfied)

In this plan, I've loaded and unloaded p2 multiple times, which is inefficient. Let's see if I can optimize it:

1. `drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2`
2. `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3`
3. `drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2`
4. `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1` (p1 visited l2_1, constraint 1 satisfied)
5. `loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1`
6. `flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1`
7. `unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1` (p1 visited l1_1, constraint 3 satisfied)
8. `loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1`
9. `drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1` (p1 visited l1_4 before p2 is in l2_2, constraint 6 satisfied)
10. `drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1`
11. `unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3` (Goal: p1 is in l1_3, satisfied)
12. `drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1`
13. `flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1`
14. `loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1`
15. `flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1`
16. `unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1`
17. `loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1`
18. `drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1`
19. `unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3` (p2 visited l1_3 after p1 was in l1_1, constraint 4 satisfied)
20. `loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3`
21. `drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1`
22. `unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1`
23. `loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1`
24. `flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1`
25. `unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1`
26. `loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1`
27. `drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2`
28. `unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2` (Goal: p2 is in l2_2, satisfied, and constraint 5 satisfied)

Actually, constraint 2 is a bit confusing. Let me reread it:
"If expression 'Package p1 is in location l2_1' holds in some state s, then expression 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "Package p1 is in location l2_3", "Package p2 is in location l2_1"' must hold at s or at some state after s"

This means that once p1 is in l2_1, then at that state or some state after that, either p1 must be back in l2_3 or p2 must be in l2_1. In the initial state, p2 is already in l2_1, so this constraint is automatically satisfied once p1 reaches l2_1 (which happens in step 4).

In fact, I can probably make this plan much more efficient because of the initial state:
- p1 starts in l2_3 and needs to end up in l1_3
- p2 starts in l2_1 and needs to end up in l2_2

Let's create a more efficient plan:

1. `drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2`
2. `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3`
3. `drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2` (At this point, p1 is in truck t2, and both are in l2_1, so constraint 1 is satisfied)
4. `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1` (p2 is already in l2_1, so constraint 2 is satisfied)
5. `loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1`
6. `flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1`
7. `unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1` (p1 is in l1_1, so constraint 3 is satisfied)
8. `loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1`
9. `drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1` (p1 is in l1_4, satisfying part of constraint 6)
10. `drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1`
11. `unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3` (Goal: p1 is in l1_3, satisfied)

Now, to satisfy constraint 4, we need p2 to be in l1_3 after p1 has been in l1_1:

12. `drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1`
13. `flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1`
14. `loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1`
15. `flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1`
16. `unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1`
17. `loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1`
18. `drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1`
19. `unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3` (p2 is in l1_3 after p1 was in l1_1, so constraint 4 is satisfied)

Finally, to satisfy constraint 5 and the goal for p2:

20. `loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3`
21. `drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1`
22. `unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1`
23. `loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1`
24. `flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1`
25. `unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1`
26. `loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1`
27. `drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2`
28. `unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2` (Goal: p2 is in l2_2, satisfied, and constraint 5 satisfied)

This is as optimized as I can make the plan while ensuring all constraints and goals are met. Let's review once more:

- p1 visits l2_1 (constraint 1)
- After p1 is in l2_1, p2 is in l2_1 (constraint 2)
- p1 visits l1_1 (constraint 3)
- After p1 is in l1_1, p2 visits l1_3 (constraint 4)
- p2 reaches l2_2 (constraint 5)
- Before p2 is in l2_2, p1 visits l1_4 (constraint 6)
- Final goal: p1 is in l1_3, p2 is in l2_2 (satisfied)

All constraints and goals are satisfied by this plan. Perhaps the plan could be made even more efficient, but this seems pretty good given the complexity of the constraints.

1. `drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2`
2. `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3`
