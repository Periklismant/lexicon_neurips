Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. First, I need to understand the initial state and the goal. The goal is to have p1 in l1_3 and p2 in l2_2. Let's look at where everything starts.

Initial state:
- p1 is in l2_3 (city c2)
- p2 is in l2_1 (which is an airport in c2)
- Trucks t1 is in l1_4 (c1), t2 in l2_4 (c2)
- Airplanes a1 is in l1_1 (airport in c1), a2 in l2_1 (airport in c2)

Constraints to satisfy:
1. p1 must be in l2_1 at least once.
2. If p1 is in l2_1 in state s, then either p1 is in l2_3 or p2 is in l2_1 must hold in s or later.
3. p1 must be in l1_1 at least once.
4. If p1 is in l1_1 in state s, then p2 must be in l1_3 in s or later.
5. p2 must be in l2_2 at least once.
6. If p2 is in l2_2 in a state, then p1 was in l1_4 before.

So the plan needs to ensure all these constraints are met while achieving the final goal.

Let's start with p2. The goal is to have p2 in l2_2. p2 is initially at l2_1 (airport in c2). Since l2_2 is in c2, maybe use a truck. But the truck t2 is in l2_4. So need to move t2 to l2_1 to pick up p2? Wait, but p2 is already in l2_1. Wait, t2 is in l2_4. So perhaps drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1, load p2 into t2, then drive to l2_2 and unload. But wait, can the truck move between any locations in the same city? Yes. So:

Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1 (c2). Then load p2 into t2, then drive to l2_2 and unload. That would get p2 to l2_2. But the constraint 6 says that when p2 is in l2_2, p1 must have been in l1_4 before. So in the plan, p1 must have been in l1_4 at some point before the state where p2 is in l2_2. But p1 starts in l2_3. So how does p1 get to l1_4?

Wait, p1 is initially in l2_3 (c2). To get it to l1_3 (c1), we need to move it between cities. That requires an airplane. So perhaps load p1 onto a truck in c2, drive to the airport (l2_1), load onto airplane a2, fly to l1_1 (c1's airport), then unload, load onto truck t1 (which is in l1_4 initially), drive to l1_3, and unload.

But let's break this down. Let's start with p1:

p1 is in l2_3 (c2). To get it to l1_3 (c1), need to:

1. Move p1 to an airport in c2 (l2_1) using a truck. The available truck in c2 is t2, which is in l2_4. So first, drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_3 (c2). Then load p1 into t2. Then drive t2 to l2_1. Then unload p1 into l2_1. Then load p1 onto airplane a2 (which is already at l2_1). Fly a2 to l1_1. Unload p1 at l1_1. Then load p1 onto truck t1 (which is in l1_4). Wait, but t1 is in l1_4. So need to drive t1 to l1_1? Or is there another truck? No, t1 is the truck in c1. So drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1 (c1). Then load p1 into t1. Then drive t1 to l1_3 and unload.

But let's check the constraints:

- Constraint 1: p1 must be in l2_1. Yes, during the transfer from l2_3 to a2.

- Constraint 2: When p1 is in l2_1, either p1 is in l2_3 (which was before, but now p1 is in l2_1, so maybe after that, p2 is in l2_1. Wait, p2 is initially in l2_1. So when p1 is in l2_1 (after unloading from truck t2), p2 is already there. So the condition holds because "Package p2 is in location l2_1" is true at that state. So that satisfies the second constraint.

- Constraint 3: p1 must be in l1_1. Yes, after flying to l1_1 and unloading from a2.

- Constraint 4: When p1 is in l1_1, then p2 must be in l1_3 in s or later. Wait, the final goal has p2 in l2_2, which is in c2. So how can p2 be in l1_3? That's in c1. That seems conflicting. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. The fourth constraint says: If p1 is in l1_1 in state s, then p2 must be in l1_3 at s or later. But p2's final destination is l2_2. So how can p2 be in l1_3? That's impossible unless we move p2 to c1. But the goal requires p2 to be in l2_2, which is in c2. So this is a problem. 

Wait, the fourth constraint says that if p1 is in l1_1 at some state s, then p2 must be in l1_3 at s or after. But p2's final position is l2_2. So we have to arrange that after moving p1 to l1_1, we somehow get p2 to l1_3, but then move it back to l2_2. That complicates things. But that might not be possible. Wait, maybe the constraints are not all required to be true in the final state, but just at some state. Let me recheck the constraints.

Constraints:

4. If p1 is in l1_1 in state s, then p2 is in l1_3 must hold at s or some state after s.

So, when we move p1 to l1_1 (which is necessary to load onto truck t1), we have to ensure that after that, p2 is moved to l1_3. But p2's goal is in l2_2. So we need to first move p2 to l1_3, then move it back to c2's l2_2. But how?

But moving p2 from c2 to c1 would require using an airplane. Let's think.

But p2 is initially in l2_1 (airport). So maybe load p2 onto a2, fly to l1_1, unload, then load onto truck t1, drive to l1_3, then unload. Then, to get it back to c2, load onto a1 (which is in l1_1) or a2 (which was flown to l1_1), fly back to l2_1, unload, then use truck t2 to drive to l2_2. But this seems very lengthy. But maybe necessary to satisfy the constraints.

But let's check all constraints again:

Constraint 4 requires that if p1 is in l1_1 (which it will be when unloaded from a1 or a2), then p2 must be in l1_3 at some point after. So, after p1 is in l1_1, we have to get p2 to l1_3. But the final goal for p2 is l2_2. So perhaps after moving p2 to l1_3, we need to move it back to c2. That adds steps but might be necessary.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to satisfy the constraint without moving p2 all the way. Let me think. Wait, maybe the constraint only requires that if p1 is in l1_1 in some state, then in that state or a later one, p2 is in l1_3. So, if during the process, after p1 is in l1_1, we arrange to move p2 to l1_3, even temporarily, then the constraint is satisfied. Then, after that, we can move p2 back to c2.

But how to do this?

Let's outline the steps:

For p1:

1. In c2, load p1 into truck t2 (after moving t2 to l2_3).
2. Drive t2 to l2_1 (airport).
3. Unload p1 into l2_1.
4. Load p1 onto airplane a2 (which is at l2_1).
5. Fly a2 to l1_1 (c1's airport).
6. Unload p1 into l1_1.
7. Load p1 into truck t1 (drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1 first? Because t1 starts in l1_4.)
   - So, need to drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1.
8. Then drive t1 to l1_3 and unload p1. That achieves the goal for p1.

For p2:

1. Initially in l2_1. Need to get to l2_2. So use truck t2 (but t2 is in l2_1 after step 2 above). Wait, step 2 is driving t2 to l2_1. Then after step 3 (unloading p1), t2 is in l2_1. So, then:

   a. Load p2 into t2 (since p2 is in l2_1).
   b. Drive t2 to l2_2 (same city c2).
   c. Unload p2 into l2_2. That's the goal.

But the constraint 6 says that when p2 is in l2_2, there must be an earlier state where p1 is in l1_4. But p1 is initially in l2_3. So how does p1 get to l1_4? Wait, maybe when we drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1 to pick up p1, that leaves t1 in l1_1. But p1 is in l1_1 after step 6. So to satisfy constraint 6: p2's arrival in l2_2 must have a prior state where p1 is in l1_4. But p1 starts in l2_3, not l1_4. The initial position of t1 is l1_4, but p1 is not there. Wait, the initial state says "Package t1 is in location l1_4". Wait, wait, the original state says:

Wait, looking back at the original state description:

"The original state of the world is the following:
	"Location l1_1 is in city c1"
	...
	"Package t1 is in location l1_4"
	"Package t2 is in location l2_4"
	"Package p1 is in location l2_3"
	"Package p2 is in location l2_1"
	"Package a1 is in location l1_1"
	"Package a2 is in location l2_1""

Wait, there's a mistake here. The objects are listed as "truck t1", "truck t2", etc. But the original state says "Package t1 is in location l1_4". That must be a typo. Because t1 is a truck, not a package. So perhaps it's a formatting error. The correct initial positions should be:

- Truck t1 is in l1_4
- Truck t2 is in l2_4
- Airplane a1 is in l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in l2_1
- Packages p1 in l2_3, p2 in l2_1.

So the initial state is:

Trucks:
- t1 (c1) at l1_4
- t2 (c2) at l2_4

Airplanes:
- a1 at l1_1 (c1)
- a2 at l2_1 (c2)

Packages:
- p1 at l2_3 (c2)
- p2 at l2_1 (c2)

So for p1 to get to l1_3 (c1), we need to move it via airplane.

So steps for p1:

1. Move p1 from l2_3 (c2) to l2_1 (airport in c2) using truck t2.
   - Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_3.
   - Load p1 into t2.
   - Drive t2 to l2_1.
   - Unload p1 into l2_1.

2. Load p1 into a2 (which is at l2_1).
3. Fly a2 to l1_1 (c1's airport).
4. Unload p1 into l1_1.
5. Use truck t1 (in c1) to move p1 to l1_3.
   - Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1.
   - Load p1 into t1.
   - Drive t1 to l1_3.
   - Unload p1.

For p2:

1. Since p2 is already in l2_1 (airport), but needs to be in l2_2. Use truck t2 (after it's back in l2_1).

   - After step 1.3 (unload p1 in l2_1), t2 is in l2_1.
   - Load p2 into t2.
   - Drive t2 to l2_2.
   - Unload p2.

But let's check the constraints.

Constraint 1: p1 must be in l2_1. That happens after unloading from t2 in step 1.3.

Constraint 2: When p1 is in l2_1, then either p1 is in l2_3 or p2 is in l2_1. At that state (after step 1.3), p2 is in l2_1 (initial position). So that's satisfied.

Constraint 3: p1 must be in l1_1. That happens after unloading from a2 in step 4.

Constraint 4: If p1 is in l1_1 (step 4), then p2 must be in l1_3 at s or after. But p2 is in l2_1 and needs to go to l2_2. So to satisfy this, we need to get p2 to l1_3 after p1 is in l1_1. But how? Because p2 is in c2, to get it to c1 requires using an airplane.

So perhaps after moving p1 to l1_1, we need to fly p2 to c1, then to l1_3, and then back to c2. That complicates things but is necessary for the constraint.

So adjusting the plan:

After step 4 (p1 in l1_1), we need to move p2 to l1_3.

Steps for p2:

1. Load p2 into a2 (which is at l2_1 after flying to l1_1? Wait, no. When a2 flies to l1_1, it's there. So after flying a2 to l1_1 (step 3), a2 is in l1_1. Then, to move p2 from l2_1 to c1, we need another airplane. Wait, a1 is in l1_1. So to get p2 to c1, perhaps use a1.

But p2 is in l2_1 (c2's airport). To fly a1 to l2_1? But a1 starts in l1_1. So steps:

- Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1 (c2's airport).
- Load p2 into a1.
- Fly a1 back to l1_1.
- Unload p2 into l1_1.
- Load p2 into truck t1 (which is in l1_1 after step 5's drive).
   - Wait, t1 was driven from l1_4 to l1_1 in step 5 (drive t1 to l1_1 to load p1). Then after loading p1, drive to l1_3. So after unloading p1 in l1_3, t1 is in l1_3. So maybe after that, drive t1 back to l1_1 to pick up p2.

This is getting complicated. Let's outline the steps again with the constraints in mind.

Alternative approach:

1. Move p1 from l2_3 to l2_1 using t2.
2. Load p1 onto a2 and fly to l1_1.
3. Unload p1 into l1_1. Now, constraint 4 requires that p2 must be in l1_3 after this.
4. To get p2 to l1_3, we need to bring it to c1. So steps for p2:
   a. Load p2 into a2 (but a2 is in l1_1 now). Wait, no. After flying a2 to l1_1, a2 is there. To get p2 to c1, we need to use another airplane. Maybe a1, which is in l1_1. Fly a1 to l2_1 (c2's airport), load p2 into a1, fly back to l1_1, unload p2. Then use truck t1 to drive to l1_3.

But this adds several steps. Let's try to outline this:

After p1 is in l1_1 (step 3):

4. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
5. Load p2 into a1.
6. Fly a1 back to l1_1.
7. Unload p2 into l1_1.
8. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1 (if not already there; in step 3, t1 was in l1_4. So need to drive it to l1_1 to load p1. Wait, earlier steps for p1:

Wait, let's correct the steps for p1:

Original steps for p1:

1. Drive t2 (c2) from l2_4 to l2_3.
2. Load p1 into t2.
3. Drive t2 to l2_1.
4. Unload p1 into l2_1.
5. Load p1 into a2 (which is at l2_1).
6. Fly a2 to l1_1.
7. Unload p1 into l1_1.
8. Drive t1 (c1) from l1_4 to l1_1.
9. Load p1 into t1.
10. Drive t1 to l1_3.
11. Unload p1. Done for p1.

So after step 7, p1 is in l1_1. So constraint 4 requires that p2 must be in l1_3 after this. So steps for p2 must include moving it to l1_3, then back to c2.

But p2 is in l2_1. To get it to l1_3:

12. Fly a1 (which is at l1_1) to l2_1.
13. Load p2 into a1.
14. Fly a1 back to l1_1.
15. Unload p2 into l1_1.
16. Load p2 into t1 (which is in l1_1 after step 8 and step 10? Wait, step 8: drive t1 to l1_1. Then step 9: load p1 into t1. Then step 10: drive to l1_3. So after step 10, t1 is in l1_3. So to load p2 into t1, need to drive t1 back to l1_1.

17. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1.
18. Load p2 into t1.
19. Drive t1 to l1_3.
20. Unload p2 into l1_3. Now constraint 4 is satisfied.

Then, to get p2 back to c2:

21. Load p2 into a1 (at l1_1).
22. Fly a1 to l2_1.
23. Unload p2 into l2_1.
24. Load p2 into t2 (which is at l2_1 after step 3).
25. Drive t2 to l2_2.
26. Unload p2. Now p2 is in l2_2, satisfying the goal.

But this adds a lot of steps. But the problem requires an optimal plan (shortest possible). This seems too long. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Alternative idea: After p1 is in l1_1 (step 7), use a different approach for p2. Since p2 is in l2_1, and we need to get it to l2_2, but also have to satisfy constraint 4 by getting p2 to l1_3 after p1 is in l1_1.

But maybe we can do the following:

After step 7 (p1 in l1_1), fly a2 (which is now in l1_1) back to l2_1. Wait, but a2 was used to carry p1 to l1_1. If we fly a2 back to l2_1, we can load p2 into a2 and fly it to l1_1 again.

But perhaps:

12. Fly a2 from l1_1 to l2_1.
13. Load p2 into a2.
14. Fly a2 to l1_1.
15. Unload p2 into l1_1.
16. Load p2 into t1 (drive t1 to l1_1 again? But t1 is in l1_3 after step 10. So need to drive back.

17. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1.
18. Load p2 into t1.
19. Drive t1 to l1_3.
20. Unload p2. Now p2 is in l1_3. Constraint 4 satisfied.

Then fly p2 back to c2:

21. Load p2 into a2 (at l1_1 after step 14).
22. Fly a2 to l2_1.
23. Unload p2 into l2_1.
24. Load p2 into t2 (which is in l2_1).
25. Drive t2 to l2_2.
26. Unload p2.

Still many steps. But maybe this is necessary due to the constraints.

Additionally, constraint 6 says that when p2 is in l2_2, there must be an earlier state where p1 is in l1_4. p1 starts in l2_3, but in the initial state, t1 is in l1_4. Wait, p1 is not in l1_4 initially. So to satisfy constraint 6, we need p1 to be in l1_4 at some point before p2 is in l2_2. But p1's path is from l2_3 to l2_1 to l1_1 to l1_3. It never goes to l1_4. So how?

Ah, this is a problem. The constraint requires that when p2 is in l2_2, there must have been a prior state where p1 was in l1_4. But in the current plan, p1 is never in l1_4. So we need to arrange for p1 to be in l1_4 at some point before p2 reaches l2_2.

But how? p1 starts in l2_3. To get it into l1_4, we would need to transport it there. But l1_4 is in c1. So after p1 is in l1_3 (its goal), maybe we move it to l1_4 and then back. But that would add steps. Alternatively, maybe during the transportation of p1, we can make a detour.

Wait, the initial state of t1 is in l1_4. So when we drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1 (step 8), p1 is loaded into t1 (which is now in l1_1), then driven to l1_3. So p1 is never in l1_4. So to get p1 into l1_4, perhaps after unloading p1 in l1_3, load it back into t1, drive to l1_4, and unload. Then, after that, proceed to move p2 to l2_2.

But this would satisfy constraint 6. Let's see:

After p1 is in l1_3 (step 11), load p1 back into t1, drive to l1_4, unload. Then, proceed with moving p2.

But how does this fit into the steps?

Adding:

12. Load p1 into t1 (in l1_3).
13. Drive t1 to l1_4.
14. Unload p1 into l1_4. Now constraint 6 is satisfied (p1 is in l1_4 before p2 is in l2_2).

Then proceed with moving p2 to l2_2.

But this requires additional steps. However, the problem requires the plan to be optimal (shortest possible). This seems to add steps, but perhaps necessary.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to have p1 pass through l1_4 during its transportation. For example, when moving t1 from l1_4 to l1_1, perhaps stop at l1_4? But that's where it starts. No, that doesn't make sense. So the only way to get p1 into l1_4 is to take it there after it's been loaded into t1.

Wait, when t1 is in l1_4 (initial state), and p1 is in l2_3. So the only way for p1 to be in l1_4 is to be loaded into t1 while t1 is in l1_4. But to do that, we need to have p1 in l1_4. But p1 is in c2. So how can we get p1 to l1_4? It would require flying it to l1_1, then using a truck to drive it to l1_4. But that's part of the original plan.

Wait, in the original plan, p1 is driven from l1_1 to l1_3 via t1. If instead, after loading p1 into t1 in l1_1, we first drive to l1_4, unload p1 there (satisfying constraint 6), then drive back to l1_3. But that adds steps.

For example:

After step 8: Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1.

Step 9: Load p1 into t1.

Step 10: Drive t1 to l1_4.

Step 11: Unload p1 into l1_4.

Step 12: Load p1 into t1 again.

Step 13: Drive t1 to l1_3.

Step 14: Unload p1.

Now, p1 is in l1_3 as required, and was in l1_4 at step 11. Then, when moving p2 to l2_2 (after that), the constraint 6 is satisfied because p1 was in l1_4 before.

But this adds four steps (steps 10-14). Not optimal. But maybe necessary.

Alternatively, after step 8 (t1 in l1_1), load p1 into t1, then drive to l1_4 (step 10), unload (step 11), then drive to l1_3 (step 12), unload (step 13). But this way, p1 is in l1_4 at step 11, which satisfies constraint 6 before p2 is moved to l2_2.

But how does this affect the other constraints?

This adds steps but ensures p1 is in l1_4 before p2 is moved.

But this would require that when p2 is moved to l2_2, there was a prior state where p1 was in l1_4. Which is satisfied.

So integrating this into the plan:

For p1:

1. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_3.
2. Load p1 into t2.
3. Drive t2 to l2_1.
4. Unload p1.
5. Load p1 into a2.
6. Fly a2 to l1_1.
7. Unload p1.
8. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1.
9. Load p1 into t1.
10. Drive t1 to l1_4.
11. Unload p1.
12. Load p1 into t1.
13. Drive t1 to l1_3.
14. Unload p1.

Now, for p2:

After step 3, t2 is in l2_1. So:

15. Load p2 into t2.
16. Drive t2 to l2_2.
17. Unload p2.

But this would satisfy constraint 6, since p1 was in l1_4 at step 11 before p2 is unloaded in step 17.

But what about the other constraints?

Constraint 3 requires p1 to be in l1_1, which happens at step 7.

Constraint 4: When p1 is in l1_1 (step 7), then p2 must be in l1_3 at some point after. But in this plan, p2 is only moved to l2_2. So this is not satisfied. So this approach doesn't work.

Ah, right. Because constraint 4 requires that after p1 is in l1_1, p2 must be in l1_3 at some point. But in the current plan, p2 is moved to l2_2 without ever going to l1_3. So the constraint is not met. Hence, this approach fails.

So we need to find a way to have p2 in l1_3 after p1 is in l1_1.

Thus, the earlier approach of moving p2 to l1_3 via airplane and truck is necessary, even though it adds steps.

So combining all the steps:

For p1:

1. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_3.
2. Load p1 into t2.
3. Drive t2 to l2_1.
4. Unload p1 into l2_1.
5. Load p1 into a2.
6. Fly a2 to l1_1.
7. Unload p1 into l1_1.
8. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1.
9. Load p1 into t1.
10. Drive t1 to l1_3.
11. Unload p1.

For constraint 4:

After step 7, p1 is in l1_1. So we need to get p2 to l1_3.

For p2:

12. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
13. Load p2 into a1.
14. Fly a1 back to l1_1.
15. Unload p2 into l1_1.
16. Drive t1 from l1_3 back to l1_1.
17. Load p2 into t1.
18. Drive t1 to l1_3.
19. Unload p2 into l1_3. Now constraint 4 is satisfied.
20. Load p2 into a1.
21. Fly a1 to l2_1.
22. Unload p2 into l2_1.
23. Load p2 into t2 (which is in l2_1 after step 3).
24. Drive t2 to l2_2.
25. Unload p2 into l2_2. Now goal is achieved.

Additionally, constraint 6 requires that when p2 is in l2_2, there's a prior state where p1 was in l1_4. In this plan, p1 was in l1_4 only if step 8 is the first time t1 moves. But t1 starts in l1_4. So when t1 is driven to l1_1 (step 8), the truck moves, but p1 is not in l1_4. The package p1 is loaded into t1 in l1_1 (step 9), so p1 is in t1, not in l1_4. So p1 has never been in l1_4. So constraint 6 is not satisfied.

Ah, this is a problem. The constraint requires that before p2 is in l2_2, p1 was in l1_4. But in this plan, p1 is never in l1_4. So we need to have p1 in l1_4 at some point before step 25 (unload p2 into l2_2).

So how can we get p1 into l1_4?

Perhaps after unloading p1 in l1_3 (step 11), we drive t1 back to l1_4 and unload p1 there. Then reload and drive back. But that would add steps.

Adding steps:

12. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_4.
13. Unload p1 into l1_4.
14. Load p1 into t1.
15. Drive t1 to l1_3.
16. Unload p1.

Now, between steps 13 and 14, p1 is in l1_4. Then, when p2 is unloaded in l2_2 (step 25), the constraint 6 is satisfied because p1 was in l1_4 at step 13.

But this adds steps and makes the plan longer. Is there a better way?

Alternatively, during the transportation of p1, after loading into t1 (step 9), drive to l1_4 first:

After step 9:

10. Drive t1 to l1_4.
11. Unload p1 into l1_4.
12. Load p1 into t1.
13. Drive t1 to l1_3.
14. Unload p1.

Now, p1 is in l1_4 at step 11. Then proceed with p2's steps.

This way, before p2 is moved to l2_2 (step 25), p1 was in l1_4 at step 11.

So integrating this:

For p1:

1. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_3.
2. Load p1 into t2.
3. Drive t2 to l2_1.
4. Unload p1.
5. Load p1 into a2.
6. Fly a2 to l1_1.
7. Unload p1.
8. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1.
9. Load p1 into t1.
10. Drive t1 to l1_4.
11. Unload p1 into l1_4. (Now constraint 6 is satisfied.)
12. Load p1 into t1.
13. Drive t1 to l1_3.
14. Unload p1.

For p2:

15. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
16. Load p2 into a1.
17. Fly a1 to l1_1.
18. Unload p2.
19. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1.
20. Load p2 into t1.
21. Drive t1 to l1_3.
22. Unload p2.
23. Load p2 into a1.
24. Fly a1 to l2_1.
25. Unload p2.
26. Load p2 into t2.
27. Drive t2 to l2_2.
28. Unload p2.

Now, all constraints should be satisfied:

- Constraint 1: p1 in l2_1 (step 4).
- Constraint 2: When p1 is in l2_1 (step 4), p2 is in l2_1 (initial) → satisfied.
- Constraint 3: p1 in l1_1 (step 7).
- Constraint 4: After p1 is in l1_1 (step 7), p2 is in l1_3 (step 22).
- Constraint 5: p2 in l2_2 (step 28).
- Constraint 6: Before p2 is in l2_2 (step 28), p1 was in l1_4 (step 11).

This plan satisfies all constraints and the goals. However, it's quite long. But the problem requires an optimal plan with the shortest possible length. Let's see if we can find a more efficient way.

Alternative Idea: Can we use the same airplane for multiple trips?

For example, after moving p1 to l1_1 (step 7), use a2 to fly back to l2_1 and pick up p2.

But a2 is in l1_1 after step 6. So steps:

7. Unload p1 into l1_1.
8. Fly a2 back to l2_1.
9. Load p2 into a2.
10. Fly a2 to l1_1.
11. Unload p2 into l1_1.
12. Load p2 into t1 (drive t1 to l1_1).
13. Drive t1 to l1_3.
14. Unload p2 into l1_3. (Constraint 4 met.)
15. Load p2 into a1 (which is in l1_1).
16. Fly a1 to l2_1.
17. Unload p2.
18. Load p2 into t2.
19. Drive t2 to l2_2.
20. Unload p2.

Meanwhile, for p1:

After step 7, drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1 (step 8 in previous plan), load p1, drive to l1_4 (step 10), unload (step 11), then to l1_3.

But this still requires many steps. 

Wait, maybe the steps for p1 can be optimized:

Instead of driving t1 to l1_4, maybe while moving p1 from l1_1 to l1_3, pass through l1_4.

But the cities' locations: c1 has l1_1 (airport), l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5. So a truck can drive from l1_1 to l1_4 directly? Or must they move step by step? The problem statement says trucks can move between any locations in the same city. So the drive action can go from l1_1 to l1_4 directly.

So, to get p1 into l1_4:

After loading p1 into t1 at l1_1 (step 9), drive t1 to l1_4 (step 10), unload p1 (step 11), then drive to l1_3 (step 13), unload (step 14). This way, p1 is in l1_4, satisfying constraint 6 before p2 is moved.

But for p2, after being unloaded into l1_3 (step 14), it needs to be flown back to c2. This adds steps but is necessary.

Alternatively, after getting p2 to l1_3, can we move it to l1_4 and then to l2_2? No, because l1_4 is in c1 and l2_2 is in c2. So must use an airplane.

This seems unavoidable. So the plan has to include these steps.

But the problem says to provide an optimal plan, i.e., the shortest possible. So is there a way to reduce the steps?

Wait, let's count the steps in the current plan:

Steps for p1:

1. Drive t2 to l2_3.
2. Load p1.
3. Drive to l2_1.
4. Unload.
5. Load into a2.
6. Fly to l1_1.
7. Unload.
8. Drive t1 to l1_1.
9. Load p1.
10. Drive to l1_4.
11. Unload.
12. Load again.
13. Drive to l1_3.
14. Unload.

That's 14 steps for p1.

Steps for p2:

15. Fly a1 to l2_1.
16. Load p2.
17. Fly to l1_1.
18. Unload.
19. Drive t1 to l1_1.
20. Load p2.
21. Drive to l1_3.
22. Unload.
23. Load into a1.
24. Fly to l2_1.
25. Unload.
26. Load into t2.
27. Drive to l2_2.
28. Unload.

Total steps: 28.

This is very long. Is there a smarter way?

Alternative Idea: Use airplane a2 to transport p2 to c1.

Because after a2 is used to fly p1 to l1_1, it's in l1_1. Can we fly a2 back to l2_1 to pick up p2 and bring it to l1_1, then use truck t1 to move p2 to l1_3, then fly it back.

So steps:

For p1:

1. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_3.
2. Load p1 into t2.
3. Drive t2 to l2_1.
4. Unload p1.
5. Load p1 into a2.
6. Fly a2 to l1_1.
7. Unload p1.
8. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1.
9. Load p1 into t1.
10. Drive t1 to l1_4. (To get p1 into l1_4.)
11. Unload p1.
12. Load p1 into t1.
13. Drive t1 to l1_3.
14. Unload p1.

For p2:

15. Fly a2 from l1_1 to l2_1.
16. Load p2 into a2.
17. Fly a2 to l1_1.
18. Unload p2.
19. Load p2 into t1 (which is in l1_3 after step 13? No, t1 is in l1_3 after step 13. So need to drive t1 back to l1_1.

20. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1.
21. Load p2 into t1.
22. Drive t1 to l1_3.
23. Unload p2.
24. Load p2 into a2.
25. Fly a2 to l2_1.
26. Unload p2.
27. Load p2 into t2.
28. Drive t2 to l2_2.
29. Unload p2.

This reduces some steps by reusing a2, but it's still lengthy.

Another Idea: Can we satisfy constraint 4 without moving p2 to l1_3?

The constraint says if p1 is in l1_1, then p2 must be in l1_3 at some point after. So after moving p1 to l1_1 (step 7), we can move p2 to l1_3 and then immediately move it back, but that still requires steps.

Alternatively, can we have p2 in l1_3 at the same time as p1 is in l1_1? No, because p2 is in l2_1 initially.

Wait, the constraint is that if p1 is in l1_1 in state s, then in s or a later state, p2 must be in l1_3. So p2 can be moved to l1_3 after s. So as long as p2 is moved to l1_3 after p1 is in l1_1, it's okay.

But p2's final destination is l2_2, so we have to move it back. This adds steps but is unavoidable.

But maybe there's a way to combine the movement of p1 and p2 to satisfy multiple constraints.

Wait, when p2 is loaded into a2 and flown to l1_1 (steps 15-17), then unloaded into l1_1 (step 18), then loaded into t1 and driven to l1_3 (steps 19-21). This satisfies constraint 4.

Then, to move p2 back to c2, we can use a2 again (which is in l1_1 after step 17).

Steps:

22. Load p2 into a2.
23. Fly a2 to l2_1.
24. Unload p2.
25. Load into t2.
26. Drive to l2_2.
27. Unload.

This reduces steps compared to using a1.

So integrating this:

For p1:

1. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_3.
2. Load p1 into t2.
3. Drive t2 to l2_1.
4. Unload p1.
5. Load p1 into a2.
6. Fly a2 to l1_1.
7. Unload p1.
8. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1.
9. Load p1 into t1.
10. Drive t1 to l1_4.
11. Unload p1. (Now p1 is in l1_4, satisfying constraint 6.)
12. Load p1 into t1.
13. Drive t1 to l1_3.
14. Unload p1.

For p2:

15. Fly a2 from l1_1 to l2_1.
16. Load p2 into a2.
17. Fly a2 to l1_1.
18. Unload p2.
19. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1.
20. Load p2 into t1.
21. Drive t1 to l1_3.
22. Unload p2.
23. Load p2 into a2.
24. Fly a2 to l2_1.
25. Unload p2.
26. Load p2 into t2.
27. Drive t2 to l2_2.
28. Unload p2.

This plan has 28 steps. Is there a way to shorten it?

For example, after step 14, p1 is in l1_3 (goal). For p2, after step 22, p2 is in l1_3 (constraint 4), then flown back to c2.

But perhaps there's a way to avoid driving t1 back and forth. Let's see:

After step 14, t1 is in l1_3. To load p2 into t1, we need to drive it back to l1_1 (step 19). But can we instead use another truck? But there's only t1 in c1. So no.

Alternatively, when a2 brings p2 to l1_1 (step 18), use another truck, but there's none. So t1 is the only truck in c1.

So steps are necessary.

Is there any step that can be merged or skipped?

For example, after step 10 (drive t1 to l1_4), unload p1 (step 11), then load again (step 12) and drive to l1_3 (step 13). This is to have p1 in l1_4. But maybe instead of unloading, just drive through l1_4?

But the truck can't carry the package unless it's loaded. So to have p1 in l1_4, it must be unloaded there.

Alternatively, can we drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_4 and then to l1_3 in one step? No, each drive action moves between two locations.

Hmm. I think this is as optimized as possible given the constraints. So the final plan must include all these steps to satisfy all the constraints and the goal. But the user wants the optimal (shortest) plan, so maybe there's a shorter way I'm missing.

Wait, another Idea: When p1 is flown to l1_1 (step 6), and then driven to l1_4 (step 10), maybe we can drive t1 directly from l1_4 to l1_1 to load p1, but that's what's already done. No, t1 starts in l1_4. So step 8 is driving t1 from l1_4 to l1_1 to load p1, then step 10 is driving back to l1_4. So it's a round trip. This is necessary to get p1 into l1_4.

Alternative Idea: Can we load p1 into t1 in l1_4 without moving t1? No, because p1 is in l1_1. So t1 must be driven to l1_1 to load p1.

Thus, this seems unavoidable.

Another Idea: Use a different airplane to transport p2. For example, use a1 instead of a2 for some steps. a1 starts in l1_1. But p2 is in l2_1. So to use a1 to pick up p2, we need to fly a1 to l2_1 first.

Steps:

For p2:

1. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
2. Load p2 into a1.
3. Fly a1 to l1_1.
4. Unload p2.
5. Load into t1 and drive to l1_3.
6. Then fly back.

But this requires steps similar to using a2. No savings.

Thus, I think the initial long plan is the only way to satisfy all constraints. Therefore, the answer must include all these steps, but I'll need to write them in the correct order.
