Okay, let's see. I need to find a plan to get package p1 to l1_5 and p2 to l2_2, while satisfying all the constraints. Let's start by understanding the initial state and the goal.

First, the initial state:

- p1 is in l2_3 (which is in city c2).
- p2 is in l1_4 (city c1).
- Trucks t1 is in l1_4 (c1), t2 in l2_1 (c2).
- Airplanes a1 is in l1_1 (c1's airport), a2 in l2_1 (c2's airport).

The goal is p1 at l1_5 (c1) and p2 at l2_2 (c2). 

Constraints:

1. At some state, p2 must be in l2_1. But if that happens, there must be an earlier state where either p1 is in l1_3 or p2 is in l2_2. Since the final goal has p2 in l2_2, maybe we can satisfy this by having p2 pass through l2_2 before getting to l2_1. But wait, the final goal is p2 in l2_2, so maybe p2 is moved to l2_1 first and then to l2_2? Hmm, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe during the plan, p2 is in l2_1 (the airport of c2), which might be part of the transportation.

Another constraint: 2. At some point, p2 is in l2_4 or l1_2. Also, p2 must be in l1_1 at some state. And if p2 is in l1_1, then either p1 is in l1_4 or l2_1 at that state or after.

So, let's break down the steps for each package.

Starting with p1: It's in l2_3 (c2). To get to l1_5 (c1), it needs to be transported between cities. Since airplanes can move between airports, maybe load p1 into a truck in c2, drive to the airport l2_1, load onto airplane a2, fly to l1_1, then unload into a truck in c1, drive to l1_5.

Wait, but the initial locations of airplanes: a1 is in l1_1 (c1), a2 in l2_1 (c2). So maybe use a2 to carry p1 from c2 to c1.

But wait, p1 is in l2_3 (c2). So steps for p1:

1. Use truck t2 (which is in l2_1? Wait, initial state says "Package t1 is in l1_4" and "Package t2 is in l2_1". Wait, maybe that's a typo. Wait the original state says:

"Package t1 is in location l1_4"
"Package t2 is in location l2_1"

Wait, that's confusing because t1 and t2 are trucks. So the trucks are at those locations. So truck t1 is in l1_4 (c1), truck t2 in l2_1 (c2). 

So for p1 in l2_3 (c2) to get to l1_5 (c1):

- Need to move p1 from l2_3 to l2_1 (airport) using truck t2. But t2 is in l2_1. So first, drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_3. But wait, can trucks drive within their city? Yes. So:

Action: drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2. Then load p1 into t2, drive back to l2_1. Then unload p1 into a2 (airplane at l2_1). Then fly a2 to l1_1. Then in c1, use truck t1 (which is in l1_4) to drive to l1_1, load p1 into t1, drive to l1_5, unload.

But t1 is in l1_4 initially. So steps for t1 would be drive from l1_4 to l1_1? But l1_1 is the airport. Are l1_1 and l1_4 in the same city (c1)? Yes. So truck t1 can drive from l1_4 to l1_1, load p1, then drive to l1_5.

So for p1:

- In c2: drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_3. Then load p1 into t2. Drive t2 back to l2_1. Unload p1 into a2. Fly a2 to l1_1. Then in c1: drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1. Load p1 into t1. Drive t1 to l1_5. Unload.

Now for p2: starts in l1_4 (c1). Needs to go to l2_2 (c2). So needs to go from c1 to c2. Again, using airplanes. Since a1 is in l1_1 (c1), maybe use a1 to carry p2 to l2_1 (c2's airport). Then use truck t2 (which is in l2_1) to drive to l2_2.

But steps:

p2 is in l1_4. Use truck t1 (which is in l1_4) to load p2. Then drive t1 to l1_1 (airport). Unload p2, load into a1. Fly a1 to l2_1. Then unload p2 into t2 (since t2 is in l2_1). Then drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2. Unload p2.

But wait, let's check the constraints.

Constraints:

1. p2 must be in l2_1 at some state. Which it will be when unloaded from a1 into l2_1. Then, the constraint that if p2 is in l2_1, there must be an earlier state where p1 is in l1_3 or p2 in l2_2. But in our current plan, when p2 is in l2_1, the earlier state would be before p2 is moved to l2_2. But the goal is p2 in l2_2, so maybe after unloading in l2_1 and then driving to l2_2, which would satisfy the second part of the condition (p2 in l2_2). But since the condition is "there must be an earlier state", the state where p2 is in l2_2 is after being in l2_1. Wait, no. If p2 is in l2_1 at some state, then before that state, there must have been a state where either p1 is in l1_3 or p2 is in l2_2. But if p2 is moved from l2_1 to l2_2 later, then the state where p2 is in l2_2 is after the state where it was in l2_1, which can't be. So this is a problem. Therefore, we need to make sure that before p2 arrives in l2_1, either p1 is in l1_3 or p2 is in l2_2. But since the goal requires p2 to be in l2_2, maybe we can have p2 go to l2_2 first, then to l2_1, but that would conflict with the goal. Hmm.

Wait, the constraint is: If in some state, p2 is in l2_1, then there must be an earlier state where p1 is in l1_3 or p2 is in l2_2. So if p2 is in l2_1 at some point, then before that, p1 must have been in l1_3 or p2 in l2_2. But in our current plan, when we fly p2 to l2_1, we need to ensure that before that, either p1 was in l1_3 or p2 was in l2_2. How can we do that?

Alternatively, maybe during the transportation of p1, we can have it pass through l1_3. For example, if in c1, after a1 flies p2 to l2_1, the truck t1 could drive through l1_3 on the way to l1_5. Wait, but t1 starts in l1_4. To get to l1_1 (airport), it might need to go through l1_3 if the cities are connected. But the problem statement doesn't specify the connectivity between locations. The actions for driving trucks only require that the locations are in the same city, but the truck can move between any two locations in the same city. So perhaps the truck can go directly from l1_4 to l1_1, but if the city's locations are connected in a way that allows that. Since the problem doesn't specify, we can assume that any location in the same city is reachable via a direct drive.

But to satisfy the constraint, perhaps when moving p1 from the airport l1_1 to l1_5, we have to go through l1_3. Let's say:

After flying p1 to l1_1, load into t1. Then drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_3, then to l1_5. That way, p1 is in l1_3 in between. But this would add steps. However, the plan must be optimal (shortest possible). Adding extra steps would make it longer, so maybe there's another way.

Alternatively, maybe when moving p2, we can have it go through l2_2 before going to l2_1. But the goal is for p2 to end up in l2_2. So if we first take p2 to l2_2, then move it to l2_1, then back to l2_2. But that would add steps, making the plan longer. But the constraints require that if p2 is in l2_1, then before that, either p1 was in l1_3 or p2 was in l2_2. So if we first move p2 to l2_2 (satisfying the goal), then move it to l2_1 (but then we have to move it back to l2_2 again). But that's not optimal. So perhaps there's a better way.

Wait, maybe the constraint can be satisfied by having p2 in l2_2 before being moved to l2_1. For example, if p2 is first delivered to l2_2 (achieving the goal), but then moved to l2_1 again. But then the goal would not be satisfied. So that's not acceptable. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe during the transportation of p2, we have to pass through l2_2. But how?

Wait, p2 starts in l1_4 (c1). To get to c2, it needs to be flown to l2_1. Then driven to l2_2. So during that process, after being in l2_1, it's driven to l2_2. So the constraint that when p2 is in l2_1, there must have been an earlier state where p2 was in l2_2 can't happen because the first time p2 is in l2_1 is before going to l2_2. Therefore, that approach doesn't satisfy the constraint. So this is a problem.

Wait, perhaps the constraint is that whenever p2 is in l2_1, there must have been a previous state where either p1 was in l1_3 or p2 was in l2_2. Since the final goal is p2 in l2_2, maybe during the plan, p2 is first taken to l2_2 (satisfying the goal), but then moved to l2_1 for some reason, and then back. But that would make the plan longer. Alternatively, maybe we can have p1 pass through l1_3 during its transportation. Let's think.

For p1's journey: from l2_3 to l2_1 (via truck), then to l1_1 (via airplane), then to l1_5 (via truck). If the truck in c1 (t1) drives from l1_4 to l1_1 (to pick up p1), then from l1_1 to l1_5. But if the city's locations allow, could t1 drive from l1_4 to l1_3 to l1_1 to l1_5? If that's possible, then loading p1 into t1 at l1_1, then driving to l1_3 (unloading?), but that's not needed. Wait, but if we drive t1 through l1_3 on the way to l1_5, then p1 would be in l1_3 during that time. For example:

After loading p1 into t1 at l1_1, drive t1 to l1_3, then to l1_5. So during the drive from l1_1 to l1_3, p1 is in the truck, and when the truck arrives at l1_3, the package is there. Then the truck drives to l1_5, unloading there. This way, p1 is in l1_3 at some state. So if during the time when p2 is being moved to l2_1 (c2's airport), we have already had p1 in l1_3, that would satisfy the constraint.

So let's adjust the plan for p1:

1. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1 (wait, no: a2 is in l2_1 initially. To fly to l1_1, which is in c1. So flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1. Then unload p1 from a2 into l1_1. Then truck t1 (which is in l1_4) drives to l1_1, loads p1, then drives to l1_3, then to l1_5. But that adds steps. But this way, when p1 is in l1_3 (after the truck arrives there), that's a state where p1 is in l1_3, which would satisfy the constraint for when p2 is in l2_1. Because when p2 is unloaded into l2_1 (from airplane a1), that's after p1 has been in l1_3.

Wait, but the order matters. Let's outline the steps:

Possible sequence:

For p1:

- In c2: t2 drives from l2_1 to l2_3 (load p1), drive back to l2_1, load into a2, fly to l1_1.

For p2:

- In c1: t1 drives from l1_4 to l1_1 (load p2), load into a1, fly to l2_1. Then t2 drives to l2_2.

But let's interleave the steps.

But let's think step by step.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Move p1 from l2_3 to l2_1 via truck t2.

   a. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2 (t2 moves to l2_3)
   b. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
   c. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
   d. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
   e. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
   f. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
   g. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
   h. Now, in c1, need to move p1 to l1_5. t1 is in l1_4.

   i. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
   j. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
   k. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
   l. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5

For p2:

   m. In c1: t1 is initially in l1_4, which is where p2 is. So:

   n. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (but after step i, t1 is moved to l1_1. Wait, no: the steps for p1 require t1 to be moved from l1_4 to l1_1 in step i. So before that, can we load p2 into t1?

   Wait, the initial state: p2 is in l1_4. t1 is in l1_4. So before moving t1, we can load p2 into t1. Then drive t1 to l1_1, unload p2 there, then load into a1, fly to l2_1, unload into t2, drive to l2_2.

But the steps for p1 require t1 to be in l1_4 initially. So:

Possible order:

For p2:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (since both are there)
2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 (carrying p2)
3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (now p2 is in l1_1)
4. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (a1 is there)
5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (a1 flies to c2's airport)
6. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (p2 is now in l2_1)
7. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (t2 is in l2_1)
8. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
9. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (goal achieved)

But this sequence for p2 would have p2 in l2_1 at step 6. The constraint says that whenever p2 is in l2_1, there must be an earlier state where p1 is in l1_3 or p2 is in l2_2. But in this case, when p2 is in l2_1 (step 6), the previous steps for p1 might not have happened yet. Let's see the order of steps.

If we process p2's steps first:

But we need to interleave the steps for p1 and p2. Let's think about the order.

If we first handle p2:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 (p2 is in t1)
3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
4. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
6. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (now p2 is in l2_1)

At this point, we have to satisfy the constraint that if p2 is in l2_1 (step 6), then there must be an earlier state where p1 was in l1_3 or p2 was in l2_2. But up to step 6, p2 hasn't been to l2_2 yet (that's the next steps). So to satisfy this, we need to have p1 in l1_3 before step 6.

But p1's steps would be:

7. For p1, start in l2_3. So:

7. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
8. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
9. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
10. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
11. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
12. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
13. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
14. drivetruck t1 (which is in l1_1 after step 3) to l1_5?

Wait, after step 3, t1 is in l1_1, unloaded. So for p1, after step 13, p1 is in l1_1. Then:

14. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
15. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
16. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5

But in this case, when does p1 get to l1_3? Unless we make the truck drive through l1_3. So modifying step 15 to drive from l1_1 to l1_3, then to l1_5:

15. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
16. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_5 c1
17. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5

In this case, p1 is in l1_3 when the truck arrives there (step 15), which is after step 6 (p2 is in l2_1). So the state where p2 is in l2_1 (step 6) occurs before p1 is in l1_3 (step 15). So this would violate the constraint, because step 6 (p2 in l2_1) requires an earlier state where p1 is in l1_3 or p2 in l2_2. But in this order, p2 is in l2_1 at step 6, and p1 reaches l1_3 at step 15, which is after step 6. So the constraint is not satisfied.

Hmm. This is tricky. So perhaps we need to adjust the order of steps so that p1 reaches l1_3 before p2 is in l2_1.

Let's try to interleave the steps:

For p2:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 (carrying p2)
3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (p2 in l1_1)
4. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (p2 arrives in l2_1 at step 5)

For p1:

6. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2 (t2 was in l2_1 initially)
7. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
8. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
9. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (p1 in l2_1)
10. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
11. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (p1 arrives in l1_1)
12. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
13. drivetruck t1 (now in l1_1 after step 3) to l1_3
14. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (wait, no. After step 3, t1 is in l1_1, but after step 13, t1 would have driven to l1_3. So need to load p1 into t1 before driving.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let's outline the steps again with proper ordering.

Alternative approach:

Let's first handle p1's transportation up to the point where p1 is in l1_3, then handle p2's steps that require p2 to be in l2_1, ensuring that the constraint is met.

But how?

Alternatively, maybe the order should be:

- First move p1 to l1_3 (using truck t1), but p1 is in c2. So that's not possible. Hmm.

Wait, p1 is in l2_3 (c2). To get to l1_5 (c1), it must go through c2's airport l2_1, then fly to c1's airport l1_1, then via truck.

So perhaps during the movement of p1, after it's loaded into the airplane in l2_1, flown to l1_1, and then transported via truck through l1_3 to l1_5. So:

Steps for p1:

1. t2 drives from l2_1 to l2_3 (load p1)
2. load p1 into t2
3. drive t2 back to l2_1
4. unload p1 into a2
5. fly a2 to l1_1
6. unload p1 into l1_1
7. t1 drives from l1_4 to l1_1 (now empty)
8. load p1 into t1
9. drive t1 to l1_3 (so p1 is in l1_3)
10. drive t1 to l1_5
11. unload p1.

Now, during this process, step 9 puts p1 in l1_3. 

Now, for p2:

a. load p2 into t1 at l1_4 (but t1 is moving to l1_1 for p1's transportation). So perhaps:

But initially, t1 is in l1_4. So steps for p2:

a. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (at the same time as p1's steps?)

But if we first handle p2's loading before moving t1:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 (carrying both p2 and later p1? No, can't carry both unless loaded together. Wait, no. Each load/unload is for a single package.

Wait, in the initial state, t1 is in l1_4, and p2 is in l1_4. So first, we can load p2 into t1, then drive t1 to l1_1.

Then unload p2 in l1_1, load into a1, fly to l2_1.

But during this time, t1 is being used for p2's transportation, so for p1's transportation, we need t1 to be available again.

This is getting very tangled. Perhaps the optimal plan requires interleaving the steps for p1 and p2 to satisfy the constraints.

Let me try to outline a possible plan step by step, ensuring all constraints are met.

First, let's handle p2's constraints:

- Must be in l2_1 at some state. Let's say during transportation, p2 is unloaded at l2_1.
- Must be in l1_1 at some state. Which would happen when it's loaded onto airplane a1 in l1_1 and flown to l2_1.
- Also, the constraint that if p2 is in l1_1, then at that state or after, either p1 is in l1_4 or l2_1. Hmm. Wait, the constraint is: if p2 is in l1_1, then in that state or after, either p1 is in l1_4 or l2_1.

Wait, the actual constraint is:

"If expression "Package p2 is in location l1_1" holds in some state s, then expression "At least one of the following conditions is true: "Package p1 is in location l1_4", "Package p1 is in location l2_1"" must hold at s or at some state after s."

So when p2 is in l1_1 (during its transportation), we need to ensure that either p1 is in l1_4 or l2_1 at that time or later.

p1 starts in l2_3. If p2 is in l1_1 during step when it's loaded into a1, then at that time, p1 is still in l2_3. So we need to ensure that after p2 is in l1_1, p1 is moved to l2_1 or l1_4.

But p1's path is to go from l2_3 to l2_1 (via truck), then to l1_1 (via airplane), then to l1_5. So after p2 is in l1_1 (when p2 is loaded into a1), p1 would later be in l2_1 (when it's loaded into a2). So that would satisfy the constraint, because after p2 is in l1_1, p1 is moved to l2_1 (when it's loaded into a2 there). So that's okay.

Now, let's outline the steps:

For p2:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (both are here)
2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (now p2 is in l1_1)
4. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
6. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (now p2 is in l2_1)
7. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (t2 is here)
8. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
9. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (goal achieved)

For p1:

A. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2 (step A comes before step 7, since t2 is used for p2 later)
B. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
C. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
D. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
E. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
F. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
G. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (now p1 is in l1_1)
H. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1 (t1 is in l1_1 after step 3)
I. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
J. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
K. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 (goal achieved)

But wait, the order of steps matters. Let's sequence them properly:

Order of steps:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
4. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
6. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (p2 in l2_1)
7. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2 (for p1)
8. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
9. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
10. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
11. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
12. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
13. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (p1 in l1_1)
14. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1 (but t1 is in l1_1 after step 2)
15. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
16. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
17. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
18. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (after step 10, t2 is back in l2_1)
19. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
20. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

But wait, step 7 (drivetruck t2 to l2_3) is before step 18. So after step 9, t2 is back in l2_1. Then steps 11-17 for p1, then steps 18-20 for p2.

But this sequence has p2 being loaded into t2 after p1's steps. But in step 18, t2 is in l2_1, so possible.

Now, checking constraints:

1. p2 must be in l2_1 at some state. Step 6.

At step 6, p2 is in l2_1. The constraint says that there must be an earlier state where p1 is in l1_3 or p2 in l2_2. Before step 6, the steps are 1-5. At that point, has p1 been in l1_3 or p2 in l2_2? No. So this violates the constraint.

Thus, this plan is invalid.

So we need to ensure that before p2 is in l2_1 (step 6), there's a state where p1 is in l1_3 or p2 is in l2_2.

To satisfy this, perhaps p2 needs to pass through l2_2 before being in l2_1. But how? Since the goal is l2_2, perhaps we first take p2 to l2_2, then to l2_1, then back to l2_2. But that's three steps, making the plan longer.

Alternatively, maybe during p1's transportation, we can have it in l1_3 before p2 is in l2_1.

But p1's path is l2_3 -> l2_1 -> l1_1 -> l1_5. To get to l1_3, the truck in c1 (t1) needs to go through there. But t1 is used for p2's transportation first.

Let's adjust the plan:

After handling p2's movement to l2_1 (step 6), we have to ensure that before that, p1 was in l1_3. But p1 is in c2's l2_3. So impossible unless p1 is moved to l1_3, which is in c1. That can't happen until p1 is flown to c1.

Wait, this is getting too complicated. Maybe the optimal plan involves moving p2 to l2_1 after p1 has been moved to l1_3.

Alternatively, perhaps during p1's journey through c1, after being flown to l1_1, the truck t1 takes a detour through l1_3 to l1_5. For example:

After unloading p1 from a2 at l1_1 (step 13), load into t1, drive to l1_3 (step 14), then to l1_5. This way, p1 is in l1_3 at step 14.

But step 6 (p2 in l2_1) occurs before step 14. So the constraint that when p2 is in l2_1 (step 6), there must be an earlier state where p1 is in l1_3 or p2 in l2_2. But p1 hasn't reached l1_3 yet. So this doesn't satisfy the constraint.

Hmm. This suggests that the initial plan is invalid due to the constraint.

Alternative approach: Let's have p2 go to l2_1 after p1 has been in l1_3. But p2 is in c1 initially. So how?

Alternatively, maybe the constraint can be satisfied by having p2 pass through l2_2 before being in l2_1. For example:

For p2:

- Drive to l2_2 first, then to l2_1, but how? Because p2 is in c1 initially. So p2 needs to be flown to c2's airport (l2_1), then driven to l2_2. But in that case, p2 is in l2_1 first, then l2_2. So when p2 is in l2_1 (step 6), there's no earlier state where p2 is in l2_2. So that doesn't help. Unless we first take p2 to l2_2 via another route, which isn't possible since p2 starts in c1.

Another idea: Use the airplane a2 to carry p2 from c1 to c2. Wait, no, p2 is in c1's l1_4. To fly p2 to c2's l2_1, we can use airplane a1 which is in l1_1.

So steps for p2:

1. load into t1 at l1_4.
2. drive to l1_1.
3. unload into a1.
4. fly to l2_1.
5. unload into t2.
6. drive to l2_2.

But during this process, when p2 is in l2_1 (step 5), the constraint requires that before that, p1 was in l1_3 or p2 was in l2_2. But p2 hasn't been to l2_2 yet. So unless p1 was in l1_3 before step 5.

But p1 is in c2's l2_3. To get to l1_3, p1 needs to be flown to c1. So if we first move p1 to c1 and then to l1_3 before moving p2 to l2_1, that would work.

Let's outline:

For p1:

1. In c2, truck t2 drives to l2_3, loads p1, drives back to l2_1, loads into a2, flies to l1_1.

For p1's steps:

a. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
b. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
c. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
d. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
e. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
f. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
g. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
h. Now, truck t1 (which was used for p2) is in l1_1. So drive t1 to l1_3:
i. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
j. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (wait, but p1 is in l1_1. So after step g, p1 is in l1_1. Then, we need to load it into t1:

i. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 (but t1 was used for p2 earlier, so this might not be possible. Wait, initial state t1 is in l1_4. For p2's steps, we need to use t1 to move p2 to l1_1.

So interleaving steps:

For p2:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
4. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
6. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
7. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
8. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
9. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

For p1:

a. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2 (before step 7)
b. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
c. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
d. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
e. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
f. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
g. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (now p1 is in l1_1)
h. drivetruck t1 (which is in l1_1 after step 3) to l1_3:
i. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
j. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (but p1 is in l1_1. Need to first load into t1.)

Wait, after step g, p1 is in l1_1. So steps for p1 after g:

h. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (t1 is in l1_1 after step 3)
i. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1 (now p1 is in l1_3)
j. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (now p1 is in l1_3)
k. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_5 c1
l. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (wait, but we unloaded it there. So perhaps after unloading in l1_3, we need to reload and drive to l1_5. But this adds steps.

This is getting too long, which would violate the optimality condition. The plan needs to be as short as possible.

Alternatively, after step g (p1 in l1_1), load into t1, drive to l1_5 directly:

h. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
i. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
j. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5

But this way, p1 never passes through l1_3, so the constraint when p2 is in l2_1 (step 6) isn't met.

Thus, this plan is invalid.

I'm stuck. Let's think differently. What if we use airplane a2 to carry p2 from l1_1 to l2_1, but in the process, make sure that p1 is in l1_3 before p2 arrives in l2_1.

But p1 starts in c2. To get to l1_3, p1 must first fly to c1's airport l1_1, then be driven to l1_3.

So steps:

For p1:

1. t2 drives from l2_1 to l2_3, loads p1, drives back to l2_1, unloads.
2. load into a2, fly to l1_1.
3. unload into l1_1.
4. load into t1, drive to l1_3, unload.
5. Then drive to l1_5.

For p2:

1. load into t1 at l1_4, drive to l1_1, unload.
2. load into a1, fly to l2_1.
3. unload into t2, drive to l2_2.

Now, when does p2 arrive in l2_1? After step 3 for p2. But p1's step 4 (unload into l1_3) is after p2's step 3. So p2 is in l2_1 (step 3) before p1 is in l1_3 (step 4), so the constraint is not met.

To fix this, we need to have p1 in l1_3 before p2 is in l2_1.

So reordering steps:

For p1:

1. t2 drives to l2_3, load p1, drive back to l2_1, unload.
2. load into a2, fly to l1_1.
3. unload into l1_1.
4. load into t1, drive to l1_3, unload.
5. drive to l1_5.

For p2:

a. load into t1 at l1_4, drive to l1_1, unload.
b. load into a1, fly to l2_1.
c. unload into t2, drive to l2_2.

But to have p1 in l1_3 before p2 is in l2_1, we need to complete steps 1-4 for p1 before step b of p2.

But in step a for p2, t1 is used to drive p2 to l1_1. After that, t1 is available to carry p1. So the steps would be:

Order:

1. p2: load into t1, drive to l1_1, unload.
2. p1: t2 drives to l2_3, load p1, drive back, unload.
3. p1: load into a2, fly to l1_1.
4. p1: unload into l1_1.
5. p1: load into t1, drive to l1_3, unload.
6. p1: drive to l1_5, unload.
7. p2: load into a1, fly to l2_1.
8. p2: unload into t2, drive to l2_2, unload.

But this way, p2 is loaded into a1 (step 7) after p1 has been moved to l1_3 (step 5). Then when p2 arrives in l2_1 (step 8), the earlier state where p1 was in l1_3 (step 5) satisfies the constraint.

But also, during step 7 (fly a1 to l2_1), p2 is in l2_1. So step 8 would be unload, making p2 in l2_1. The constraint requires that if p2 is in l2_1, then there must be an earlier state where p1 was in l1_3 or p2 in l2_2. In this case, p1 was in l1_3 (step 5) before p2 arrives in l2_1 (step 8). So the constraint is satisfied.

Now, checking other constraints:

- p2 must be in l2_4 or l1_2 at some state. The current plan doesn't do that. So this is a problem.

Another constraint: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "At least one of the following conditions is true: "Package p2 is in location l2_4", "Package p2 is in location l1_2".

So during the plan, p2 must pass through either l2_4 or l1_2.

In our current plan, p2's path is l1_4 -> l1_1 -> l2_1 -> l2_2. So it doesn't go through l2_4 or l1_2. So this violates the constraint. Thus, we need to adjust the plan to include one of those locations.

Option: Have p2 pass through l2_4. How? After being unloaded in l2_1, drive t2 to l2_4, then to l2_2. But that adds steps.

Steps for p2 after arriving in l2_1:

7. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
8. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
9. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (satisfies the constraint)
10. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
11. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2
12. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

But this adds steps 8-11, making the plan longer. Is there a shorter way?

Alternatively, if p2 can be moved to l1_2 during its journey. Since p2 starts in l1_4 (c1), can we drive t1 through l1_2 on the way to l1_1?

For example:

For p2's steps:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1 (passing through l1_2)
3. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
4. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
5. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
6. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
7. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
8. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
9. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
10. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

In this case, when t1 drives from l1_4 to l1_2 to l1_1, p2 is in l1_2 (step 2). This satisfies the constraint that p2 is in l1_2 at some state.

Now, checking all constraints:

1. p2 must be in l2_1 (step 7): yes.
   - Before that, p1 must have been in l1_3 or p2 in l2_2. In this plan, p1's steps would have p1 in l1_3 before p2 is in l2_1. For example:

For p1:

a. t2 drives to l2_3, loads p1, drives back to l2_1.
b. load into a2, fly to l1_1.
c. unload into l1_1.
d. load into t1 (which is now in l1_1 after step 3), drive to l1_3, unload.
e. drive to l1_5.

So p1 is in l1_3 (step d) before p2 arrives in l2_1 (step 7). So the constraint is satisfied.

Other constraints:

- p2 must be in l1_1 (step 4): yes. When p2 is in l1_1, we need to ensure that at that state or after, p1 is in l1_4 or l2_1. 

At step 4, p2 is in l1_1. At this point, p1 is still in l2_3 (hasn't been moved yet). So after this state, p1 is moved to l2_1 (step a.b), which is l2_1. So the constraint is satisfied because after p2 is in l1_1, p1 is in l2_1.

- The constraint that p2 must be in l1_1 is already covered.

- The constraint that p2 must be in l2_4 or l1_2 is satisfied by step 2 (p2 in l1_2).

So this plan seems to meet all constraints.

Now, let's outline the full plan:

Steps for p2:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1
3. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
4. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
5. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
6. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
7. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
8. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
9. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
10. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

Steps for p1:

a. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2 (before step 8)
b. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
c. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
d. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
e. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
f. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
g. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (p1 in l1_1)
h. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (t1 is in l1_1 after step 3)
i. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
j. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
k. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_5 c1
l. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5

But need to order these steps properly, ensuring that t2 is available for both p1 and p2.

Final ordered plan:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1
3. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
4. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
5. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
6. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
7. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
8. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
9. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
10. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
11. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
12. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
13. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
14. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
15. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
16. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
17. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
18. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_5 c1
19. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
20. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
21. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
22. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

But steps 20-22 are after step 11. However, after step 11, t2 is in l2_1, so steps 20-22 can be done. But between steps 11 and 20, t2 is used for other actions? No, steps 8-11 use t2 for p1's transportation. After step 11, t2 is in l2_1 and available.

But step 20 comes after step 19. So the correct order would be:

After step 7 (p2 in l2_1), steps 8-11 for p1:

8. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
9. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
10. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
11. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
12. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
13. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
14. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
15. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
16. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
17. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
18. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_5 c1
19. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
20. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (t2 is in l2_1 after step 10)
21. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
22. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

This way, all steps are ordered correctly.

Now, checking constraints:

- p2 is in l2_1 (step 7). Before that, in step 3, p2 is in l1_1, and steps for p1 haven't started yet. So to satisfy the constraint that when p2 is in l2_1 (step 7), there must be an earlier state where p1 is in l1_3 or p2 in l2_2. But p1 hasn't been moved to l1_3 yet (step 17). So this is a problem.

This suggests that the current plan doesn't satisfy the constraint for p2 being in l2_1 at step 7. The earlier states (steps 1-7) do not have p1 in l1_3 or p2 in l2_2. Thus, this plan is invalid.

I'm really struggling with this constraint. Let's try a different approach: perhaps p2 needs to visit l2_2 before being in l2_1. But how? Since p2 is moving from c1 to c2's l2_2, but to visit l2_2 before l2_1 isn't possible unless we take a different route.

Alternatively, maybe use a different airplane or truck, but the constraints are tight.

Another idea: Use the airplane a2 to carry p2 from l2_1 to l2_2, but that's not possible since airplanes can only fly between airports. l2_2 is not an airport (only l2_1 is in c2).

Thus, the only way to move p2 from l2_1 to l2_2 is via truck t2.

Given all the constraints, perhaps the minimal valid plan is as follows, incorporating all the required steps and satisfying all constraints:

```
```
1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1
3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
4. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
5. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
6. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
7. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
8. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
9. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
10. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
11. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
12. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
13. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
14. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
15. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
16. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
17. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
18. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
19. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
20. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
21. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_5 c1
22. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
```

But this plan has p2 in l2_1 at step 7. Before that, p1 is not in l1_3 and p2 is not in l2_2. So step 7 violates the constraint. 

Alternatively, after step 7, we have to ensure that p1 is in l1_3 before step 7. But p1's steps start after p2's steps. This seems impossible.

Given the time I've spent and the complexity, I think the optimal plan involves moving p1 through l1_3 and p2 through l2_1 and l2_2, with the necessary steps to satisfy the constraints. The final plan would look something like:

```
```
1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
4. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
6. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
7. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
8. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
9. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
10. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
11. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
12. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
13. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
14. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
15. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
16. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
17. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
18. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
19. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
20. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
21. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
22. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
23. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
24. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_5 c1
25. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
```

This plan includes p2 passing through l2_4 (step 9), satisfying the third constraint. p2 is in l2_1 at step 6, and before that, p2 was not in l2_2 and p1 wasn't in l1_3. So this plan still violates the first constraint.

I think I'm missing something. Let's try to satisfy all constraints with the following steps:

1. Move p2 to l1_1 via truck, then to l2_1 via airplane, then to l2_2 via truck. This covers p2 in l2_1 and l2_2.

2. Move p1 via truck to l2_1, airplane to l1_1, truck to l1_3, then to l1_5. This covers p1 in l1_3.

3. Ensure p2 is in l2_1 after p1 is in l1_3.

But how to order the steps.

Final attempt:

Plan:

1. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
2. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
3. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
4. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
5. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
6. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
7. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
8. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
9. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
10. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_5 c1
11. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
12. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
13. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
14. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
15. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
16. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
17. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
18. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
19. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
20. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

This way, when p2 is in l2_1 (step 17), the earlier state where p1 is in l1_3 (step 9) satisfies the constraint. 

Also, p2 is in l1_1 (step 14), which requires that after that, p1 is in l1_4 or l2_1. p1 is in l1_3 (step 9) which isn't one of those. But wait, the constraint says that when p2 is in l1_1 (step 14), then either p1 is in l1_4 or l2_1 at that state or after. At step 14, p1 is in l1_1 (after step 6). After that, p1 is moved to l1_3 (step 9). So this does not satisfy the constraint. 

This suggests that the plan is still invalid.

Given the time I've spent and the complexity, I think the correct plan requires careful step ordering and checking each constraint. The final valid plan would look like the following, ensuring all constraints are met:

```
```
1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1
3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
4. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
5. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
6. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
7. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
8. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
9. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
10. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
11. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
12. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
13. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
14. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
15. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
16. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
17. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
18. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_5 c1
19. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
20. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
21. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
22. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
```

This plan satisfies:

- p2 is in l2_1 (step 7). Before that, p1 hasn't been to l1_3 yet, but p2 was in l1_2 (step 3), which doesn't satisfy the first constraint. 

I think I've exhausted my options. The correct plan must involve p2 passing through l2_1 after p1 has been in l1_3, and include the necessary intermediate steps. Given the time I've spent, I'll present the plan that satisfies most constraints, even if I'm not fully confident.
