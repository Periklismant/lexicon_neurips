Let me understand the problem first:

1. **Initial State**:
   - We have cities c1 and c2.
   - City c1 has locations l1_1 (which is an airport), l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, and l1_5.
   - City c2 has locations l2_1 (which is an airport), l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, and l2_5.
   - Truck t1 is in location l1_4, and truck t2 is in location l2_1.
   - Package p1 is in location l2_3, and package p2 is in location l1_4.
   - Airplane a1 is in location l1_1, and airplane a2 is in location l2_1.

2. **Goal**:
   - Package p1 should be in location l1_5.
   - Package p2 should be in location l2_2.

3. **Constraints**:
   - C1: Package p2 must be in location l2_1 at some point.
   - C2: If p2 is in l2_1, then before that, either p1 should be in l1_3 or p2 should be in l2_2.
   - C3: Either p2 should be in l2_4 or p2 should be in l1_2 at some point.
   - C4: Package p2 must be in location l1_1 at some point.
   - C5: If p2 is in l1_1, then at that state or after, either p1 should be in l1_4 or p1 should be in l2_1.

Now, let's develop a plan:

First, let's consider what we need to achieve and the constraints imposed on our plan.

1. The goal is to get:
   - p1 to l1_5 (it's currently in l2_3)
   - p2 to l2_2 (it's currently in l1_4)

2. Constraints require that p2 must visit specific locations during its journey:
   - p2 must visit l2_1
   - Before p2 visits l2_1, either p1 is in l1_3 or p2 is in l2_2
   - p2 must visit either l2_4 or l1_2
   - p2 must visit l1_1
   - When or after p2 is in l1_1, p1 must be in l1_4 or l2_1

Let's try to sketch out a high-level plan considering these constraints:

1. For p1 (currently in l2_3, needs to go to l1_5):
   - We need to use a truck to move it from l2_3 to l2_1 (the airport in c2).
   - Then fly it using an airplane to l1_1 (the airport in c1).
   - Then use a truck to move it from l1_1 to l1_5.
   - Depending on the constraints, we might need to make a detour through l1_3, l1_4, or l2_1.

2. For p2 (currently in l1_4, needs to go to l2_2):
   - We need to use a truck to move it from l1_4 to l1_1 (the airport in c1). [This satisfies C4]
   - Then fly it using an airplane to l2_1 (the airport in c2). [This satisfies C1]
   - Then use a truck to move it from l2_1 to l2_2 (the goal).
   - Depending on the constraints, we might need to make a detour through l2_4 or l1_2 to satisfy C3.

Let's see how to satisfy the constraints:

- C2: Before p2 is in l2_1, either p1 is in l1_3 or p2 is in l2_2.
  - We can plan for p1 to be in l1_3 before p2 reaches l2_1.

- C5: When or after p2 is in l1_1, p1 should be in l1_4 or l2_1.
  - We can plan for p1 to be in l1_4 when or after p2 is in l1_1. Since both packages are moving, we need to coordinate their movements.

Now, let's refine our plan:

1. For p1 (currently in l2_3, needs to go to l1_5):
   - Move t2 to l2_3
   - Load p1 onto t2
   - Drive t2 to l2_1 (airport)
   - Unload p1 from t2
   - Load p1 onto a2
   - Fly a2 to l1_1
   - Unload p1 from a2
   - Move t1 to l1_1
   - Load p1 onto t1
   - Drive t1 to l1_3 (to satisfy C2 before p2 reaches l2_1)
   - Drive t1 to l1_4 (to satisfy C5 after p2 is in l1_1)
   - Drive t1 to l1_5
   - Unload p1 from t1

2. For p2 (currently in l1_4, needs to go to l2_2):
   - Move t1 to l1_4
   - Load p2 onto t1
   - Drive t1 to l1_2 (to satisfy C3)
   - Drive t1 to l1_1 (to satisfy C4)
   - Unload p2 from t1
   - Load p2 onto a1
   - Fly a1 to l2_1 (to satisfy C1)
   - Unload p2 from a1
   - Move t2 to l2_1
   - Load p2 onto t2
   - Drive t2 to l2_2
   - Unload p2 from t2

But there's a constraint that says, "Before p2 is in l2_1, either p1 is in l1_3 or p2 is in l2_2." Since p2 is initially not in l2_2, we need to ensure p1 is in l1_3 before p2 reaches l2_1. So, we need to coordinate the movements of the two packages.

Let's try to outline a more detailed sequence of actions to meet all the constraints, ensuring the order of operations:

1. First, we'll focus on moving p1 from l2_3 to l1_3 to satisfy C2 before p2 reaches l2_1:
   - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
   - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
   - drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
   - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
   - loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
   - flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
   - unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
   - drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
   - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
   - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1 (p1 is now in l1_3, satisfying part of C2)

2. Now, we'll move p2 to visit the necessary locations and eventually reach l2_2:
   - drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1
   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
   - drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1 (to satisfy C3)
   - drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
   - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (to satisfy C4)

3. At this point, p2 is in l1_1, so we need to ensure that p1 is in either l1_4 or l2_1 at or after this state to satisfy C5:
   - Wait, p1 is in the truck t1, which is in l1_1. Let's continue the plan.
   - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
   - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4 (p1 is now in l1_4, satisfying C5 after p2 was in l1_1)

4. Continuing with moving p2 to its goal:
   - loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
   - flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
   - unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (to satisfy C1)
   - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
   - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
   - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
   - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (p2 reaches its goal)

5. Finally, move p1 to its goal:
   - drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1
   - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
   - drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1
   - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 (p1 reaches its goal)

But wait, there's an issue with the above plan. I'm trying to coordinate the movements of two packages with two trucks, and sometimes I'm assuming the trucks are in places they aren't. Let me reconsider and plan more carefully.

Let's start by clearly mapping out the initial locations and the goal locations:

Initial Locations:
- p1 in l2_3
- p2 in l1_4
- t1 in l1_4
- t2 in l2_1
- a1 in l1_1
- a2 in l2_1

Goal Locations:
- p1 in l1_5
- p2 in l2_2

Let's reconstruct the plan step by step:

1. First, let's move p1 from l2_3 to l1_3 to satisfy C2 before p2 reaches l2_1:
   - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
   - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
   - drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
   - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
   - loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
   - flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
   - unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
   - (We need t1 here, but t1 is in l1_4)
   - drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
   - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
   - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1 (p1 is now in l1_3, satisfying part of C2)

2. Now, let's move p2 from l1_4 to l1_1:
   - (We need t1 here, but t1 is in l1_3 from the previous step)
   - drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1
   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
   - drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1 (to satisfy C3)
   - drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
   - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (to satisfy C4)

3. At this point, p2 is in l1_1 and p1 is in the truck t1, which is also in l1_1. We need to ensure p1 is in l1_4 or l2_1 to satisfy C5:
   - (We can't immediately move t1 to l1_4 because it's holding p1)
   - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
   - loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
   - flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
   - unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 (p1 is now in l2_1, satisfying C5 after p2 was in l1_1)

4. Continuing with moving p2 from l1_1 to l2_2:
   - (We've moved a1 to l2_1, so we'll use a2 to transport p2)
   - loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
   - flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
   - unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (to satisfy C1)
   - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
   - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
   - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (p2 reaches its goal)

5. Finally, move p1 from l2_1 to l1_5:
   - (We can use t2 as it's just dropped off p2 in l2_2)
   - drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
   - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
   - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_1 c2 (airport)
   - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
   - (We'll use a1 as it's still in l2_1)
   - loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
   - flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
   - unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
   - (We can use t1, which is still in l1_1)
   - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
   - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
   - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 (p1 reaches its goal)

But I'm noticing an issue. In step 3, after p2 is in l1_1, I move p1 to l2_1 to satisfy C5. However, this means p1 is already in l2_1 while p2 is still in l1_1, and C2 requires that before p2 is in l2_1, either p1 should be in l1_3 or p2 should be in l2_2. Since p1 is already in l2_1 (not l1_3) and p2 hasn't reached l2_2 yet, this breaks C2.

Let me rethink the plan to ensure all constraints are satisfied.

I think there's a misunderstanding in my interpretation of C2. C2 says:
"If p2 is in l2_1, then there must be an earlier state in which either p1 is in l1_3 or p2 is in l2_2."

This means that before p2 reaches l2_1, there should be a state where either p1 is in l1_3 or p2 is in l2_2. So, I need to ensure p1 visits l1_3 before p2 reaches l2_1.

Let me revise the plan:

1. First, move p1 from l2_3 to l1_3 to satisfy C2 before p2 reaches l2_1:
   - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
   - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
   - drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
   - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
   - loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
   - flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
   - unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
   - drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
   - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
   - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1 (p1 is now in l1_3, satisfying part of C2)

2. Now, let's move p2 from l1_4 to l2_1:
   - (We need t1, but t1 is in l1_3 with p1 still inside)
   - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (p1 is now in l1_3, clearly satisfying part of C2)
   - drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1
   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
   - drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1 (to satisfy C3)
   - drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
   - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (to satisfy C4)

3. At this point, p2 is in l1_1 and p1 is in l1_3. C5 says that when or after p2 is in l1_1, p1 should be in l1_4 or l2_1. So, we need to move p1 to one of these locations:
   - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
   - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
   - drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1
   - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4 (p1 is now in l1_4, satisfying C5 after p2 was in l1_1)

4. Continuing with moving p2 from l1_1 to l2_2:
   - drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
   - loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
   - flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
   - unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (to satisfy C1)
   - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
   - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
   - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (p2 reaches its goal)

5. Finally, move p1 from l1_4 to l1_5:
   - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
   - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
   - drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1
   - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 (p1 reaches its goal)

This plan ensures that p1 is in l1_3 before p2 reaches l2_1 (satisfying C2), p2 visits l1_2 (satisfying C3), p2 visits l1_1 (satisfying C4), and after p2 is in l1_1, p1 is in l1_4 (satisfying C5). Eventually, both packages reach their goals.

Now, let me double-check the precision of this plan. Oh, one moment. I see a problem. In step 3, we are moving p1 from l1_3 to l1_4, but in the sequence as described, t1 isn't going back to pick up p1 from l1_3. Let me adjust that:

3. ... (continuing from step 2):
   - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
   - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
   - drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1
   - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4 (p1 is now in l1_4, satisfying C5 after p2 was in l1_1)

Actually, let me recreate the entire plan with careful attention to the locations of the objects at each step:

Initial Locations:
- p1 in l2_3
- p2 in l1_4
- t1 in l1_4
- t2 in l2_1
- a1 in l1_1
- a2 in l2_1

Plan:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
   - t2 goes from l2_1 to l2_3 to pick up p1
   - Now: p1 in l2_3, p2 in l1_4, t1 in l1_4, t2 in l2_3, a1 in l1_1, a2 in l2_1

2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
   - Load p1 onto t2 in l2_3
   - Now: p1 in t2 (in l2_3), p2 in l1_4, t1 in l1_4, t2 in l2_3, a1 in l1_1, a2 in l2_1

3. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
   - t2, with p1 inside, drives from l2_3 to l2_1 (the airport in c2)
   - Now: p1 in t2 (in l2_1), p2 in l1_4, t1 in l1_4, t2 in l2_1, a1 in l1_1, a2 in l2_1

4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
   - Unload p1 from t2 in l2_1
   - Now: p1 in l2_1, p2 in l1_4, t1 in l1_4, t2 in l2_1, a1 in l1_1, a2 in l2_1

5. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
   - Load p1 onto a2 in l2_1
   - Now: p1 in a2 (in l2_1), p2 in l1_4, t1 in l1_4, t2 in l2_1, a1 in l1_1, a2 in l2_1

6. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
   - a2, with p1 inside, flies from l2_1 to l1_1
   - Now: p1 in a2 (in l1_1), p2 in l1_4, t1 in l1_4, t2 in l2_1, a1 in l1_1, a2 in l1_1

7. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
   - Unload p1 from a2 in l1_1
   - Now: p1 in l1_1, p2 in l1_4, t1 in l1_4, t2 in l2_1, a1 in l1_1, a2 in l1_1

8. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
   - Oops, t1 is in l1_4, but p1 is in l1_1. I need to move t1 first.
   - Corrected: drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
   - Now: p1 in l1_1, p2 in l1_4, t1 in l1_1, t2 in l2_1, a1 in l1_1, a2 in l1_1

9. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
   - Load p1 onto t1 in l1_1
   - Now: p1 in t1 (in l1_1), p2 in l1_4, t1 in l1_1, t2 in l2_1, a1 in l1_1, a2 in l1_1

10. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
    - t1, with p1 inside, drives from l1_1 to l1_3
    - Now: p1 in t1 (in l1_3), p2 in l1_4, t1 in l1_3, t2 in l2_1, a1 in l1_1, a2 in l1_1

11. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
    - Unload p1 from t1 in l1_3 (to satisfy C2)
    - Now: p1 in l1_3, p2 in l1_4, t1 in l1_3, t2 in l2_1, a1 in l1_1, a2 in l1_1

12. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1
    - t1 drives from l1_3 to l1_4 to pick up p2
    - Now: p1 in l1_3, p2 in l1_4, t1 in l1_4, t2 in l2_1, a1 in l1_1, a2 in l1_1

13. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
    - Load p2 onto t1 in l1_4
    - Now: p1 in l1_3, p2 in t1 (in l1_4), t1 in l1_4, t2 in l2_1, a1 in l1_1, a2 in l1_1

14. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1
    - t1, with p2 inside, drives from l1_4 to l1_2 (to satisfy C3)
    - Now: p1 in l1_3, p2 in t1 (in l1_2), t1 in l1_2, t2 in l2_1, a1 in l1_1, a2 in l1_1

15. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
    - t1, with p2 inside, drives from l1_2 to l1_1
    - Now: p1 in l1_3, p2 in t1 (in l1_1), t1 in l1_1, t2 in l2_1, a1 in l1_1, a2 in l1_1

16. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
    - Unload p2 from t1 in l1_1 (to satisfy C4)
    - Now: p1 in l1_3, p2 in l1_1, t1 in l1_1, t2 in l2_1, a1 in l1_1, a2 in l1_1

At this stage, p2 is in l1_1, which satisfies C4. However, C5 requires that when or after p2 is in l1_1, p1 should be in l1_4 or l2_1. But p1 is in l1_3, not in l1_4 or l2_1. So, we need to move p1 to one of these locations.

17. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
    - t1 drives from l1_1 to l1_3 to pick up p1
    - Now: p1 in l1_3, p2 in l1_1, t1 in l1_3, t2 in l2_1, a1 in l1_1, a2 in l1_1

18. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
    - Load p1 onto t1 in l1_3
    - Now: p1 in t1 (in l1_3), p2 in l1_1, t1 in l1_3, t2 in l2_1, a1 in l1_1, a2 in l1_1

19. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1
    - t1, with p1 inside, drives from l1_3 to l1_4
    - Now: p1 in t1 (in l1_4), p2 in l1_1, t1 in l1_4, t2 in l2_1, a1 in l1_1, a2 in l1_1

20. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
    - Unload p1 from t1 in l1_4 (to satisfy C5 after p2 is in l1_1)
    - Now: p1 in l1_4, p2 in l1_1, t1 in l1_4, t2 in l2_1, a1 in l1_1, a2 in l1_1

Now, both C4 and C5 are satisfied. Let's continue with moving p2 to its goal and then p1 to its goal:

21. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
    - t1 drives from l1_4 to l1_1 to pick up p2
    - Now: p1 in l1_4, p2 in l1_1, t1 in l1_1, t2 in l2_1, a1 in l1_1, a2 in l1_1

22. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
    - Load p2 onto a1 in l1_1
    - Now: p1 in l1_4, p2 in a1 (in l1_1), t1 in l1_1, t2 in l2_1, a1 in l1_1, a2 in l1_1

23. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
    - a1, with p2 inside, flies from l1_1 to l2_1
    - Now: p1 in l1_4, p2 in a1 (in l2_1), t1 in l1_1, t2 in l2_1, a1 in l2_1, a2 in l1_1

24. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
    - Unload p2 from a1 in l2_1 (to satisfy C1)
    - Now: p1 in l1_4, p2 in l2_1, t1 in l1_1, t2 in l2_1, a1 in l2_1, a2 in l1_1

25. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
    - Load p2 onto t2 in l2_1
    - Now: p1 in l1_4, p2 in t2 (in l2_1), t1 in l1_1, t2 in l2_1, a1 in l2_1, a2 in l1_1

26. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
    - t2, with p2 inside, drives from l2_1 to l2_2
    - Now: p1 in l1_4, p2 in t2 (in l2_2), t1 in l1_1, t2 in l2_2, a1 in l2_1, a2 in l1_1

27. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
    - Unload p2 from t2 in l2_2 (p2 reaches its goal)
    - Now: p1 in l1_4, p2 in l2_2, t1 in l1_1, t2 in l2_2, a1 in l2_1, a2 in l1_1

28. Finally, let's move p1 from l1_4 to l1_5:
    - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
    - Now: p1 in l1_4, p2 in l2_2, t1 in l1_4, t2 in l2_2, a1 in l2_1, a2 in l1_1

29. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
    - Load p1 onto t1 in l1_4
    - Now: p1 in t1 (in l1_4), p2 in l2_2, t1 in l1_4, t2 in l2_2, a1 in l2_1, a2 in l1_1

30. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1
    - t1, with p1 inside, drives from l1_4 to l1_5
    - Now: p1 in t1 (in l1_5), p2 in l2_2, t1 in l1_5, t2 in l2_2, a1 in l2_1, a2 in l1_1

31. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
    - Unload p1 from t1 in l1_5 (p1 reaches its goal)
    - Now: p1 in l1_5, p2 in l2_2, t1 in l1_5, t2 in l2_2, a1 in l2_1, a2 in l1_1

With this, both p1 and p2 have reached their goals, and all constraints have been satisfied:
- C1: "Package p2 is in location l2_1" is satisfied in step 24.
- C2: "If p2 is in l2_1, then before that, either p1 is in l1_3 or p2 is in l2_2" is satisfied because p1 is in l1_3 in step 11, which is before p2 is in l2_1 in step 24.
- C3: "Either p2 is in l2_4 or p2 is in l1_2" is satisfied because p2 is in l1_2 in step 14.
- C4: "Package p2 is in location l1_1" is satisfied in step 16.
- C5: "If p2 is in l1_1, then at or after that state, either p1 is in l1_4 or p1 is in l2_1" is satisfied because p1 is in l1_4 in step 20, which is after p2 is in l1_1 in step 16.

Let me double-check that we're not missing any action or that there's no issue with the order of actions.

Oh, I see another issue. In step 8, I said "drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1" but t1 is already in l1_4 at this point. But then I contradict myself by saying "Now: p1 in l1_1, p2 in l1_4, t1 in l1_1, t2 in l2_1, a1 in l1_1, a2 in l1_1". This is confusing. Let me fix this by revisiting steps 8 and 9:

8. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
   - t1 drives from l1_4 to l1_1 to pick up p1
   - Now: p1 in l1_1, p2 in l1_4, t1 in l1_1, t2 in l2_1, a1 in l1_1, a2 in l1_1

9. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
   - Load p1 onto t1 in l1_1
   - Now: p1 in t1 (in l1_1), p2 in l1_4, t1 in l1_1, t2 in l2_1, a1 in l1_1, a2 in l1_1

Okay now let me go through the entire plan one more time fixing any errors:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
   - Now: p1 in l2_3, p2 in l1_4, t1 in l1_4, t2 in l2_3, a1 in l1_1, a2 in l2_1

2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
   - Now: p1 in t2 (in l2_3), p2 in l1_4, t1 in l1_4, t2 in l2_3, a1 in l1_1, a2 in l2_1

3. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
   - Now: p1 in t2 (in l2_1), p2 in l1_4, t1 in l1_4, t2 in l2_1, a1 in l1_1, a2 in l2_1

4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
   - Now: p1 in l2_1, p2 in l1_4, t1 in l1_4, t2 in l2_1, a1 in l1_1, a2 in l2_1

5. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
   - Now: p1 in a2 (in l2_1), p2 in l1_4, t1 in l1_4, t2 in l2_1, a1 in l1_1, a2 in l2_1

6. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
   - Now: p1 in a2 (in l1_1), p2 in l1_4, t1 in l1_4, t2 in l2_1, a1 in l1_1, a2 in l1_1

7. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
   - Now: p1 in l1_1, p2 in l1_4, t1 in l1_4, t2 in l2_1, a1 in l1_1, a2 in l1_1

8. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
   - Now: p1 in l1_1, p2 in l1_4, t1 in l1_1, t2 in l2_1, a1 in l1_1, a2 in l1_1

9. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
   - Now: p1 in t1 (in l1_1), p2 in l1_4, t1 in l1_1, t2 in l2_1, a1 in l1_1, a2 in l1_1

10. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
    - Now: p1 in t1 (in l1_3), p2 in l1_4, t1 in l1_3, t2 in l2_1, a1 in l1_1, a2 in l1_1

11. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
    - Now: p1 in l1_3, p2 in l1_4, t1 in l1_3, t2 in l2_1, a1 in l1_1, a2 in l1_1

Now p1 is in l1_3, which will satisfy C2 before p2 is in l2_1.

12. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1
    - Now: p1 in l1_3, p2 in l1_4, t1 in l1_4, t2 in l2_1, a1 in l1_1, a2 in l1_1

13. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
    - Now: p1 in l1_3, p2 in t1 (in l1_4), t1 in l1_4, t2 in l2_1, a1 in l1_1, a2 in l1_1

14. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1
    - Now: p1 in l1_3, p2 in t1 (in l1_2), t1 in l1_2, t2 in l2_1, a1 in l1_1, a2 in l1_1

p2 is in l1_2 (via t1), which satisfies C3.

15. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
    - Now: p1 in l1_3, p2 in t1 (in l1_1), t1 in l1_1, t2 in l2_1, a1 in l1_1, a2 in l1_1

16. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
    - Now: p1 in l1_3, p2 in l1_1, t1 in l1_1, t2 in l2_1, a1 in l1_1, a2 in l1_1

p2 is now in l1_1, which satisfies C4. C5 requires that when or after p2 is in l1_1, p1 should be in l1_4 or l2_1. But p1 is in l1_3, so we need to move p1 to l1_4 or l2_1.

17. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
    - Now: p1 in l1_3, p2 in l1_1, t1 in l1_3, t2 in l2_1, a1 in l1_1, a2 in l1_1

18. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
    - Now: p1 in t1 (in l1_3), p2 in l1_1, t1 in l1_3, t2 in l2_1, a1 in l1_1, a2 in l1_1

19. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1
    - Now: p1 in t1 (in l1_4), p2 in l1_1, t1 in l1_4, t2 in l2_1, a1 in l1_1, a2 in l1_1

20. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
    - Now: p1 in l1_4, p2 in l1_1, t1 in l1_4, t2 in l2_1, a1 in l1_1, a2 in l1_1

p1 is now in l1_4, which satisfies C5 after p2 is in l1_1.

21. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
    - Now: p1 in l1_4, p2 in l1_1, t1 in l1_1, t2 in l2_1, a1 in l1_1, a2 in l1_1

22. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
    - Now: p1 in l1_4, p2 in a1 (in l1_1), t1 in l1_1, t2 in l2_1, a1 in l1_1, a2 in l1_1

23. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
    - Now: p1 in l1_4, p2 in a1 (in l2_1), t1 in l1_1, t2 in l2_1, a1 in l2_1, a2 in l1_1

24. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
    - Now: p1 in l1_4, p2 in l2_1, t1 in l1_1, t2 in l2_1, a1 in l2_1, a2 in l1_1

p2 is now in l2_1, which satisfies C1. Note that p1 was in l1_3 before p2 reached l2_1, which satisfies C2.

25. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
    - Now: p1 in l1_4, p2 in t2 (in l2_1), t1 in l1_1, t2 in l2_1, a1 in l2_1, a2 in l1_1

26. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
    - Now: p1 in l1_4, p2 in t2 (in l2_2), t1 in l1_1, t2 in l2_2, a1 in l2_1, a2 in l1_1

27. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
    - Now: p1 in l1_4, p2 in l2_2, t1 in l1_1, t2 in l2_2, a1 in l2_1, a2 in l1_1

p2 has reached its goal.

28. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
    - Now: p1 in l1_4, p2 in l2_2, t1 in l1_4, t2 in l2_2, a1 in l2_1, a2 in l1_1

29. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
    - Now: p1 in t1 (in l1_4), p2 in l2_2, t1 in l1_4, t2 in l2_2, a1 in l2_1, a2 in l1_1

30. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1
    - Now: p1 in t1 (in l1_5), p2 in l2_2, t1 in l1_5, t2 in l2_2, a1 in l2_1, a2 in l1_1

31. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
    - Now: p1 in l1_5, p2 in l2_2, t1 in l1_5, t2 in l2_2, a1 in l2_1, a2 in l1_1

Both p1 and p2 have reached their goals, and all constraints have been satisfied as previously outlined.

So the plan is:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
3. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
5. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
6. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
7. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
8. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
9. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
10. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
11. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
12. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1
13. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
14. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1
15. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
16. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
17. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
18. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
19. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1
20. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
21. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
22. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
23. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
24. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
25. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
26. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
27. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
28. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
29. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
30. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1
31. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5

But wait, something is wrong in the initial state. Let me double-check:

The initial state says:
"Package t1 is in location l1_4"
"Package t2 is in location l2_1"
"Package p1 is in location l2_3"
"Package p2 is in location l1_4"
"Package a1 is in location l1_1"
"Package a2 is in location l2_1"

But t1, t2, a1, and a2 are supposed to be trucks and airplanes, not packages. Let me restate the initial state:

- t1 (a truck) is in location l1_4
- t2 (a truck) is in location l2_1
- p1 (a package) is in location l2_3
- p2 (a package) is in location l1_4
- a1 (an airplane) is in location l1_1
- a2 (an airplane) is in location l2_1

With this corrected understanding, the plan I provided earlier is still valid.
