Okay, let's try to figure out this planning problem. So, the goal is to get p1 to l2_4 and p2 to l2_1, right? But there are some constraints to satisfy as well. Let's start by understanding the initial state and the required conditions.

First, the initial state. The packages p1 and p2 are both in location l2_2, which is in city c2. The trucks t1 is in l1_3 (city c1), and t2 is in l2_5 (city c2). The airplanes a1 is at l1_1 (c1's airport), and a2 is at l2_1 (c2's airport). 

The constraints are:
1. At some point, p2 must be in l2_4.
2. At some point, p1 must be in a1.
3. At some point, p2 must be in l2_1 (which is the final goal for p2, so that's already covered, but maybe it's required before the end? Or maybe the final state counts as a state where it's true. Hmm.)
4. If p2 is in l2_1 in some state, then there must be an earlier state where p1 is either in l1_3 or l2_3.

So, the plan has to include steps where p2 is moved to l2_4, then maybe moved again. Also, p1 has to be loaded into a1 at some point. Also, when p2 arrives at l2_1, we need to check that p1 was in l1_3 or l2_3 before that.

Let's think about moving p1 to l2_4. Since l2_4 is in city c2, and p1 starts in l2_2 (c2), maybe using a truck in c2. But wait, the trucks available are t1 (in c1) and t2 (in c2). So t2 is in c2's l2_5. To get p1 from l2_2 to l2_4, maybe use t2. But how?

Wait, p1 is in l2_2. To load it into a truck, the truck needs to be there. So maybe drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2, load p1 into t2, drive to l2_4, then unload. But then how does that satisfy the constraint that p1 is in a1? Oh, the constraint says that p1 must be in a1 at some state. So maybe p1 has to be loaded into a1 at some point. But a1 is in l1_1 (c1's airport). So how does p1 get there?

Wait, maybe we need to use an airplane to move p1 between cities. Since airplanes can fly between airports. So, maybe p1 is first moved via truck to an airport in c2, then loaded onto an airplane (a2, which is at l2_1), fly to l1_1 (c1's airport), load into a1, then fly back? But that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe a1 is used to transport p1, but a1 starts in l1_1. So to get p1 into a1, we need to get p1 to l1_1. That would require moving it from c2 to c1. So perhaps using airplane a2 to carry p1 from l2_1 (c2's airport) to l1_1 (c1's airport), then load into a1, then fly back to c2? But why would that be needed? Wait, the constraint requires that p1 is in a1 at some state. So even if we load it into a1 and then unload it immediately, that would satisfy the constraint. But how to get p1 into a1.

Alternatively, maybe we can have a1 fly to c2's airport, pick up p1, but wait, airplanes can only fly between airports. So a1 is in l1_1. To get a1 to l2_1 (c2's airport), we can fly it there. Then load p1 into a1 at l2_1. But how does p1 get to l2_1? Because initially, p1 is in l2_2. So maybe use truck t2 in c2 to move p1 from l2_2 to l2_1 (airport), then load into a1. But then after that, we need to move p1 back to c2's l2_4. Hmm.

This seems a bit tangled. Let's outline the steps.

First, handle the constraints:

1. p2 must be in l2_4 at some point. So, in the plan, we need to move p2 from l2_2 to l2_4, then maybe move it again to l2_1. But the final goal is p2 in l2_1, so perhaps we first take p2 to l2_4, then to l2_1. That would satisfy the first constraint.

2. p1 must be in a1. So, load p1 into a1 at some point. But a1 starts in l1_1 (c1). To get p1 there, we need to move p1 from c2 to c1. So steps could be: move p1 from l2_2 (c2) to l2_1 (c2's airport) via truck, load into a2, fly a2 to l1_1 (c1's airport), unload p1 into l1_1, load into a1 (so that p1 is in a1), then fly a1 back to l2_1, unload p1, then move p1 to l2_4. But this seems long, and maybe there's a shorter way.

Alternatively, can we load p1 into a1 while a1 is in l1_1, but p1 is in c2. That's impossible unless we transport p1 to l1_1. So that's a must. So p1 has to be moved to l1_1 first.

Wait, but how? Since airplanes can carry packages. So, steps for p1:

1. In c2, use truck t2 to move p1 from l2_2 to l2_1 (the airport). Because t2 is in l2_5, so drive t2 to l2_2, load p1, drive to l2_1, unload. Then load p1 into airplane a2 (which is at l2_1). Fly a2 to l1_1. Unload p1 at l1_1. Then load p1 into a1 (which is at l1_1). Then, to get p1 back to c2, fly a1 to l2_1, unload p1, then use truck t2 again to move it to l2_4. But wait, the final goal is p1 in l2_4. So after unloading from a1 at l2_1, load into t2 and drive to l2_4.

But this seems like a lot of steps. Let's check if that works.

But also, the fourth constraint: if p2 is in l2_1, then p1 was in l1_3 or l2_3 before. The final state has p2 in l2_1, so we need to ensure that in some earlier state, p1 was in l1_3 or l2_3.

Hmm. So, when p2 arrives at l2_1, which is the airport in c2, perhaps we need to have p1 in one of those locations before that. Let's think: during the plan, when p2 is moved to l2_1 (the final step for p2), we need to have had p1 in l1_3 or l2_3 before that step. But maybe in the plan, before moving p2 to l2_1, p1 is in l2_3 or l1_3.

Wait, but p1 starts in l2_2. To get it to l2_3, that's within c2. So maybe use truck t2 to drive it from l2_2 to l2_3, but why? Unless that's part of the path. Alternatively, maybe during the process of moving p1 to l1_3 (which is in c1), but that's in a different city. So perhaps during the transportation of p1 to c1, it passes through l1_3. But l1_3 is a location in c1, which is where truck t1 is. So, maybe when p1 is in c1, truck t1 is used to move it to l1_3. But why?

This is getting complicated. Let's try to outline a possible plan step by step.

First, handling p1:

1. Move p1 from l2_2 to l2_1 (c2's airport) using truck t2.

   - Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2: drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2

   - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

   - drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2

   - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

2. Load p1 into a2 (which is at l2_1): loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

3. Fly a2 to l1_1 (c1's airport): flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

4. Unload p1 from a2 into l1_1: unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

5. Load p1 into a1 (which is at l1_1): loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (this satisfies the constraint that p1 is in a1)

6. Fly a1 to l2_1: flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

7. Unload p1 from a1 into l2_1: unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

8. Load p1 into t2 (if t2 is at l2_1): but wait, after step 1, t2 was at l2_1. Then in step 1, after unloading, t2 is still at l2_1. So yes, load p1 into t2 again.

   - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

   - drive t2 to l2_4: drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2

   - unload p1 at l2_4: unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (this achieves p1's goal)

But wait, the final goal is p1 in l2_4. So steps 1-8 handle p1.

Now for p2:

Original location l2_2. Need to get to l2_1. But with a constraint that p2 must be in l2_4 at some point.

So steps for p2:

1. Move p2 from l2_2 to l2_4.

   - Use truck t2. But t2 is at l2_1 after step 1. Wait, initial state: t2 is in l2_5. So step 1 for p1 starts by driving t2 from l2_5 to l2_2 (to pick up p1). But p2 is also in l2_2. So maybe after moving p1, we can use t2 again to move p2.

But after moving p1 to l2_1, t2 is at l2_1. To move p2, which is still in l2_2, we need to drive t2 back to l2_2. Wait, but that's after step 1, where t2 is at l2_1. So:

After step 1 (moving p1 to l2_1), t2 is in l2_1. Then, to move p2 from l2_2 to l2_4:

But p2 is in l2_2. So we need to get a truck to l2_2. However, the only truck in c2 is t2. So maybe after unloading p1 at l2_1, drive t2 back to l2_2 to pick up p2.

Wait, let's adjust the plan:

After step 1 (unload p1 at l2_1), drive t2 back to l2_2 to pick up p2.

So steps for p2:

- drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2

- loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

- drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2

- unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (satisfies the first constraint)

Then, to get p2 to l2_1:

- loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

- drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2

- unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (final goal for p2)

But this adds steps. Let's see the order.

But let's check the timing. The steps for p1 and p2 might need to be interleaved. For example, after moving p1 to l2_1, then handle p2.

But we need to make sure that when p2 is unloaded at l2_1 (final step), the constraint about p1 being in l1_3 or l2_3 before that is satisfied.

So when does p1 get to l1_3 or l2_3?

Wait, in the current plan, p1 is moved to l1_1 (c1's airport) via a2, then loaded into a1, then flown back to l2_1. So during this process, when is p1 in l1_3 or l2_3? It doesn't seem like it. So we need to adjust the plan to include p1 being in one of those locations before p2 arrives at l2_1.

So, perhaps during the transportation of p1 to c1, we can have it pass through l1_3. How? Because l1_3 is in city c1. So once p1 is in c1's airport l1_1, maybe use truck t1 (which is in l1_3) to move p1 to l1_3. Then unload it there. That would put p1 in l1_3. Then later, load it back into t1, drive to l1_1, load into a1, then fly back to c2.

But this adds more steps, but ensures that p1 is in l1_3 before p2 is in l2_1. Let's adjust the plan:

After step 4 (p1 is unloaded at l1_1), use truck t1 (which is in l1_3) to drive to l1_1, load p1 into t1, drive to l1_3, unload. Then, later, drive back to l1_1 to load into a1.

So steps:

4. Unload p1 from a2 into l1_1.

5. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1: drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1

6. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

7. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1

8. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (now p1 is in l1_3, satisfying the condition for the constraint)

Then, proceed to load p1 into a1:

9. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1: drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1

10. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (now p1 is in a1, satisfying the second constraint)

11. fly a1 to l2_1.

12. unload p1 from a1 into l2_1.

13. load p1 into t2 (which is at l2_1 after earlier steps)

14. drive to l2_4 and unload.

But this adds several steps. Now, when p2 is unloaded at l2_1 (final step for p2), the earlier state where p1 was in l1_3 exists (step 8). So that satisfies the fourth constraint.

So the plan would look something like this:

For p1:

1. Move p1 from l2_2 to l2_1 via t2.

   a. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2

   b. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

   c. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2

   d. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

2. Load p1 into a2.

   e. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

3. Fly a2 to l1_1.

   f. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

4. Unload p1 into l1_1.

   g. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

5. Move p1 to l1_3 via t1.

   h. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1

   i. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

   j. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1

   k. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3

6. Move p1 back to l1_1 via t1.

   l. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1

   m. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

7. Fly a1 to l2_1.

   n. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

8. Unload p1 from a1 into l2_1.

   o. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

9. Load p1 into t2.

   p. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

10. Drive t2 to l2_4.

   q. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2

11. Unload p1 at l2_4.

   r. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

For p2:

1. After moving p1 to l2_1 (step d), drive t2 back to l2_2.

   s. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2

2. Load p2 into t2.

   t. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

3. Drive to l2_4.

   u. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2

4. Unload p2 at l2_4 (satisfy constraint).

   v. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

5. Load p2 back into t2.

   w. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

6. Drive to l2_1.

   x. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2

7. Unload p2 at l2_1.

   y. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

But we need to check the order of steps. For example, after step d (unload p1 at l2_1), the steps for p2 would start. But during that time, p1 is being moved to c1, etc. So we need to interleave these steps.

Wait, but the steps for p1 and p2 can be interleaved as long as the dependencies are maintained. However, the movement of t2 is involved in both, so we need to sequence them correctly.

Let me outline the full plan step by step, considering dependencies:

1. Move t2 to l2_2 to pick up p1.

   a. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2

2. Load p1 into t2.

   b. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

3. Drive t2 to l2_1.

   c. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2

4. Unload p1 at l2_1.

   d. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

5. Load p1 into a2.

   e. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

6. Fly a2 to l1_1.

   f. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

7. Unload p1 into l1_1.

   g. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

8. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1.

   h. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1

9. Load p1 into t1.

   i. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

10. Drive t1 to l1_3.

   j. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1

11. Unload p1 in l1_3. (Now p1 is in l1_3, satisfying the fourth constraint's earlier state.)

   k. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3

12. Drive t1 back to l1_1.

   l. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1

13. Load p1 into a1.

   m. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

14. Fly a1 to l2_1.

   n. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

15. Unload p1 into l2_1.

   o. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

16. Load p1 into t2.

   p. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

17. Drive t2 to l2_4.

   q. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2

18. Unload p1 at l2_4. (Achieves p1's goal.)

   r. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

Now, for p2:

But during these steps, t2 is moving. After step 4 (unload p1 at l2_1), t2 is at l2_1. To move p2 from l2_2, which is where p2 is initially, we need t2 to go back to l2_2. However, after step 4, t2 is at l2_1. So after step 4, we can drive t2 back to l2_2 to pick up p2.

So inserting steps for p2:

After step 4:

19. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2

20. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

21. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2

22. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (satisfies first constraint)

Then, p2 is in l2_4. Now, to get it to l2_1, we need to load it back into t2, drive to l2_1.

But wait, after step 22, t2 is at l2_4. Then:

23. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

24. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2

25. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (final goal)

But after step 24, t2 arrives at l2_1. Then steps 16-18 for p1 would be after step 25. Wait, but that can't be. Because after step 25, p2 is in l2_1, but p1's steps require using t2 again. So we need to sequence this correctly.

Alternatively, after step 22 (p2 in l2_4), we can move p2 to l2_1 before handling p1's steps from 16 onward.

But let's see:

The steps for p1 after step 15 (unloaded into l2_1) need to load into t2, which is at l2_1. But if after step 4, we have steps 19-25, then t2 would be at l2_1 after step 25, but p1's steps 16-18 (loading into t2 and moving to l2_4) would need to happen after that. But the problem is that in step 25, we unload p2 at l2_1, which is the final goal. So after that, we can't use t2 again for p1, but wait, no, we can. Because the final state just requires p1 to be in l2_4 and p2 in l2_1.

Wait, but the final step for p1 is step 18 (unload at l2_4), which must come after p2 is already at l2_1. But that would require p2 to be moved first. However, the fourth constraint requires that before p2 is in l2_1, p1 was in l1_3 or l2_3. So, if p2 is moved to l2_1 in step 25, then the step where p1 was in l1_3 (step 11) must be before step 25. Which it is. So the order is:

Steps 1-11: p1 is moved to l1_3.

Steps 19-25: p2 is moved to l2_1 via l2_4.

But after step 25, p2 is in l2_1. Then steps 12-18 for p1 would come after. But that's not possible because the final goal for p1 is l2_4, which would need to happen after step 25. But step 25 already unloaded p2 at l2_1, which is the final goal. So maybe the plan needs to move p2 to l2_1 after moving p1 to l2_4. Wait, but how?

Alternatively, after step 11 (p1 in l1_3), we can proceed to move p2, then continue with p1's steps.

Let me try to outline the entire plan in order, interleaving p1 and p2's steps:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2 (move t2 to p1's location)

2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (load p1)

3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 (move p1 to airport)

4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (p1 at airport)

5. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (load into a2)

6. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (fly to c1's airport)

7. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (p1 in l1_1)

8. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1 (t1 moves to airport)

9. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (load p1 into t1)

10. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1 (move to l1_3)

11. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (p1 in l1_3, satisfying constraint)

Now, p1 is in l1_3. Then, handle p2:

12. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2 (t2 moves back to p2's location)

13. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (load p2)

14. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2 (move to l2_4)

15. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (p2 in l2_4, satisfying first constraint)

16. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (reload p2)

17. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2 (move p2 to airport)

18. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (p2 in l2_1, final goal. But before this step, check if p1 was in l1_3 or l2_3. Since step 11 was before step 18, it's okay.)

Now, continue with p1's steps to get to l2_4:

19. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1 (move t1 back to airport)

20. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (load into a1, satisfying second constraint)

21. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (fly to c2's airport)

22. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 (p1 in l2_1)

23. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (load into t2)

24. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2 (move to l2_4)

25. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (final goal for p1)

But wait, step 18 already unloaded p2 into l2_1. Then step 23 uses t2 (which is at l2_1) to load p1 again, then drive to l2_4. That would work. So the final steps for p1 are after p2 has been delivered.

But let's check the order:

- After step 18, p2 is in l2_1. Then, steps 19-25 are for p1.

But wait, step 19 is moving t1 in c1, which doesn't interfere. Then step 20 loads p1 into a1 (which is at l1_1), fly to l2_1, unload, load into t2 (which is at l2_1), drive to l2_4.

Yes, that works.

So this plan includes all required steps. Let's check all constraints:

- p2 is in l2_4 (step 15).

- p1 is in a1 (step 20).

- p2 is in l2_1 (step 18 and also final state).

- The fourth constraint: when p2 is in l2_1 (step 18), there's an earlier state where p1 is in l1_3 (step 11).

Yes, all constraints are satisfied.

Now, check for optimality (shortest possible plan). The current plan has 25 steps, but maybe some steps can be merged or shortened.

For example, after step 18 (unload p2 at l2_1), t2 is at l2_1. Then, step 23 (load p1 into t2) requires p1 to be in l2_1. But p1 is unloaded from a1 at step 22 (unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1). So step 22 must come after step 21 (fly a1 to l2_1). So the sequence is correct.

But maybe some steps can be optimized. For instance, when moving p1 from l1_3 to l1_1 (step 19), then loading into a1 (step 20), then flying to l2_1 (step 21), etc. That seems necessary.

Alternatively, is there a way to avoid moving p1 to l1_3? Because the fourth constraint requires that p1 is in l1_3 or l2_3 before p2 is in l2_1. If during the plan, p1 is in l2_3, maybe that could be done more efficiently.

Wait, p1 starts in l2_2 (c2). Suppose we move p1 to l2_3 in c2 using t2, then move it to the airport. But why? Because then p1 would be in l2_3, which would satisfy the fourth constraint.

But then, how to get p1 into a1? Because a1 is in c1's airport. So we would still need to fly p1 to c1, but maybe without going through l1_3.

Let's think:

Alternative approach for p1:

1. Move p1 from l2_2 to l2_3 using t2.

   - drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2

   - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

   - drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2

   - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (now p1 is in l2_3, satisfying the fourth constraint's earlier state)

Then, move p1 to l2_1:

   - drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

   - loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

   - fly a2 to l1_1

   - unload into l1_1

   - load into a1, fly back, etc.

This way, step where p1 is in l2_3 occurs before p2 is moved to l2_1. But would this reduce the number of steps?

Let's see:

Steps for p1:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2

2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2

4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (p1 in l2_3)

5. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

6. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

7. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

9. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (satisfies constraint)

10. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

11. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

12. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

13. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2

14. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

For p2:

15. After step 5 (t2 at l2_1), drive t2 to l2_2 to pick up p2.

   But after step 5, t2 is at l2_1. To pick up p2 from l2_2:

16. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2

17. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

18. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2

19. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (constraint met)

20. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

21. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2

22. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (final goal)

But this plan would have 22 steps. Let's count:

p1 steps: 14 steps.

p2 steps: 7 steps (steps 15-22, which are steps 16-22 in the list).

But total steps would be 22. Let me recount:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2 (p1)

2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2

4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

5. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

6. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

7. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

8. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

9. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

10. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

11. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

12. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

13. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2

14. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

For p2:

15. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2 (after step 5, t2 is at l2_1. But after step 5 is step 6, then up to step 14, t2 is used for p1. Wait, after step 5, t2 is at l2_1. Then steps 6-14 involve a2 and a1, but t2 is still at l2_1. Then in step 12, p1 is loaded into t2 again, which is at l2_1. So after step 14, t2 is at l2_4. So to move p2, after step 14, t2 is at l2_4. But p2 is in l2_2. So steps for p2 would need to use t2 after step 14. But p2's steps need to be interleaved.

Alternatively, after step 5 (t2 at l2_1), use t2 to move p2:

But between step 5 and step 6, there's an opportunity to move p2.

But after step 5, t2 is at l2_1. So:

Step 5: t2 at l2_1.

Step 6: load p1 into a2.

So after step 5, before step 6, t2 can be used to move p2:

But p2 is in l2_2. So:

After step 5:

15. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2 (move t2 to p2)

16. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

17. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2

18. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

19. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

20. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2

21. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

Then, proceed with steps 6-14 for p1.

But this way, p2 is moved to l2_1 before p1's steps 6-14. However, when p2 is unloaded at l2_1 (step 21), we need to check that p1 was in l2_3 or l1_3 before that. At step 4, p1 is in l2_3. So step 4 occurs before step 21, which is correct.

But then, after step 21, t2 is at l2_1. Then steps 6-14 would use t2 to load p1 into a2, but wait, after step 5, t2 is at l2_1. Then step 6: load p1 into a2 (but p1 is in l2_3 at that point? No, wait, this approach may have a mistake.

Wait, in this alternative plan, after step 5 (t2 at l2_1), p1 is in l2_3 (step 4). So to load p1 into a2, which is at l2_1, we need to have p1 at l2_1. But p1 is in l2_3. So this approach is flawed. Because after step 4, p1 is in l2_3, and t2 is at l2_1 (step 5). So to move p1 to l2_1, we need to use t2 to pick it up from l2_3.

But in this alternative approach, steps 1-5 are:

1. t2 drives to l2_2, loads p1, drives to l2_3, unloads p1, then drives to l2_1 (step 5).

So p1 is in l2_3, and t2 is at l2_1.

So to get p1 into a2 (which is at l2_1), we need to move p1 from l2_3 to l2_1. So steps:

6. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2 (t2 moves to l2_3)

7. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

8. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

9. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

10. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

11. fly a2 to l1_1

etc.

This adds more steps, making the plan longer. So this approach is not better.

Therefore, the initial plan where p1 is moved to l1_3 may be more efficient, despite the steps in c1.

Another way to reduce steps: After p1 is in l1_1 (step 7), load directly into a1 without using truck t1. But wait, the airplane a1 is at l1_1. So if p1 is in l1_1 (step 7), can we load it into a1 directly?

Yes! Because the loadairplane action requires that both p1 and a1 are in the same location. So step 7: p1 is in l1_1, a1 is also in l1_1. So step 8 can be loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1. Then fly a1 to l2_1.

This would save steps involving truck t1. Let's see:

Original steps after step 7 (p1 in l1_1):

8. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1 (to move t1 to l1_1)

9. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (load into t1)

10. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1 (move to l1_3)

11. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (p1 in l1_3)

But if instead, after step 7, we load p1 directly into a1:

8. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (satisfies constraint that p1 is in a1)

9. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

10. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

Then, steps for p1:

11. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

12. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2

13. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

But this skips moving p1 to l1_3. However, the fourth constraint requires that before p2 is in l2_1, p1 was in l1_3 or l2_3. In this scenario, p1 was never in l1_3 or l2_3, so the fourth constraint is not satisfied. Therefore, we can't skip moving p1 to l1_3.

So that approach won't work. So we have to move p1 to l1_3 or l2_3.

Another idea: after loading p1 into a1 (step 8 in the alternative approach), fly to l2_1, unload, then move p1 to l2_3 using t2. But this would require:

After step 10 (unload p1 from a1 to l2_1):

11. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

12. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2

13. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

Then, p1 is in l2_3. Then, move p1 back to l2_1 and proceed to l2_4. But this adds steps, but satisfies the fourth constraint.

But then, when p2 is moved to l2_1 (after p1 is in l2_3), the constraint is satisfied.

But in this case, the steps would be:

For p1:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2

2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2

4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

5. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

6. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

7. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

8. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (p1 in a1)

9. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

10. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

11. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

12. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2

13. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (now p1 is in l2_3)

14. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

15. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2

16. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

For p2:

After step 4 (t2 at l2_1):

17. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2

18. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

19. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2

20. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (constraint met)

21. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

22. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2

23. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (final goal)

But step 23 is after step 13, where p1 is in l2_3. So the constraint is satisfied.

This plan has 23 steps. But is this shorter than the initial plan? The initial plan had 25 steps. Let's count:

p1 steps: 16 steps.

p2 steps: 7 steps (steps 17-23).

But wait, after step 16 (p1 in l2_4), p2's steps would be:

But in this plan, after step 16, p1 is already in l2_4. Then steps 17-23 for p2 are:

17. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2 (Wait, no. After step 16, t2 is at l2_4. So to pick up p2 from l2_2, t2 needs to drive back to l2_2. But after step 16, t2 is at l2_4. So step 17 would be:

17. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2

But p2 is in l2_2. Then:

18. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

19. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2

20. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (but this is already step 20)

Wait, this seems redundant. Because steps 19-20 would be driving back to l2_4, which is where t2 was already. So this would move p2 from l2_2 to l2_4, unload, then load again and drive to l2_1.

But this plan seems to have redundant steps. For example, after step 16, t2 is at l2_4 with p1 unloaded. Then, to move p2, t2 has to go back to l2_2, load p2, drive to l2_4 again (step 19), then to l2_1. But p2 is already in l2_4 after step 20. So this is not efficient.

Alternatively, after step 16, t2 is at l2_4. To move p2, which is in l2_2, t2 needs to go to l2_2. So:

17. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2

18. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

19. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 (directly to l2_1)

20. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (final goal)

But this way, p2 is moved from l2_2 to l2_1 via t2, but doesn't pass through l2_4. So the constraint that p2 must be in l2_4 at some state isn't satisfied. Therefore, this approach won't work.

Hence, the initial approach of moving p2 to l2_4 first is necessary.

So, the optimal plan would require moving p1 through l1_3 and p2 through l2_4, leading to a longer plan but satisfying all constraints. 

Considering all this, the initial plan with 25 steps seems to be the minimal required to meet all constraints and goals. However, perhaps there's a smarter way to interleave steps to reduce the total number.

Another observation: When moving p1 to l1_3, the truck t1 is used. But after that, t1 is at l1_3. Maybe we can reuse t1 for other purposes, but in this problem, there's no need since all packages are in c2.

Alternatively, perhaps after moving p1 to l1_3, we can use a different airplane to move it back, but that doesn't seem to help.

After careful consideration, I think the initial plan with 25 steps is necessary to meet all constraints. But let me recount to ensure that each step is necessary and there are no redundancies.

Another possible optimization: After moving p1 to l1_3 (step 11), when moving t1 back to l1_1 (step 12), can we combine this with other steps? For example, after unloading p1 at l1_3 (step 11), immediately load it back into t1 and drive to l1_1. But that would require steps:

After step 11:

12. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3

13. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1

14. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

15. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

But this adds steps. So no optimization here.

Alternatively, perhaps after step 11 (p1 in l1_3), we can fly a1 to l1_3 to load p1. But a1 is an airplane, which can only be at airports. l1_3 is not an airport (since l1_1 is the airport of c1). So airplanes can't land there. So that's impossible.

Thus, the initial plan seems to be the most optimal.
