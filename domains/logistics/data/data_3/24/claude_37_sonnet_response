Let me parse and understand the logistics problem:

Objects:
- Cities: c1, c2
- Locations in c1: l1_1 (airport), l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5
- Locations in c2: l2_1 (airport), l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5
- Packages: p1, p2
- Trucks: t1, t2
- Airplanes: a1, a2

Initial state:
- t1 is in location l1_3 (I think there's a typo here - t1 should be a truck, not a package)
- t2 is in location l2_5 (same typo)
- p1 is in location l2_2
- p2 is in location l2_2
- a1 is in location l1_1 (another typo - a1 should be an airplane)
- a2 is in location l2_1 (same typo)

Goal:
- p1 is in location l2_4
- p2 is in location l2_1

Constraints:
1. p2 must be in location l2_4 at some point
2. p1 must be in airplane a1 at some point
3. p2 must be in location l2_1 at some point
4. Before p2 can be in location l2_1, p1 must have been in location l1_3 or l2_3

I think there are some typos in the initial state description. Let me assume the correct initial state is:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_3
- Truck t2 is in location l2_5
- Package p1 is in location l2_2
- Package p2 is in location l2_2
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

Now let me plan a solution:

First, I need to analyze what the constraints mean for our plan:
1. p2 must visit l2_4 before ending at l2_1
2. p1 must be transported in airplane a1 at some point
3. p1 must visit either l1_3 or l2_3 before p2 can end up at l2_1

Let's outline a plan:

1. For p1:
   - p1 starts at l2_2
   - We need to move p1 to l2_4 (goal) using truck t2
   - We also need p1 to be in airplane a1 at some point (constraint)
   - And p1 must visit l1_3 or l2_3 (constraint)
   
2. For p2:
   - p2 starts at l2_2
   - p2 must visit l2_4 (constraint)
   - p2 must end at l2_1 (goal)
   - p2 can only end at l2_1 after p1 has visited l1_3 or l2_3

So a general plan might be:
- Move p1 to either l1_3 or l2_3
- Move p2 to l2_4
- Move p1 to airplane a1 at some point
- Move p1 to its final destination l2_4
- Move p2 to its final destination l2_1

Let's create a detailed step-by-step plan:

Starting with p1:
- p1 starts at l2_2
- We need to move truck t2 from l2_5 to l2_2
- Load p1 onto t2
- Drive t2 to l2_3 (to satisfy constraint 4)
- Unload p1 at l2_3
- We need to get p1 onto airplane a1 (to satisfy constraint 2)
- a1 starts at l1_1, so we need to move it to an airport in c2
- Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1
- We need to get p1 to the airport l2_1
- Load p1 onto t2 again
- Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1
- Unload p1 at l2_1
- Load p1 onto a1 (satisfying constraint 2)
- We need to get p1 to l2_4 (the goal)
- Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1
- Load p1 onto t2
- Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4
- Unload p1 at l2_4 (satisfying the goal for p1)

For p2:
- p2 starts at l2_2
- We need to move truck t2 from its current location to l2_2
- Load p2 onto t2
- Drive t2 to l2_4 (satisfying constraint 1)
- Keep p2 on the truck
- Drive t2 to l2_1
- Unload p2 at l2_1 (satisfying the goal for p2 and constraint 3)

Actually, this plan isn't optimal. Let's re-think it more carefully:

Starting state:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_3 (city c1)
- Truck t2 is in location l2_5 (city c2)
- Package p1 is in location l2_2 (city c2)
- Package p2 is in location l2_2 (city c2)
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (airport in city c1)
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1 (airport in city c2)

Constraints and goals:
1. Goal: p1 must end at l2_4
2. Goal: p2 must end at l2_1
3. Constraint: p2 must visit l2_4 at some point
4. Constraint: p1 must be in airplane a1 at some point
5. Constraint: p1 must visit l1_3 or l2_3 before p2 can be at l2_1

Let's try to create a more optimal plan:

1. Move truck t2 from l2_5 to l2_2
2. Load p1 onto truck t2
3. Drive truck t2 from l2_2 to l2_3 (satisfying constraint 5)
4. Drive truck t2 from l2_3 to l2_1 (airport)
5. Move airplane a1 from l1_1 to l2_1
6. Unload p1 from truck t2 at l2_1
7. Load p1 onto airplane a1 (satisfying constraint 4)
8. Fly airplane a1 back to l1_1 (just to move it out of the way)
9. Go back to l2_2 with truck t2
10. Load p2 onto truck t2
11. Drive truck t2 from l2_2 to l2_4 (satisfying constraint 3)
12. Unload p2 from truck t2 at l2_4
13. Load p2 back onto truck t2
14. Drive truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_1
15. Unload p2 from truck t2 at l2_1 (satisfying goal for p2)
16. Drive truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_4
17. Unload p1 from airplane a1 (wait, this doesn't work since a1 is at l1_1)

Ok, I see I'm making some mistakes. Let me carefully track where everything is at each step:

1. Move truck t2 from l2_5 to l2_2
   - t2 is now at l2_2
   - p1 is at l2_2
   - p2 is at l2_2
   - a1 is at l1_1 (airport c1)
   - a2 is at l2_1 (airport c2)

2. Load p1 onto truck t2
   - t2 is at l2_2 with p1 loaded
   - p2 is at l2_2
   - a1 is at l1_1
   - a2 is at l2_1

3. Drive truck t2 from l2_2 to l2_3
   - t2 is at l2_3 with p1 loaded
   - p2 is at l2_2
   - a1 is at l1_1
   - a2 is at l2_1
   - (satisfied constraint 5 - p1 has visited l2_3)

4. We need to get p1 into airplane a1, which is at l1_1
   - Options:
     a) Fly a1 to l2_1, drive t2 to l2_1, unload p1, load p1 onto a1
     b) Unload p1 at l2_3, drive t2 back to l2_2, load p2, then later pick up p1

   Let's go with option a:

   - t2 is at l2_1 with p1 loaded
   - p2 is at l2_2
   - a1 is at l1_1

   - a2 is at l2_1

7. Unload p1 from truck t2 at l2_1

11. Drive truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_2
    - t2 is at l2_2 with p1 loaded
    - p2 is at l2_2

    - a2 is at l2_1

13. Load p2 onto truck t2
    - t2 is at l2_2 with p2 loaded
    - p1 is at l2_2
    - a1 is at l2_1
    - a2 is at l2_1

14. Drive truck t2 from l2_2 to l2_4
    - t2 is at l2_4 with p2 loaded
    - p1 is at l2_2
    - a1 is at l2_1
    - a2 is at l2_1

15. Unload p2 from truck t2 at l2_4
    - t2 is at l2_4
    - p1 is at l2_2
    - p2 is at l2_4
    - a1 is at l2_1
    - a2 is at l2_1
    - (satisfied constraint 3 - p2 has visited l2_4)

16. Load p2 back onto truck t2
    - t2 is at l2_4 with p2 loaded
    - p1 is at l2_2
    - a1 is at l2_1

18. Unload p2 from truck t2 at l2_1
    - t2 is at l2_1
    - p1 is at l2_2
    - p2 is at l2_1
    - a1 is at l2_1
    - a2 is at l2_1
    - (satisfied goal - p2 is at l2_1)

19. Drive truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_2

    - p1 is at l2_2
    - p2 is at l2_1
    - a1 is at l2_1
    - a2 is at l2_1

    - p2 is at l2_1
    - a1 is at l2_1
    - a2 is at l2_1
    - (satisfied goal - p1 is at l2_4)

Let me check that all constraints and goals are satisfied:
- Goal: p1 is at l2_4 ✓ (step 22)
- Goal: p2 is at l2_1 ✓ (step 18)
- Constraint: p2 visited l2_4 ✓ (step 15)
- Constraint: p1 was in airplane a1 ✓ (step 8)
- Constraint: p1 visited l2_3 before p2 was at l2_1 ✓ (step 3 < step 18)

Now let me translate this plan into the required action format:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
4. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
6. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
7. loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
8. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
9. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
10. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
11. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
12. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
13. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2
14. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
15. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
16. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
17. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
18. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
19. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
20. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2
21. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

Wait, I see some issues with my plan. There's a shorter way to do this:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2 (satisfying constraint that p1 visits l2_3)
4. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
6. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
7. loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 (satisfying constraint that p1 is in a1)
8. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
9. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
10. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
11. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2
12. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (satisfying constraint that p2 visits l2_4)
13. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
14. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
15. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (satisfying goal for p2)
16. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
17. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
18. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (satisfying goal for p1)

Let me verify once more:
- Goal: p1 is at l2_4 ✓ (step 18)
- Goal: p2 is at l2_1 ✓ (step 15)
- Constraint: p2 visited l2_4 ✓ (step 12)
- Constraint: p1 was in airplane a1 ✓ (step 7)
- Constraint: p1 visited l2_3 before p2 was at l2_1 ✓ (step 3 < step 15)

This is an optimal, valid plan that satisfies all the constraints.

Actually, let me check one more time to ensure this is truly optimal:

I notice I'm making extra trips, like unloading p1 at l2_1, then driving away, then coming back for it later. Let me see if I can make this more efficient:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
3. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2  (carrying both packages)
4. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2 (p1 visits l2_3, satisfying constraint)
5. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
6. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (p2 visits l2_4, satisfying constraint)
7. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
8. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
9. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
10. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
11. loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 (p1 in a1, satisfying constraint)
12. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
13. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (p2 at final goal)
14. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
15. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
16. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (p1 at final goal)

But this doesn't look like it saved any steps, and wouldn't be legal with the current action definitions if we can't load two packages in a truck at once (which doesn't appear to be allowed). 

Let me try once more, focusing on making p1 visit l2_3 very early, then getting p1 into airplane a1 as quickly as possible:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2 (satisfying constraint that p1 visits l2_3)
4. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
6. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
7. loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 (satisfying constraint that p1 is in a1)
8. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
9. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
10. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
11. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2
12. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (satisfying constraint that p2 visits l2_4)
13. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
14. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
15. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (satisfying goal for p2)
16. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
17. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
18. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (satisfying goal for p1)

I believe this is the optimal solution with 18 steps. Let's check once more that all constraints are satisfied:

- Goal: p1 is at l2_4 ✓ (step 18)
- Goal: p2 is at l2_1 ✓ (step 15)
- Constraint: p2 visited l2_4 ✓ (step 12)
- Constraint: p1 was in airplane a1 ✓ (step 7)
- Constraint: p1 visited l2_3 before p2 was at l2_1 ✓ (step 3 < step 15)

I've been careful to track the state of the world after each action, and I believe this 18-step plan is valid and optimal.

Let me format the final plan:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
4. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
6. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
7. loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
8. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
9. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
10. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
11. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2
12. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
13. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
14. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
15. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
16. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
17. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
18. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
