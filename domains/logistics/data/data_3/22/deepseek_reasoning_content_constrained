Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. So, the goal is to have both p1 and p2 back in l1_3. But wait, they're already there in the initial state. The initial state says p1 and p2 are in l1_3. The goal is for both to be in l1_3. So, does that mean we don't need to do anything? But that seems too easy. Maybe there's a typo here. Let me check again.

Original state: "Package p1 is in location l1_3", same for p2. The goal is both in l1_3. So the initial state already satisfies the goal. But the problem must be designed such that there's a trick. Maybe there's a constraint that requires moving them out and back? Let me check the constraints.

Constraints:

1. At least once, p2 is in a1 or l2_5.
2. At least once, p1 is in t2 or p2 is in l2_3.
3. At least once, p2 is in l2_4 or a2.

So even though the initial state satisfies the goal, the constraints require that during the plan, these conditions are met. So the plan must involve moving p2 and p1 around to satisfy those constraints, and then bring them back to l1_3.

Wait, but the initial state already has p1 and p2 in l1_3, so the plan would need to move them out, satisfy the constraints, then bring them back. But how? Because if the goal is already met, but the constraints require intermediate steps.

But the problem says "the task is to bring about the following situation", which is already true initially. However, the constraints must be satisfied in at least one state during the plan. So even if the initial state is the goal, the constraints aren't met in the initial state. Let's check the constraints against the initial state.

Initial state:

- p2 is in l1_3. So for constraint 1: "p2 in a1 or l2_5". Initial state: p2 is not in a1 or l2_5. So constraint 1 is not satisfied initially. Similarly, constraint 2: "p1 in t2 or p2 in l2_3". Initial state: p2 is in l1_3, so not l2_3. So constraint 2 is not met. Constraint 3: "p2 in l2_4 or a2". Initial state: p2 is in l1_3, so no. So even though the goal is already met, the constraints require that during the plan execution, these conditions are met. Therefore, the plan must involve actions that make these conditions true at some point, even if the packages end up back where they started.

So the plan needs to move p1 and p2 in such a way that all three constraints are met in some state during the plan, and then return them to l1_3.

Let me outline each constraint and how to satisfy them.

Constraint 1: p2 must be in a1 or l2_5 at some point.

a1 is an airplane initially at l1_1. l2_5 is a location in city c2. So to get p2 to l2_5, we need to transport it there. But that's in a different city. So using airplanes. Alternatively, put p2 into a1 (the airplane in l1_1). But how?

But initially, p2 is in l1_3 (city c1). To load it into a1, which is in l1_1 (c1's airport), we need to move p2 from l1_3 to l1_1. But how? Since trucks can move within the city. So we can use a truck. Let's see: the available trucks are t1 and t2. t1 is in l1_5, t2 in l2_5. Wait, the original state says "Package t1 is in location l1_5" — wait, no. Wait, looking back at the original state:

Wait, the original state lists:

"Package t1 is in location l1_5"

Wait, but t1 is a truck. Trucks are not packages. That must be a typo. Because the user wrote "Package t1 is in location l1_5", but t1 is a truck. So perhaps that's a mistake. Let me recheck the original state:

Original state:

"Package t1 is in location l1_5"

"Package t2 is in location l2_5"

"Package p1 is in location l1_3"

"Package p2 is in location l1_3"

"Package a1 is in location l1_1"

"Package a2 is in location l2_1"

Wait, this seems wrong. Because t1 and t2 are trucks, a1 and a2 are airplanes. But the user listed them as packages. That must be a mistake. So the actual initial positions are:

Truck t1 is in l1_5.

Truck t2 is in l2_5.

Airplane a1 is in l1_1.

Airplane a2 is in l2_1.

But the user wrote "Package t1 is in location l1_5" — that's incorrect. But given that the user provided the problem, I have to take it as given. So according to the problem statement, t1, t2, a1, a2 are all packages? But the problem says "the world includes the following objects: trucks t1, t2; airplanes a1, a2; packages p1, p2." So t1 and t2 are trucks, a1 and a2 are airplanes, p1 and p2 are packages. So the original state must have a typo. The correct initial positions should be:

Truck t1 is in l1_5.

Truck t2 is in l2_5.

Airplane a1 is in l1_1.

Airplane a2 is in l2_1.

But according to the problem statement's original state, it's written as "Package t1 is in l1_5" etc. So this is an error. But since we have to work with what's given, perhaps the user intended that the trucks and airplanes are in those locations. So let's proceed under the assumption that the original state has a typo, and that:

Truck t1 is in l1_5.

Truck t2 is in l2_5.

Airplane a1 is in l1_1.

Airplane a2 is in l2_1.

Similarly, the packages p1 and p2 are in l1_3.

So the initial positions:

- t1 (truck) is at l1_5 (city c1).

- t2 (truck) is at l2_5 (city c2).

- a1 (airplane) is at l1_1 (city c1's airport).

- a2 (airplane) is at l2_1 (city c2's airport).

- p1 and p2 are at l1_3 (city c1).

Now, the goal is to have p1 and p2 in l1_3, which is already their initial position. But the constraints require that during the plan, the three conditions are met.

So the plan must involve moving p2 to satisfy the constraints, then return it to l1_3. Similarly for p1 if needed.

Let's tackle each constraint.

Constraint 1: At some state, p2 is in a1 or l2_5.

Option 1: Move p2 to l2_5. But l2_5 is in city c2. So how to get there? Since p2 starts in c1's l1_3. To get to c2, need to fly it via airplane. Let's see. The steps could be:

- Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_3 (since t1 is in l1_5, which is in c1, and l1_3 is in c1). Then load p2 into t1, drive to l1_1 (the airport in c1), unload p2, load into a1, fly a1 to l2_1 (c2's airport), unload p2 into t2 (which is at l2_5? No, t2 is at l2_5. Wait, no. t2 is a truck in city c2. Locations in c2 are l2_1 (airport), l2_2 to l2_5. So t2 is in l2_5. So to get p2 to l2_5, maybe:

After flying to l2_1, unload p2 from a1, load into t2 (but t2 is at l2_5. So need to drive t2 to l2_1 first? Because t2 is in l2_5, to get to l2_1, drive through c2's locations. So drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 via drivetruck actions. Then load p2 into t2, then drive back to l2_5. Then unload p2 there. That would satisfy constraint 1 (p2 in l2_5). Alternatively, maybe a simpler path. But this might take a lot of steps.

Alternatively, load p2 into a1 (so during the plan, p2 is in a1, satisfying constraint 1). So how to do that. Let's see:

- To load p2 into a1, which is at l1_1. So need to get p2 to l1_1.

Since p2 is in l1_3, use a truck to move it to l1_1. So:

1. Drivetruck t1 from l1_5 to l1_3 (city c1). Then load p2 into t1. Then drive t1 to l1_1. Then unload p2 at l1_1. Then load p2 into a1. Then, perhaps unload it again. But the constraint is just that at some point, p2 is in a1. So if we load p2 into a1, then unload it immediately, that would satisfy constraint 1. But then we need to get p2 back to l1_3.

Alternatively, maybe after loading p2 into a1, fly a1 to another airport (like l2_1), then unload p2 there, but then we need to get it back. This could complicate things, but let's see.

But let's think about the constraints first.

Constraint 1 can be satisfied by loading p2 into a1 (so at that point, p2 is in a1). Then, to satisfy constraint 3, we need p2 to be in l2_4 or a2. So maybe after flying a1 to l2_1, unload p2 into a2 (which is in l2_1). Then a2 is in l2_1, so loading p2 into a2 would put p2 in a2, satisfying constraint 3. Then, fly a2 somewhere else, unload p2, and bring it back.

But this is getting complicated. Let's outline possible steps.

First, handle constraint 1: get p2 into a1 or l2_5.

Option 1: Load p2 into a1.

Steps:

1. Move truck t1 (in l1_5) to l1_3: drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1.

2. Load p2 into t1: loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3.

3. Drive t1 to l1_1: drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1.

4. Unload p2 from t1 to l1_1: unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

5. Load p2 into a1: loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1. Now, p2 is in a1. This satisfies constraint 1.

Then, to satisfy constraint 3, which requires p2 in l2_4 or a2. Let's choose a2.

6. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1: flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1.

7. Unload p2 from a1 into l2_1: unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1. Now p2 is in l2_1.

8. Load p2 into a2 (which is at l2_1): loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1. Now p2 is in a2, satisfying constraint 3.

Then, need to get p2 back to l1_3. So fly a2 back to l1_1? But a2 is in l2_1, which is city c2's airport. To fly to l1_1 (c1's airport), that's allowed. So:

9. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1: flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

10. Unload p2 from a2 to l1_1: unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1.

11. Load p2 into t1 (which is at l1_1): loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

12. Drive t1 to l1_3: drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1.

13. Unload p2 at l1_3: unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3. Now p2 is back.

But during this process, we also need to handle constraint 2: "p1 is in t2 or p2 is in l2_3".

In the steps above, p2 is in a2 (l2_1 after step 9?), but maybe not l2_3. So perhaps during the plan, we need to ensure that either p1 is in t2 or p2 is in l2_3. Let's see.

In the current steps, we have p2 in l2_1 (step 7), then loaded into a2 (step 8), flown to l1_1 (step9), unloaded (step10), etc. So p2 is never in l2_3. So we need to satisfy constraint 2 either by getting p1 into t2 or p2 into l2_3.

Option: Take p1 into t2. But t2 is in city c2 (l2_5). So how to get p1 there? That would require transporting p1 from c1 to c2. Let's see.

Alternatively, during the process, maybe drive t2 to l2_3 and leave p2 there. But how? Let's see:

Wait, in step 7, p2 is unloaded at l2_1. Then we could use t2 (which is in l2_5) to move p2 to l2_3. So:

After step7 (p2 in l2_1), drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2).

Then load p2 into t2, drive to l2_3, unload p2 there. That would put p2 in l2_3, satisfying constraint 2. Then proceed to load into a2, etc.

Let me adjust the steps:

After step7 (p2 is in l2_1):

7a. Drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2.

7b. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.

7c. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2.

7d. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3. Now p2 is in l2_3, satisfying constraint 2 (since p2 is in l2_3).

Then proceed to load p2 into t2 again, drive to l2_1, load into a2, etc.

But this adds more steps. Let's see:

So steps would be:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1.

2. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3.

3. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1.

4. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

5. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1. (constraint1 met)

6. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1.

7. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1.

8. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2.

9. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.

10. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2.

11. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3. (constraint2 met)

12. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2.

13. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.

14. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1. (now p2 is back in l2_1)

15. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1. (constraint3 met: p2 in a2)

16. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

17. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1.

18. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

19. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1.

20. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3.

But this seems very long. Also, we have to consider that p1 is still in l1_3. So during all this, p1 hasn't moved, so it's still in l1_3. The goal is already satisfied, but the constraints are met during the steps.

But wait, the problem states that the initial state already satisfies the goal. However, the constraints must be met during the plan. So even if the initial state is the goal, the plan must perform actions to meet the constraints. But since the initial state is the goal, but the constraints are not met in the initial state, the plan must involve moving the packages to satisfy the constraints and then return them to their original positions.

But perhaps the initial plan would be to move p2, satisfy all constraints, and bring it back. However, p1 is in l1_3 throughout. So to meet constraint2, which requires "p1 is in t2 or p2 is in l2_3". If p2 is moved to l2_3 (step 11), then constraint2 is satisfied. So in that case, the steps above would handle constraints 1, 2, 3.

Now, the plan would be:

1. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_3.

2. Load p2 into t1.

3. Drive t1 to l1_1.

4. Unload p2 at l1_1.

5. Load p2 into a1. (constraint1 met here)

6. Fly a1 to l2_1.

7. Unload p2 from a1.

8. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1.

9. Load p2 into t2.

10. Drive t2 to l2_3.

11. Unload p2 in l2_3. (constraint2 met here)

12. Drive t2 back to l2_1.

13. Load p2 into t2.

14. Unload p2 at l2_1.

15. Load p2 into a2. (constraint3 met here)

16. Fly a2 to l1_1.

17. Unload p2 from a2.

18. Load p2 into t1.

19. Drive t1 back to l1_3.

20. Unload p2 into l1_3.

But this is a long plan. Maybe there's a shorter way. Let's see.

Alternative approach: Maybe satisfy multiple constraints with the same action.

For example, when p2 is loaded into a2 (constraint3), and during that step, maybe p2 is in l2_4 at some point. But l2_4 is a location in c2. How to get there?

Alternatively, after getting p2 into a2, fly to l2_4 (but airports are only l2_1). Because airplanes can only land at airports, right? Because the problem states: "each city may include multiple locations. One location of each city is an airport." So airplanes can only fly between airports. So to get to l2_4 (which is a non-airport location), you can't fly there. You have to fly to the airport (l2_1) and then use a truck. So to get p2 to l2_4, you'd need to drive a truck from l2_1 to l2_4.

So if we need to satisfy constraint3 (p2 in l2_4 or a2), putting p2 in a2 would satisfy it. So step15 (load into a2) satisfies constraint3.

So the steps above do satisfy all constraints. But the plan is quite long. Let's check if there's a shorter path.

Wait, what if we fly p2 from l1_1 to l2_1, then load into a2 (satisfying constraint3), and during transportation, maybe satisfy constraint2 by driving t2 to l2_3. Let me see:

Alternative plan:

1. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_3.

2. Load p2 into t1.

3. Drive t1 to l1_1.

4. Unload p2 at l1_1.

5. Load p2 into a1. (constraint1 met)

6. Fly a1 to l2_1.

7. Unload p2 into l2_1.

8. Load p2 into a2. (constraint3 met)

At this point, p2 is in a2. Then fly a2 to l1_1, unload, and return to l1_3.

But how to handle constraint2: p1 in t2 or p2 in l2_3. In this case, p2 hasn't been to l2_3. So we need to get p2 to l2_3. So maybe after step7:

7. Unload p2 into l2_1.

8. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1.

9. Load p2 into t2.

10. Drive t2 to l2_3.

11. Unload p2 there. (constraint2 met)

12. Load p2 into t2 again.

13. Drive back to l2_1.

14. Load into a2. (constraint3)

Then fly back.

This seems similar to the earlier plan. So whether we load into a2 before or after moving to l2_3, but the steps are needed.

Alternatively, can we use p1 to satisfy constraint2? But p1 is in l1_3. To get p1 into t2 (which is in c2), we need to move p1 to c2. That would require:

1. Load p1 into a truck in c1, drive to airport, load into airplane, fly to c2, unload, load into t2.

But this is even more steps and would complicate things. So it's better to satisfy constraint2 by putting p2 in l2_3.

So the initial plan seems necessary.

But the problem requires the plan to be optimal, i.e., shortest possible. Let's see if there's a way to combine some steps.

For example, after step5 (p2 in a1), fly a1 to l2_1 (step6). Then unload p2 (step7). Then drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (step8), load p2 into t2 (step9), drive to l2_3 (step10), unload (step11), which satisfies constraint2. Then drive t2 to l2_1 (step12), load into a2 (step13), fly a2 to l1_1 (step14), unload (step15), load into t1 (step16), drive to l1_3 (step17), unload (step18). That's 18 steps. But perhaps some steps can be optimized.

Wait, after step11 (unload p2 in l2_3), instead of driving back to l2_1, maybe we can fly a2 to l2_3's airport? No, because airports are only l2_1. So to get p2 into a2, we need to be at l2_1. So after step11, p2 is in l2_3. To get it into a2 (which is in l2_1), we need to move p2 back to l2_1. So steps would be:

12. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1.

13. Load p2 into t2.

14. Unload p2 into l2_1.

But wait, no. Wait, after step11, p2 is in l2_3. So steps:

12. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1 (but t2 is already in l2_3 after step10. Wait, no. After step10, t2 is driven to l2_3. So after step11 (unload), t2 is still in l2_3. So step12 would be drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2.

13. Then load p2 into t2 again? But p2 is in l2_3. So we need to load p2 into t2 at l2_3.

Wait, after step11, p2 is in l2_3. So to move it to l2_1, need to load into t2 at l2_3, drive to l2_1, unload.

So steps would be:

12. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3.

13. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2.

14. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.

Now p2 is in l2_1 again. Then load into a2 (step15), fly back.

So the steps would be:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1

2. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

3. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1

4. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

5. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (constraint1)

6. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

7. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

8. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2

9. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

10. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2

11. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (constraint2)

12. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3

13. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

14. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

15. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (constraint3)

16. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

17. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

18. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

19. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1

20. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

That's 20 steps. That's a lot, but perhaps it's necessary. However, maybe there's a shorter way.

Wait, after step11 (unload p2 in l2_3), can we then load p2 into t2 again (step12) and drive to l2_4 instead of l2_1? Because constraint3 requires p2 in l2_4 or a2. If we drive to l2_4 and unload there, that would satisfy constraint3.

So steps:

After step11 (unload in l2_3):

12. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3

13. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2

14. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (constraint3 met)

15. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2

16. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

17. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

18. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

19. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

20. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

21. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

22. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1

23. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

But this is even longer. So it's better to load into a2, satisfying constraint3.

Alternatively, during step14, after loading into a2, constraint3 is met. So steps can be:

1. Drive t1 to l1_3.

2. Load p2.

3. Drive to l1_1.

4. Unload.

5. Load into a1. (constraint1)

6. Fly to l2_1.

7. Unload.

8. Drive t2 to l2_1.

9. Load p2 into t2.

10. Drive to l2_3.

11. Unload. (constraint2)

12. Load p2 into t2.

13. Drive to l2_1.

14. Unload.

15. Load into a2. (constraint3)

16. Fly to l1_1.

17. Unload.

18. Load into t1.

19. Drive to l1_3.

20. Unload.

That's 20 steps. Is there a way to avoid some steps? For example, can we avoid driving t2 back to l2_1 after unloading in l2_3 by using another truck? But there's only t2 in c2.

Alternatively, can we have p2 in a2 without driving back to l2_1? No, because airplanes are only at airports.

So the steps are necessary.

But wait, after step11, when p2 is in l2_3, can we load it into a2 directly? No, because a2 is at l2_1. So we need to bring p2 back to l2_1 to load into a2.

Alternatively, maybe fly a2 to l2_3? No, because airplanes can only fly between airports, which are l1_1 and l2_1. So a2 can't go to l2_3.

Therefore, the plan must include those steps.

Now, check if all constraints are met:

- constraint1: step5 (p2 in a1).

- constraint2: step11 (p2 in l2_3).

- constraint3: step15 (p2 in a2).

All met. The plan is valid, and the goal is achieved.

Now, the initial plan is 20 steps, but maybe there's a shorter path.

Wait, what if after step5 (p2 in a1), we fly a1 to l2_1, unload p2 into l2_1, then load into a2 (which is in l2_1). Now, p2 is in a2 (constraint3). Then fly a2 to l2_5? No, airplanes can't go to non-airports. So fly a2 to l1_1, unload p2, then drive back to l1_3.

But in this case, constraint2 (p2 in l2_3 or p1 in t2) is not met. So this would not satisfy constraint2. So we need to ensure that constraint2 is met.

Thus, the earlier plan is necessary.

Is there a way to satisfy constraint2 by moving p1 instead?

Constraint2: p1 in t2 or p2 in l2_3.

To get p1 into t2, which is in city c2, we need to transport p1 from c1 to c2. Let's see:

Steps for p1:

1. Drive t1 to l1_3, load p1.

2. Drive to l1_1.

3. Unload p1.

4. Load into a1.

5. Fly to l2_1.

6. Unload p1.

7. Drive t2 to l2_1.

8. Load p1 into t2. Now, p1 is in t2 (constraint2 met).

Then, drive t2 to l2_5, unload p1, then load into a2, fly back. But this requires additional steps.

But this would require moving p1, which is in the initial position. So after moving p1, we have to return it to l1_3.

But this adds more steps. So the total steps for handling p1 would be:

For p1:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1.

2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3.

3. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1.

4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1.

5. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1.

6. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1.

7. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1.

8. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2.

9. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1. (constraint2 met)

10. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2.

11. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5.

12. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_5. But a2 is in l2_1, so need to drive t2 back to l2_1. Hmm, no, this is getting complicated. To get p1 back to l1_3:

After step9, p1 is in t2. To return it:

10. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2.

11. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5.

12. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_5. But a2 is in l2_1. So need to fly a2 to l2_5? No, airplanes can only land at airports. So a2 is in l2_1. So need to drive t2 to l2_1 again, load p1 into a2, fly back.

This is getting too long. So it's better to handle constraint2 by moving p2 to l2_3 instead of moving p1.

Thus, the initial plan with 20 steps is required.

But wait, maybe there's a way to combine some actions. For example, after step5 (load p2 into a1), we can fly to l2_1 and unload, then load into a2 in the same location. But that would satisfy constraint3 (p2 in a2), but still need to handle constraint2.

Alternatively, during the same trip, after unloading p2 in l2_1, drive t2 to l2_3 and unload there.

But let's try to count steps again, perhaps with some optimization.

Revised plan:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1

2. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

3. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1

4. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

5. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (constraint1)

6. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

7. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

8. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2

9. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

10. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2

11. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (constraint2)

12. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

13. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

14. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

15. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (constraint3)

16. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

17. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

18. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

19. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1

20. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

This is 20 steps. Now, is there a way to avoid some steps?

For example, after step11 (p2 in l2_3), instead of driving t2 back to l2_1, could we load p2 into t2 there and drive directly to l2_4 to satisfy constraint3 (p2 in l2_4)?

Yes:

12. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3

13. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2

14. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (constraint3)

15. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2

16. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

17. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

18. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

19. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

20. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

21. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

22. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1

23. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

This adds more steps (23), so it's worse. So the original plan is better.

Alternatively, after step11 (p2 in l2_3), can we fly a2 to l2_3? No, because airplanes can only land at airports.

Thus, the initial plan of 20 steps seems necessary.

But wait, when we fly a2 back to l1_1, unload p2, then load into t1 and drive back to l1_3. But why not use the same airplane a1 to fly p2 back? Maybe not, because a1 is in l2_1 after step6. So after step6, a1 is in l2_1. So to fly p2 back, we can use a1 or a2.

But in the current plan, we use a2 to fly p2 back. Alternatively, use a1:

After step6, a1 is in l2_1. So after step7 (unload p2 from a1), we can load p2 into a1 again, fly back.

But how:

After step7 (p2 in l2_1):

8. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

9. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1

10. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

Then proceed to load into t1 and drive back. But this would require loading into a1 again, which is possible. But this would not satisfy constraint3 (p2 in a2 or l2_4). So unless we can also put p2 into a2.

Alternatively, after step7, load p2 into a2 (which is in l2_1):

8. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (constraint3)

9. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

10. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

Then load into t1 and drive back. But then, how to satisfy constraint2 (p2 in l2_3 or p1 in t2). So this approach skips the steps involving t2 and l2_3, thus not satisfying constraint2. Therefore, we still need to move p2 to l2_3.

So the earlier plan is necessary.

Therefore, the optimal plan must include all steps to move p2 to a1, then to l2_3, then to a2, and back. The total steps are 20, but perhaps there's a shorter way.

Wait, let's think differently. Can we satisfy multiple constraints in one move?

For example, when p2 is in a2, that satisfies constraint3. If during that time, we also have p2 in a1 (which satisfies constraint1), but that's not possible. Or perhaps using different parts of the journey.

Alternatively, after loading p2 into a1 (step5), fly to l2_1 (step6), unload (step7), then load into a2 (step15), which would satisfy constraint1 (p2 in a1) and constraint3 (p2 in a2). Then, drive p2 to l2_3 to satisfy constraint2. But then p2 is in a2, then unloaded, driven to l2_3.

But this would require:

After step15 (p2 in a2), fly a2 to l2_1. Wait, but a2 is already in l2_1. So perhaps:

After step7 (p2 in l2_1), load into a2 (step8), which satisfies constraint3.

Then fly a2 to l2_1 to l1_1 (step9), unload (step10), load into t1 (step11), drive to l1_3 (step12), unload (step13). But then constraint2 is not met.

Thus, the plan must include moving p2 to l2_3, which requires the steps involving t2.

So the conclusion is that the plan must be as follows to satisfy all constraints and return p2 to l1_3.

But the user wants the optimal (shortest) plan. So perhaps there's a way to reduce steps.

Wait, after step5 (p2 in a1), fly a1 to l2_1 (step6), unload (step7). Then drive t2 to l2_1 (step8), load p2 into t2 (step9), drive to l2_3 (step10), unload (step11) (constraint2 met). Then drive back to l2_1 (step12), load into a2 (step13) (constraint3), fly a2 to l1_1 (step14), unload (step15), load into t1 (step16), drive to l1_3 (step17), unload (step18). That's 18 steps.

Wait, let's count:

1. Drive t1 to l1_3.

2. Load p2.

3. Drive to l1_1.

4. Unload.

5. Load into a1. (constraint1)

6. Fly to l2_1.

7. Unload.

8. Drive t2 to l2_1.

9. Load p2.

10. Drive to l2_3.

11. Unload. (constraint2)

12. Drive t2 back to l2_1.

13. Load p2.

14. Unload.

15. Load into a2. (constraint3)

16. Fly to l1_1.

17. Unload.

18. Load into t1.

19. Drive to l1_3.

20. Unload.

Wait, no. From step12, after driving back to l2_1, you need to unload p2 (step14), but how? Because after step11, p2 is in l2_3. So after step11, to get p2 back to l2_1, you have to load it into t2 again.

So after step11:

12. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3.

13. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2.

14. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.

15. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1. (constraint3)

16. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

17. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1.

18. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

19. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1.

20. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3.

That's 20 steps. So the earlier count was correct.

But maybe there's a way to avoid unloading and loading again. For example, after step9 (p2 loaded into t2 at l2_1), drive to l2_3 (step10), unload (step11) (constraint2), then drive to l2_4 (step12), unload there (step13) (constraint3), then drive to l2_1 (step14), load into a2 (step15), fly back. But this adds steps.

Alternatively, after step11 (p2 in l2_3), load into t2 again (step12), drive to l2_4 (step13), unload (step14) (constraint3), then drive to l2_1 (step15), load into a2 (step16), fly back.

This would be:

1. Drive t1 to l1_3.

2. Load p2.

3. Drive to l1_1.

4. Unload.

5. Load into a1. (1)

6. Fly to l2_1.

7. Unload.

8. Drive t2 to l2_1.

9. Load p2.

10. Drive to l2_3.

11. Unload. (2)

12. Load p2.

13. Drive to l2_4.

14. Unload. (3)

15. Drive to l2_1.

16. Load p2.

17. Unload.

18. Load into a2.

19. Fly to l1_1.

20. Unload.

21. Load into t1.

22. Drive to l1_3.

23. Unload.

This is even longer.

Thus, the minimal steps are 20. However, maybe there's a smarter way.

Wait, what if we use a2 to fly p2 from l2_3 to l2_1? No, airplanes can't fly to non-airports.

Another angle: Can the constraints be satisfied in overlapping steps?

For example, when p2 is loaded into a2 (step15), which satisfies constraint3, and during the same plan, it's also in l2_3 (step11). But they're different states. Each constraint must be true in at least one state, not necessarily the same.

So the plan must include steps where each of the constraints is met in at least one state.

Thus, the initial plan is valid.

But given the problem's requirement to provide an optimal plan with minimal steps, I need to check if there's a shorter way.

Another approach: What if we load p2 into a1 (satisfy constraint1), then fly to l2_1, unload, then load into t2, drive to l2_5 (original location of t2), unload (satisfy constraint1 again, but l2_5 is one of the options). Wait, constraint1 is "p2 in a1 or l2_5". If p2 is unloaded in l2_5, that satisfies constraint1. So maybe:

After step7 (unload p2 in l2_1), drive t2 to l2_1 (step8), load p2 into t2 (step9), drive to l2_5 (step10), unload (step11). Now, p2 is in l2_5 (satisfies constraint1). Then, to satisfy constraint3 (p2 in a2 or l2_4), maybe drive to l2_4 (step12), unload (step13). Then drive back to l2_1 (step14), load into a2 (step15), fly back.

But this also requires multiple steps. Let's count:

1. Drive t1 to l1_3.

2. Load p2.

3. Drive to l1_1.

4. Unload.

5. Load into a1. (constraint1)

6. Fly to l2_1.

7. Unload.

8. Drive t2 to l2_1.

9. Load p2.

10. Drive to l2_5.

11. Unload. (constraint1 again)

12. Drive t2 to l2_4.

13. Unload. (constraint3)

14. Drive to l2_1.

15. Load p2.

16. Unload.

17. Load into a2. (constraint3 again)

18. Fly to l1_1.

19. Unload.

20. Load into t1.

21. Drive to l1_3.

22. Unload.

But this is 22 steps, longer than before. Also, constraint2 isn't met here. So this approach doesn't satisfy constraint2.

Thus, the initial plan remains the shortest.

After careful analysis, the optimal plan requires 20 steps. But perhaps there's a way to optimize further.

Wait, after step11 (unload p2 in l2_3), instead of driving back to l2_1, can we load p2 into a different airplane or truck? But there's only a2 in l2_1. So no.

Alternatively, after step11, leave p2 in l2_3 and bring it back via another path. But that would require additional steps.

Another thought: The problem requires that the final goal is for p1 and p2 to be in l1_3. Since they are already there, perhaps some steps are redundant. For example, after moving p2 out and back, but the initial state already has them there. But the constraints require intermediate steps.

However, the user's problem states that the initial state has p1 and p2 in l1_3, and the goal is the same. So technically, the empty plan would achieve the goal, but the constraints are not met. Hence, we need to perform actions that satisfy the constraints and return to the initial state.

Therefore, the plan must involve moving p2 out and back, satisfying the constraints along the way.

Given all that, the shortest valid plan is 20 steps as outlined earlier.

But I'm wondering if there's a way to reduce steps by combining some actions. For example, after step5 (p2 in a1), fly to l2_1 (step6), unload (step7), then load into a2 (step15). Then fly back. But this skips the steps involving constraint2.

Alternatively, if we can satisfy constraint2 via another route.

Constraint2: p1 in t2 or p2 in l2_3.

If we can put p1 in t2, then we don't need to move p2 to l2_3.

So, could we move p1 to t2, which is in c2. Let's see:

To put p1 in t2:

1. Drive t1 to l1_3, load p1.

2. Drive to l1_1.

3. Unload p1.

4. Load into a1.

5. Fly to l2_1.

6. Unload p1.

7. Drive t2 to l2_1.

8. Load p1 into t2. (constraint2 met)

9. Drive t2 to l2_5.

10. Unload p1.

Then fly p1 back to l1_1, load into t1, drive to l1_3.

But this would require:

Steps for p1:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1.

2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3.

3. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1.

4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1.

5. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1.

6. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1.

7. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1.

8. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2.

9. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1. (constraint2 met)

10. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2.

11. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5.

12. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_5. (But a2 is in l2_1, so this is impossible. So we need to drive t2 back to l2_1.

13. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2.

14. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1.

15. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

16. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1.

17. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1.

18. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1.

19. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3.

But this is 19 steps for p1, plus steps for p2 to satisfy other constraints.

But p2 must also be moved to satisfy constraints1 and3.

Thus, total steps would be:

For p1: 19 steps.

For p2: steps to satisfy constraints1 and3.

But this would be even longer than the previous plan.

Therefore, the initial plan of 20 steps for p2 alone (since p1 stays in l1_3) is better.

Thus, the optimal plan is the one where we move p2 through the required locations to satisfy all constraints and return it to l1_3, resulting in 20 steps.

However, upon reviewing the problem statement again, I notice that the user mentioned "the original state of the world" lists "Package t1 is in location l1_5", etc. This seems to be a mistake, as t1 is a truck, not a package. However, we must adhere to the given problem as stated, treating trucks and airplanes as packages. Wait, no. The world includes trucks and airplanes as distinct objects. So the original state must have a typo, but we need to correct it mentally. For example, "Package t1 is in location l1_5" should be "Truck t1 is in location l1_5". Similarly for others. Otherwise, the problem doesn't make sense. So I'll proceed under the assumption that those are the initial positions of the trucks and airplanes, not packages.

Thus, the initial state is:

Truck t1 is at l1_5.

Truck t2 is at l2_5.

Airplane a1 is at l1_1.

Airplane a2 is at l2_1.

Packages p1 and p2 are at l1_3.

This correction is crucial for the plan to make sense.

With that in mind, the steps are:

1. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_3.

2. Load p2 into t1.

3. Drive t1 to l1_1.

4. Unload p2 at l1_1.

5. Load p2 into a1. (constraint1)

6. Fly a1 to l2_1.

7. Unload p2 at l2_1.

8. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1.

9. Load p2 into t2.

10. Drive t2 to l2_3.

11. Unload p2 at l2_3. (constraint2)

12. Load p2 into t2.

13. Drive t2 back to l2_1.

14. Unload p2 at l2_1.

15. Load p2 into a2. (constraint3)

16. Fly a2 to l1_1.

17. Unload p2 at l1_1.

18. Load p2 into t1.

19. Drive t1 back to l1_3.

20. Unload p2 at l1_3.

Thus, the final plan is 20 steps.
