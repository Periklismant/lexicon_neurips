Let me go through this planning problem step by step.

First, let me understand the initial state of the world:

- Locations l1_1, l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5 are in city c1
- Locations l2_1, l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5 are in city c2
- l1_1 and l2_1 are airports
- Package p1 is in location l1_3
- Package p2 is in location l1_3
- Truck t1 is in location l1_5
- Truck t2 is in location l2_5
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

Wait, I see a potential inconsistency. The state says:
```
"Package t1 is in location l1_5"
"Package t2 is in location l2_5"
```
But t1 and t2 are trucks, not packages. Let me re-interpret this as:
```
"Truck t1 is in location l1_5"
"Truck t2 is in location l2_5"
```

Similarly:
```
"Package a1 is in location l1_1"
"Package a2 is in location l2_1"
```
Should be:
```
"Airplane a1 is in location l1_1"
"Airplane a2 is in location l2_1"
```

Now, let's look at the goal:
- Package p1 is in location l1_3
- Package p2 is in location l1_3

Interestingly, the packages are already in the right location! Both p1 and p2 are already in l1_3. So, the goal is already satisfied. However, there are constraints that need to be satisfied:

1. At least one of the following must be true in at least one state:
   - Package p2 is in a1
   - Package p2 is in location l2_5

2. At least one of the following must be true in at least one state:
   - Package p1 is in t2
   - Package p2 is in location l2_3

3. At least one of the following must be true in at least one state:
   - Package p2 is in location l2_4
   - Package p2 is in a2

So, we need to plan a sequence of actions that satisfy these constraints and then return the packages to their original location (l1_3).

Let's start by figuring out how to satisfy constraint 1. We can either put p2 in airplane a1 or move p2 to location l2_5. Let's consider these options:

Option 1: Move p2 to a1
- Move t1 from l1_5 to l1_3 (where p2 is)
- Load p2 onto t1
- Drive t1 to l1_1 (the airport)
- Unload p2 at l1_1
- Load p2 onto a1

Option 2: Move p2 to l2_5
- Move t1 from l1_5 to l1_3 (where p2 is)
- Load p2 onto t1
- Drive t1 to l1_1 (the airport)
- Unload p2 at l1_1
- Load p2 onto a1
- Fly a1 to l2_1 (another airport)
- Unload p2 at l2_1
- Move t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (if needed)
- Load p2 onto t2
- Drive t2 to l2_5
- Unload p2 at l2_5

Looking at these options, Option 1 is simpler and achieves the same goal. So, let's go with that.

Now, for constraint 2, we need one of:
- Package p1 is in t2
- Package p2 is in location l2_3

For the first, we'd need to move p1 from l1_3 to t2, which is in city c2. For the second, we'd need to move p2 to l2_3, also in city c2. Let's consider these options:

Option 1: Move p1 to t2
- Move t1 from l1_5 to l1_3 (where p1 is)
- Load p1 onto t1
- Drive t1 to l1_1 (the airport)
- Unload p1 at l1_1
- Load p1 onto a1
- Fly a1 to l2_1 (another airport)
- Unload p1 at l2_1
- Move t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (if needed)
- Load p1 onto t2

Option 2: Move p2 to l2_3
- Move t1 from l1_5 to l1_3 (where p2 is)
- Load p2 onto t1
- Drive t1 to l1_1 (the airport)
- Unload p2 at l1_1
- Load p2 onto a1
- Fly a1 to l2_1 (another airport)
- Unload p2 at l2_1
- Move t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (if needed)
- Load p2 onto t2
- Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_3
- Unload p2 at l2_3

For constraint 3, we need one of:
- Package p2 is in location l2_4
- Package p2 is in a2

Both of these involve moving p2 to city c2.

Option 1: Move p2 to l2_4
- The beginning would be similar to the previous options for moving p2 to c2.
- Drive t2 from l2_3 (or wherever it is) to l2_4
- Unload p2 at l2_4

Option 2: Move p2 to a2
- Move t1 from l1_5 to l1_3 (where p2 is)
- Load p2 onto t1
- Drive t1 to l1_1 (the airport)
- Unload p2 at l1_1
- Load p2 onto a1
- Fly a1 to l2_1 (another airport)
- Unload p2 at l2_1
- Load p2 onto a2 (which is already at l2_1)

After satisfying all the constraints, we need to ensure that both p1 and p2 are back in l1_3 (the original goal).

It seems like we can combine some of these steps. For example, after moving p2 to different locations in city c2, we can eventually move it back to city c1, location l1_3. Similarly, if we move p1 for satisfying constraint 2, we need to ensure it's back in l1_3 eventually.

Let's lay out a possible plan. I'll focus on satisfying the constraints in a manner that minimizes the total number of steps:

1. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_3 (to pick up p2)
2. Load p2 onto t1 in l1_3
3. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1 (the airport)
4. Unload p2 from t1 in l1_1
5. Load p2 onto a1 in l1_1 (this satisfies constraint 1, first option)
6. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1 (airport in city c2)
7. Unload p2 from a1 in l2_1
8. Load p2 onto a2 in l2_1 (this satisfies constraint 3, second option)
9. Unload p2 from a2 in l2_1
10. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (to pick up p2)
11. Load p2 onto t2 in l2_1
12. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_3
13. Unload p2 from t2 in l2_3 (this satisfies constraint 2, second option)
14. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_4
15. Load p2 onto t2 in l2_4
16. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1 (the airport)
17. Unload p2 from t2 in l2_1
18. Load p2 onto a1 in l2_1
19. Fly a1 from l2_1 to l1_1
20. Unload p2 from a1 in l1_1
21. Load p2 onto t1 in l1_1
22. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_3
23. Unload p2 from t1 in l1_3

This plan satisfies all the constraints and returns p2 to l1_3. However, it seems like this is a lot of steps, and I'm not entirely convinced it's the most efficient plan.

Wait actually, I think there's an issue with my plan. I've been overlooking the fact that p1 is still in l1_3. If p1 isn't moved, then constraint 2 (option 1: "Package p1 is in t2") can't be satisfied.

Let's reconsider our approach:

To satisfy all the constraints, we can:
1. Satisfy constraint 2, option 1: Move p1 to t2.
2. Satisfy constraint 1, option 1: Move p2 to a1.
3. Satisfy constraint 3, option 1: Move p2 to l2_4.
4. Return both p1 and p2 to l1_3.

Let's try to make a more efficient plan:

1. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_3 (to pick up p2)
2. Load p2 onto t1 in l1_3
3. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1 (the airport)
4. Unload p2 from t1 in l1_1
5. Load p2 onto a1 in l1_1 (this satisfies constraint 1, option 1)
6. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_3 (to pick up p1)
7. Load p1 onto t1 in l1_3
8. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1 (the airport)
9. Unload p1 from t1 in l1_1
10. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1 (airport in city c2)
11. Unload p2 from a1 in l2_1
12. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (to pick up both p1 and p2)
13. Load p1 onto t2 in l2_1 (this satisfies constraint 2, option 1)
14. Load p2 onto t2 in l2_1
15. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4
16. Unload p2 from t2 in l2_4 (this satisfies constraint 3, option 1)
17. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1 (the airport)
18. Unload p1 from t2 in l2_1
19. Load p1 onto a1 in l2_1
20. Load p2 onto t2 in l2_4 (previously unloaded there)
21. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1
22. Unload p2 from t2 in l2_1
23. Load p2 onto a1 in l2_1
24. Fly a1 from l2_1 to l1_1 (returning to city c1)
25. Unload p1 from a1 in l1_1
26. Unload p2 from a1 in l1_1
27. Load p1 onto t1 in l1_1
28. Load p2 onto t1 in l1_1
29. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_3
30. Unload p1 from t1 in l1_3
31. Unload p2 from t1 in l1_3

Hmm, this plan is still long. Let's take a step back and try to find a more efficient path by thinking about the constraints more carefully.

Actually, the constraints only require that the specified conditions are true at *some* point during the execution of the plan, not necessarily at the final state. The final goal is for both p1 and p2 to be in l1_3, which they already are at the beginning. So, we need to move them to satisfy the constraints and then return them to l1_3.

Let's see if we can identify a more efficient path:

Constraint 1 options:
- Option A: "Package p2 is in a1"
- Option B: "Package p2 is in location l2_5"

Constraint 2 options:
- Option A: "Package p1 is in t2"
- Option B: "Package p2 is in location l2_3"

Constraint 3 options:
- Option A: "Package p2 is in location l2_4"
- Option B: "Package p2 is in a2"

Given that we need to move packages to satisfy constraints and then return them, it makes sense to choose options that are on a common path, so we don't have to re-trace our steps as much. 

If we consider city 2, constraints 1B (p2 in l2_5), 2B (p2 in l2_3), and 3A (p2 in l2_4) all involve p2 being in city 2. Moreover, they all involve p2 being in different locations in city 2, so we could satisfy all of them by moving p2 from l2_5 to l2_3 to l2_4 (or in any other order).

So, let's devise a new plan:

1. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_3 (to pick up p2)
2. Load p2 onto t1 in l1_3
3. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1 (the airport)
4. Unload p2 from t1 in l1_1
5. Load p2 onto a1 in l1_1
6. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1 (airport in city c2)
7. Unload p2 from a1 in l2_1
8. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (to pick up p2)
9. Load p2 onto t2 in l2_1
10. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_5
11. Unload p2 from t2 in l2_5 (this satisfies constraint 1, option B)
12. Load p2 onto t2 in l2_5
13. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_3
14. Unload p2 from t2 in l2_3 (this satisfies constraint 2, option B)
15. Load p2 onto t2 in l2_3
16. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_4
17. Unload p2 from t2 in l2_4 (this satisfies constraint 3, option A)
18. Load p2 onto t2 in l2_4
19. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1 (the airport)
20. Unload p2 from t2 in l2_1
21. Load p2 onto a1 in l2_1
22. Fly a1 from l2_1 to l1_1
23. Unload p2 from a1 in l1_1
24. Load p2 onto t1 in l1_1
25. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_3
26. Unload p2 from t1 in l1_3

This is a cleaner plan, and I think it's more efficient than the previous ones. It still involves quite a few steps, but that's because we are satisfying multiple constraints by moving p2 to different locations in city 2.

However, I'm realizing that this plan doesn't satisfy constraint 2, option A ("Package p1 is in t2"). Let's see if we can include that in a more efficient manner.

Actually, I'm rethinking this. Let me count the steps in different scenarios to find the most efficient plan:

Scenario 1: Satisfy all constraints with p2 in city 2 (as in the last plan):
- Moving p2 from l1_3 to l2_1: 7 steps
- Satisfying constraints 1B, 2B, 3A: 11 steps
- Returning p2 to l1_3: 8 steps
Total: 26 steps

Scenario 2: Satisfy constraints with p1 in t2 and p2 in different locations:
- Moving p2 from l1_3 to a1: 5 steps (satisfies constraint 1, option A)
- Moving p1 from l1_3 to t2: 9 steps (satisfies constraint 2, option A)
- Moving p2 to a2: 3 steps (assuming p2 is already in a1 and a1 is at l2_1, satisfies constraint 3, option B)
- Returning both to l1_3: 10 steps (approximately)
Total: 27 steps

It seems like Scenario 1 might be slightly more efficient. Let me try to refine it a bit more:

1. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_3 (to pick up p2)
2. Load p2 onto t1 in l1_3
3. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1 (the airport)
4. Unload p2 from t1 in l1_1
5. Load p2 onto a1 in l1_1 (this satisfies constraint 1, option A)
6. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1 (airport in city c2)
7. Unload p2 from a1 in l2_1
8. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (to pick up p2)
9. Load p2 onto t2 in l2_1
10. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_3
11. Unload p2 from t2 in l2_3 (this satisfies constraint 2, option B)
12. Load p2 onto t2 in l2_3
13. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_4
14. Unload p2 from t2 in l2_4 (this satisfies constraint 3, option A)
15. Load p2 onto t2 in l2_4
16. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1 (the airport)
17. Unload p2 from t2 in l2_1
18. Load p2 onto a1 in l2_1
19. Fly a1 from l2_1 to l1_1
20. Unload p2 from a1 in l1_1
21. Load p2 onto t1 in l1_1
22. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_3
23. Unload p2 from t1 in l1_3

That's 23 steps. Let's try another approach:

1. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_3 (to pick up p2)
2. Load p2 onto t1 in l1_3
3. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1 (the airport)
4. Unload p2 from t1 in l1_1
5. Load p2 onto a1 in l1_1 (this satisfies constraint 1, option A)
6. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_3 (to pick up p1)
7. Load p1 onto t1 in l1_3
8. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1 (the airport)
9. Unload p1 from t1 in l1_1
10. Load p1 onto a1 in l1_1
11. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1 (airport in city c2)
12. Unload p2 from a1 in l2_1
13. Load p2 onto a2 in l2_1 (this satisfies constraint 3, option B)
14. Unload p1 from a1 in l2_1
15. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (to pick up p1)
16. Load p1 onto t2 in l2_1 (this satisfies constraint 2, option A)
17. Unload p2 from a2 in l2_1
18. Load p2 onto t2 in l2_1
19. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_3
20. Unload p2 from t2 in l2_3 (this satisfies constraint 2, option B as well)
21. Load p2 onto t2 in l2_3
22. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1 (the airport)
23. Unload p1 from t2 in l2_1
24. Unload p2 from t2 in l2_1
25. Load p1 onto a1 in l2_1
26. Load p2 onto a1 in l2_1
27. Fly a1 from l2_1 to l1_1
28. Unload p1 from a1 in l1_1
29. Unload p2 from a1 in l1_1
30. Load p1 onto t1 in l1_1
31. Load p2 onto t1 in l1_1
32. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_3
33. Unload p1 from t1 in l1_3
34. Unload p2 from t1 in l1_3

That's 34 steps! It seems like the efficient approach is to meet constraint 1 with p2 in a1, constraint 2 with p2 in l2_3, and constraint 3 with p2 in l2_4. The total steps for this would be around 23.

Here's the plan again:

1. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_3 (to pick up p2)
2. Load p2 onto t1 in l1_3
3. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1 (the airport)
4. Unload p2 from t1 in l1_1
5. Load p2 onto a1 in l1_1 (this satisfies constraint 1, option A)
6. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1 (airport in city c2)
7. Unload p2 from a1 in l2_1
8. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (to pick up p2)
9. Load p2 onto t2 in l2_1
10. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_3
11. Unload p2 from t2 in l2_3 (this satisfies constraint 2, option B)
12. Load p2 onto t2 in l2_3
13. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_4
14. Unload p2 from t2 in l2_4 (this satisfies constraint 3, option A)
15. Load p2 onto t2 in l2_4
16. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1 (the airport)
17. Unload p2 from t2 in l2_1
18. Load p2 onto a1 in l2_1
19. Fly a1 from l2_1 to l1_1
20. Unload p2 from a1 in l1_1
21. Load p2 onto t1 in l1_1
22. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_3
23. Unload p2 from t1 in l1_3

Wait, is this even a valid plan? Let me double-check. We want to end with both p1 and p2 in l1_3. We need to ensure this and satisfy all the constraints. p1 is already in l1_3 and never moves, which is valid because the goal is for it to be in l1_3. p2 is moved around to satisfy the constraints and is returned to l1_3.

Let's double-check the constraints again:

1. At least one of the following must be true in at least one state:
   - "Package p2 is in a1" (satisfied by step 5)
   - "Package p2 is in location l2_5"

2. At least one of the following must be true in at least one state:
   - "Package p1 is in t2"
   - "Package p2 is in location l2_3" (satisfied by step 11)

3. At least one of the following must be true in at least one state:
   - "Package p2 is in location l2_4" (satisfied by step 14)
   - "Package p2 is in a2"

So the plan satisfies all constraints. The goal is for both p1 and p2 to be in l1_3, which is the case at the end of our plan. I think this is valid.

Although wait a moment. Let's think if there is a way to reduce the number of steps even further. Could there be a more efficient path to satisfy these constraints? Let's try to create the absolute minimum path:

1. Move t1 from l1_5 to l1_3 (1 step)
2. Load p2 onto t1 (1 step)
3. Move t1 to l1_1 (1 step)
4. Unload p2 (1 step)
5. Load p2 onto a1 (satisfying constraint 1) (1 step)
6. Fly a1 to l2_1 (1 step)
7. Unload p2 (1 step)
8. Move t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (1 step)
9. Load p2 onto t2 (1 step)
10. Move t2 to l2_3 (1 step)
11. Unload p2 (satisfying constraint 2) (1 step)
12. Load p2 onto t2 (1 step)
13. Move t2 to l2_4 (1 step)
14. Unload p2 (satisfying constraint 3) (1 step)
15. Load p2 onto t2 (1 step)
16. Move t2 to l2_1 (1 step)
17. Unload p2 (1 step)
18. Load p2 onto a1 (1 step)
19. Fly a1 to l1_1 (1 step)
20. Unload p2 (1 step)
21. Load p2 onto t1 (1 step)
22. Move t1 to l1_3 (1 step)
23. Unload p2 (1 step)

So, 23 steps still. This seems like the most efficient plan for the given constraints.

Actually I realized there might be a further optimization. We have to decide where to satisfy constraint 1. We can either do:
- "Package p2 is in a1" (satisfied in step 5 in our current plan)
- "Package p2 is in location l2_5"

If we choose the latter, can we make the plan more efficient? Let's sketch it out.
1. Move t1 from l1_5 to l1_3 (1 step)
2. Load p2 onto t1 (1 step)
3. Move t1 to l1_1 (1 step)
4. Unload p2 (1 step)
5. Load p2 onto a1 (1 step)
6. Fly a1 to l2_1 (1 step)
7. Unload p2 (1 step)
8. Move t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (1 step)
9. Load p2 onto t2 (1 step)
10. Move t2 to l2_5 (satisfying constraint 1) (1 step)
11. Move t2 to l2_3 (satisfying constraint 2) (1 step)
12. Move t2 to l2_4 (satisfying constraint 3) (1 step)
13. Move t2 to l2_1 (1 step)
14. Unload p2 (1 step)
15. Load p2 onto a1 (1 step)
16. Fly a1 to l1_1 (1 step)
17. Unload p2 (1 step)
18. Load p2 onto t1 (1 step)
19. Move t1 to l1_3 (1 step)
20. Unload p2 (1 step)

Wait, I think I made a mistake here. In steps 10, 11, and 12, I'm assuming p2 is still in t2 to satisfy the constraints, but that would require unloading and loading actions. Let me recalculate:

1. Move t1 from l1_5 to l1_3 (1 step)
2. Load p2 onto t1 (1 step)
3. Move t1 to l1_1 (1 step)
4. Unload p2 (1 step)
5. Load p2 onto a1 (1 step)
6. Fly a1 to l2_1 (1 step)
7. Unload p2 (1 step)
8. Move t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (1 step)
9. Load p2 onto t2 (1 step)
10. Move t2 to l2_5 (1 step)
11. Unload p2 (satisfying constraint 1) (1 step)
12. Load p2 onto t2 (1 step)
13. Move t2 to l2_3 (1 step)
14. Unload p2 (satisfying constraint 2) (1 step)
15. Load p2 onto t2 (1 step)
16. Move t2 to l2_4 (1 step)
17. Unload p2 (satisfying constraint 3) (1 step)
18. Load p2 onto t2 (1 step)
19. Move t2 to l2_1 (1 step)
20. Unload p2 (1 step)
21. Load p2 onto a1 (1 step)
22. Fly a1 to l1_1 (1 step)
23. Unload p2 (1 step)
24. Load p2 onto t1 (1 step)
25. Move t1 to l1_3 (1 step)
26. Unload p2 (1 step)

This is a bit longer! It seems like the strategy of satisfying constraint 1 with p2 in a1 is more efficient.

Let's also check one more optimization. Instead of satisfying constraint 3 with p2 in l2_4, we could satisfy it with p2 in a2. Would that be more efficient? Let's see:

1. Move t1 from l1_5 to l1_3 (1 step)
2. Load p2 onto t1 (1 step)
3. Move t1 to l1_1 (1 step)
4. Unload p2 (1 step)
5. Load p2 onto a1 (satisfying constraint 1) (1 step)
6. Fly a1 to l2_1 (1 step)
7. Unload p2 (1 step)
8. Load p2 onto a2 (satisfying constraint 3) (1 step)
9. Unload p2 (1 step)
10. Move t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (1 step)
11. Load p2 onto t2 (1 step)
12. Move t2 to l2_3 (1 step)
13. Unload p2 (satisfying constraint 2) (1 step)
14. Load p2 onto t2 (1 step)
15. Move t2 to l2_1 (1 step)
16. Unload p2 (1 step)
17. Load p2 onto a1 (1 step)
18. Fly a1 to l1_1 (1 step)
19. Unload p2 (1 step)
20. Load p2 onto t1 (1 step)
21. Move t1 to l1_3 (1 step)
22. Unload p2 (1 step)

This is 22 steps, which is one step less than the best option. So, it seems like the path with satisfying constraint 1 with p2 in a1, constraint 2 with p2 in l2_3, and constraint 3 with p2 in a2 might be the most efficient. But let me check another option:

What if we try to streamline the steps 7-16 in the above plan?
7. Unload p2 (1 step)
8. Load p2 onto a2 (satisfying constraint 3) (1 step)
9. Unload p2 (1 step)
10. Move t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (1 step)
11. Load p2 onto t2 (1 step)
12. Move t2 to l2_3 (1 step)
13. Unload p2 (satisfying constraint 2) (1 step)
14. Load p2 onto t2 (1 step)
15. Move t2 to l2_1 (1 step)
16. Unload p2 (1 step)

Maybe we could optimize by not loading and unloading from a2:
7. Unload p2 (1 step)
8. Move t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (1 step)
9. Load p2 onto t2 (1 step)
10. Move t2 to l2_3 (1 step)
11. Unload p2 (satisfying constraint 2) (1 step)
12. Load p2 onto t2 (1 step)
13. Move t2 to l2_1 (1 step)
14. Unload p2 (1 step)
15. Load p2 onto a2 (satisfying constraint 3) (1 step)
16. Unload p2 (1 step)

But this doesn't save any steps overall.

Hmm, let's see what happens if we satisfy constraint 3 with p2 in l2_4, and, after satisfying constraint 2 with p2 in l2_3, move toward l2_4 (instead of going back to l2_1).

1. Move t1 from l1_5 to l1_3 (1 step)
2. Load p2 onto t1 (1 step)
3. Move t1 to l1_1 (1 step)
4. Unload p2 (1 step)
5. Load p2 onto a1 (satisfying constraint 1) (1 step)
6. Fly a1 to l2_1 (1 step)
7. Unload p2 (1 step)
8. Move t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (1 step)
9. Load p2 onto t2 (1 step)
10. Move t2 to l2_3 (1 step)
11. Unload p2 (satisfying constraint 2) (1 step)
12. Load p2 onto t2 (1 step)
13. Move t2 to l2_4 (1 step)
14. Unload p2 (satisfying constraint 3) (1 step)
15. Load p2 onto t2 (1 step)
16. Move t2 to l2_1 (1 step)
17. Unload p2 (1 step)
18. Load p2 onto a1 (1 step)
19. Fly a1 to l1_1 (1 step)
20. Unload p2 (1 step)
21. Load p2 onto t1 (1 step)
22. Move t1 to l1_3 (1 step)
23. Unload p2 (1 step)

That's 23 steps, which is one more than our best so far. So, the most efficient path seems to be the one with 22 steps, satisfying constraint 1 with p2 in a1, constraint 2 with p2 in l2_3, and constraint 3 with p2 in a2.

But wait, I just realized I might have been miscounting in my step-by-step breakdown. Let me write out the complete plan, with the action names as required, to ensure clarity:

1. "drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1"
2. "loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3"
3. "drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1"
4. "unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1"
5. "loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1" (satisfying constraint 1, option A)
6. "flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1"
7. "unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1"
8. "loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1" (satisfying constraint 3, option B)
9. "unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1"
10. "drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2"
11. "loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1"
12. "drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2"
13. "unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3" (satisfying constraint 2, option B)
14. "loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3"
15. "drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2"
16. "unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1"
17. "loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1"
18. "flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1"
19. "unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1"
20. "loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1"
21. "drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1"
22. "unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3"

Indeed, this is 22 steps, and it seems to be the optimal plan for this problem.

Wait, but I think I'm forgetting an important initial condition. Let me re-check: both p1 and p2 are already in l1_3 initially. The goal is for both p1 and p2 to be in l1_3. So, p1 is already at its goal location, and we just need to move p2 around to satisfy the constraints and then return it to l1_3.

Let me make sure I have this right. (Checking the initial state and goal again...)

Yes, both p1 and p2 are in l1_3 initially, and the goal is for both to be in l1_3. So my plan should be correct.

So the final optimal plan is:

1. "drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1"
2. "loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3"
3. "drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1"
4. "unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1"
5. "loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1" (satisfying constraint 1, option A)
6. "flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1"
7. "unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1"
8. "loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1" (satisfying constraint 3, option B)
9. "unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1"
10. "drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2"
11. "loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1"
12. "drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2"
13. "unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3" (satisfying constraint 2, option B)
14. "loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3"
15. "drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2"
16. "unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1"
17. "loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1"
18. "flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1"
19. "unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1"
20. "loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1"
21. "drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1"
22. "unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3"

I think I've verified that this is the optimal plan.

Actually, let me think one more time if there are any other ways we might optimize this. Could we use the other truck, t1, at all to optimize our plan? It doesn't seem like it would help, as t1 is already being used in our plan to move p2. And since p1 is already in its goal location, there's no need to move it.

What about satisfying constraint 2 with "Package p1 is in t2"? That would involve moving p1 from l1_3 to t2, which is a bit of a detour. But let's sketch it out:

1. Move t1 from l1_5 to l1_3 (1 step)
2. Load p1 onto t1 (1 step)
3. Load p2 onto t1 (1 step)
4. Move t1 to l1_1 (1 step)
5. Unload p1 (1 step)
6. Unload p2 (1 step)
7. Load p1 onto a1 (1 step)
8. Load p2 onto a1 (satisfying constraint 1) (1 step)
9. Fly a1 to l2_1 (1 step)
10. Unload p1 (1 step)
11. Unload p2 (1 step)
12. Move t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (1 step)
13. Load p1 onto t2 (satisfying constraint 2) (1 step)
14. Load p2 onto a2 (satisfying constraint 3) (1 step)
15. Unload p1 from t2 (1 step)
16. Unload p2 from a2 (1 step)
17. Load p1 onto a1 (1 step)
18. Load p2 onto a1 (1 step)
19. Fly a1 to l1_1 (1 step)
20. Unload p1 (1 step)
21. Unload p2 (1 step)
22. Load p1 onto t1 (1 step)
23. Load p2 onto t1 (1 step)
24. Move t1 to l1_3 (1 step)
25. Unload p1 (1 step)
26. Unload p2 (1 step)

This is 26 steps, so it's not more efficient.

I think I've exhaustively checked our options, and the 22-step plan I provided is indeed optimal:

1. "drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1"
2. "loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3"
3. "drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1"
4. "unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1"
5. "loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1" (satisfying constraint 1, option A)
6. "flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1"
7. "unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1"
8. "loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1" (satisfying constraint 3, option B)
9. "unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1"
10. "drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2"
11. "loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1"
12. "drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2"
13. "unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3" (satisfying constraint 2, option B)
14. "loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3"
15. "drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2"
16. "unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1"
17. "loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1"
18. "flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1"
19. "unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1"
20. "loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1"
21. "drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1"
22. "unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3"
