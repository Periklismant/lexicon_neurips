Let me work through this step-by-step to find an optimal plan.

First, I'll analyze the problem:

Initial state:
- Package t1 is in location l1_4
- Package t2 is in location l2_5
- Package p1 is in location l2_2
- Package p2 is in location l1_4
- Package a1 is in location l1_1 (this seems to be a mistake, a1 is an airplane)
- Package a2 is in location l2_1 (this seems to be a mistake, a2 is an airplane)

I think there are typos in the initial state. Let me assume that:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_4
- Truck t2 is in location l2_5
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

Goals:
- Package p1 is in location l2_5
- Package p2 is in location l1_3

Constraints:
1. "Package p2 is in location l1_3" must be true at some point
2. If "Package p2 is in location l1_3" is true, there must be an earlier state where "Package p2 is in location l1_2" is true
3. "Package p1 is in location l2_2" must be true at some point
4. If "Package p1 is in location l2_2" is true at state s, then either "Package p2 is in location l1_2" or "Package p2 is in location l1_4" must be true at s or later
5. At some point, either "Package p1 is in t1" or "Package p1 is in location l1_1" must be true

Let's plan for each package:

For p1 (currently at l2_2):
- We need to move it to l2_5
- Based on constraint 5, p1 must be either in truck t1 or at location l1_1 at some point
- Given constraint 3, p1 must be at l2_2 at some point, but it's already there

For p2 (currently at l1_4):
- We need to move it to l1_3
- Based on constraint 2, p2 must be at l1_2 before it can be at l1_3

Let's think about the plan:

1. For p1:
   - p1 starts at l2_2
   - It needs to end at l2_5
   - At some point, it needs to be either in t1 or at l1_1
   - Since t1 is at l1_4 initially, we need to move p1 to a location where it can be loaded into t1, or transport it to l1_1

2. For p2:
   - p2 starts at l1_4
   - It needs to be moved to l1_2 first
   - Then it needs to be moved to l1_3
   - Truck t1 is at l1_4 where p2 is, so we can use it

Given constraint 4, we need to coordinate the timing such that when p1 is at l2_2, p2 is either at l1_2 or l1_4. Since p1 starts at l2_2 and p2 starts at l1_4, this constraint is immediately satisfied.

Let's develop a plan:

1. For p1:
   - Use truck t2 to transport p1 from l2_2 to l2_1 (airport)
   - Load p1 onto airplane a2
   - Fly a2 to l1_1 (satisfying constraint 5)
   - Unload p1 at l1_1
   - Load p1 onto airplane a1
   - Fly a1 to l2_1
   - Unload p1 at l2_1
   - Load p1 onto truck t2 (assuming we've moved t2 to l2_1)
   - Drive t2 to l2_5
   - Unload p1 at l2_5

2. For p2:
   - Load p2 onto truck t1 at l1_4
   - Drive t1 to l1_2 (satisfying the prerequisite for constraint 2)
   - Unload p2 at l1_2
   - Load p2 onto truck t1 again
   - Drive t1 to l1_3
   - Unload p2 at l1_3 (satisfying constraint 1 and the goal)

Wait, I made a mistake in trying to satisfy constraint 5. It says p1 must be in truck t1 or at location l1_1. So far, I've planned to have p1 at l1_1, but not in truck t1. Let me reconsider.

One issue is that t1 is in city c1, while p1 is in city c2. To get p1 into t1, we need to:
1. Transport p1 from city c2 to city c1 using an airplane
2. Have t1 pick up p1 in city c1

Let me revise the plan:

For p1:
- Use truck t2 to transport p1 from l2_2 to l2_1 (airport)
- Load p1 onto airplane a2
- Fly a2 to l1_1
- Unload p1 at l1_1 (satisfying constraint 5)
- Drive truck t1 from l1_4 to l1_1
- Load p1 onto truck t1 (also satisfying constraint 5)
- Drive t1 back to l1_4 (to pick up p2)
- Drive t1 to l1_2
- Unload p1 at l1_2 (we'll use it later)
- Load p2 onto truck t1 at l1_4
- Drive t1 to l1_2
- Unload p2 at l1_2 (satisfying the prerequisite for constraint 2)
- Load p1 onto truck t1 again
- Drive t1 to l1_1
- Unload p1 at l1_1
- Load p1 onto airplane a1
- Fly a1 to l2_1
- Unload p1 at l2_1
- Use truck t2 to pick up p1 and transport it to l2_5
- Load p2 onto truck t1 again
- Drive t1 to l1_3
- Unload p2 at l1_3

However, I'm noticing that this plan is quite complex and may not be optimal. The key issue is that we have constraints requiring packages to be in specific locations at specific times, which limits our flexibility.

Given constraint 4, p2 must be either at l1_2 or l1_4 when p1 is at l2_2. Since p1 starts at l2_2, this constraint is initially satisfied. Let me optimize further.

Actually, I'm thinking about the problem differently now. I think there might be a simpler approach:

1. p1 starts at l2_2, and p2 starts at l1_4, so constraint 4 is immediately satisfied
2. For p1, we need to:
   - Either get it to location l1_1 or into truck t1 (constraint 5)
   - End with it at location l2_5 (goal)
3. For p2, we need to:
   - Move it to l1_2 (to satisfy constraint 2)
   - Then move it to l1_3 (goal)

Let me plan a more efficient solution:

1. For p2:
   - Load p2 onto truck t1 at l1_4
   - Drive t1 to l1_2
   - Unload p2 at l1_2 (satisfying the prerequisite for constraint 2)
   - Load p2 onto truck t1 again
   - Drive t1 to l1_3
   - Unload p2 at l1_3 (satisfying constraint 1 and the goal)

2. For p1:
   - Drive truck t2 from l2_5 to l2_2
   - Load p1 onto truck t2
   - Drive t2 to l2_1 (airport)
   - Unload p1
   - Load p1 onto airplane a2
   - Fly a2 to l1_1
   - Unload p1 at l1_1 (satisfying constraint 5)
   - Load p1 onto airplane a1
   - Fly a1 to l2_1
   - Unload p1
   - Load p1 onto truck t2
   - Drive t2 to l2_5
   - Unload p1 (satisfying the goal)

OK, this plan looks more efficient. Remember, we're assuming a1 and a2 are airplanes, not packages as incorrectly stated in the problem.

Let's review this plan against the constraints once more:

1. "Package p2 is in location l1_3" must be true at some point - Satisfied, p2 ends up at l1_3
2. If "Package p2 is in location l1_3" is true, there must be an earlier state where "Package p2 is in location l1_2" is true - Satisfied, p2 is moved to l1_2 before being moved to l1_3
3. "Package p1 is in location l2_2" must be true at some point - Satisfied, p1 starts at l2_2
4. If "Package p1 is in location l2_2" is true at state s, then either "Package p2 is in location l1_2" or "Package p2 is in location l1_4" must be true at s or later - Satisfied, p1 starts at l2_2, and p2 is at l1_4 initially, then moves to l1_2
5. At some point, either "Package p1 is in t1" or "Package p1 is in location l1_1" must be true - Satisfied, p1 is moved to l1_1

Actually, I realize I've been mistaken in my reasoning about constraint 4. The constraint states that if p1 is at l2_2 at state s, then either p2 is at l1_2 or p2 is at l1_4 at state s or later. Since p1 starts at l2_2, and p2 starts at l1_4, this constraint is indeed immediately satisfied.

For constraint 5, we need p1, to be either in truck t1 or at location l1_1 at some point. In my plan, I've satisfied this by moving p1 to l1_1.

Given the problem statement and constraints, this plan looks valid and reasonably efficient.

Alright, here's my refined step-by-step plan:

For p2:
1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1
3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
4. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
5. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1
6. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

For p1:
7. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
8. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
9. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
10. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
11. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
12. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
13. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
14. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
15. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
16. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
17. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
18. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
19. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

Let me check if there are any redundant or unnecessary steps:

I've added an unnecessary unload-reload of p2 at l1_2 (steps 3-4). We can optimize:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1
3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (this satisfies constraint 2)
4. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
5. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1
6. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

Upon further analysis, I realized the unload-reload of p2 at l1_2 is actually necessary to satisfy constraint 2, which requires that p2 be at l1_2 before it's at l1_3.

Actually, now I realize that the reasoning that this is necessary is still dubious. I think the real question is whether the step "unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2" results in "Package p2 is in location l1_2" being true in the state of the world. Given that one of the effects of unloadtruck is that "p is situated in l," this seems to be true. So constraint 2 would indeed be satisfied by this step, since there is a state where "Package p2 is in location l1_2" is true before "Package p2 is in location l1_3" becomes true.

Continuing with the plan:

7. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
8. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
9. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
10. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
11. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
12. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
13. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (this satisfies constraint 5)
14. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
15. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
16. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
17. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
18. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
19. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

For clarity, let me list the constraints and how they're met:

1. "Package p2 is in location l1_3" must be true at some point - Satisfied by step 6
2. If "Package p2 is in location l1_3" is true, there must be an earlier state where "Package p2 is in location l1_2" is true - Satisfied by step 3
3. "Package p1 is in location l2_2" must be true at some point - Satisfied initially (p1 starts at l2_2)
4. If "Package p1 is in location l2_2" is true at state s, then either "Package p2 is in location l1_2" or "Package p2 is in location l1_4" must be true at s or later - Satisfied because p1 starts at l2_2, and p2 starts at l1_4
5. At some point, either "Package p1 is in t1" or "Package p1 is in location l1_1" must be true - Satisfied by step 13

Hmm, but I'm not fulfilling constraint 5 in the sense of having p1 in truck t1. I've only arranged for p1 to be at location l1_1. But that's OK, because the constraint says "At least one of the following conditions is true: 'Package p1 is in t1', 'Package p1 is in location l1_1'", and I'm satisfying the latter condition.

Also, I'm still a bit confused about the initial state. The problem says:
- Package t1 is in location l1_4
- Package t2 is in location l2_5
- Package p1 is in location l2_2
- Package p2 is in location l1_4
- Package a1 is in location l1_1
- Package a2 is in location l2_1

But t1, t2, a1, and a2 are not packages; they're trucks and airplanes. I've been assuming that these are typos, and that the correct initial state is:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_4
- Truck t2 is in location l2_5
- Package p1 is in location l2_2
- Package p2 is in location l1_4
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

That's what I've been working with. If this assumption is incorrect, then my plan would need to be completely rethought.

Now, just to double check that there is no way to further optimize: 

For p2, we need to move it from l1_4 to l1_2 to l1_3. We need to use a truck for this, and t1 is already at l1_4, so that's optimal.

For p1, we need to move it from l2_2 to l2_5, and at some point, it must be at l1_1. Given that p1 is in a different city from l1_1, we need to use an airplane. The most direct route is to use t2 to take p1 to the airport l2_1, fly to l1_1, then fly back to l2_1, and use t2 to take p1 to l2_5.

However, I think I've been overthinking constraint 5. The constraint says that at some point, either p1 is in t1 or p1 is at l1_1. Given that t1 is in city c1 and p1 is in city c2, it would be more efficient to fly p1 directly to l2_5 without going to l1_1, if possible. But the constraint requires us to either get p1 into t1 or get p1 to l1_1, and the more efficient option seems to be to get p1 to l1_1, which is what I've planned.

I believe this is the most efficient plan that satisfies all constraints. Again, assuming the corrected initial state:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1
3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
4. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
5. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1
6. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
7. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
8. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
9. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
10. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
11. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
12. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
13. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
14. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
15. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
16. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
17. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
18. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
19. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

Upon further reflection, there might be one more optimization. If the airplane a1 is already at l1_1, we don't need to use a2 to fly p1 from l2_1 to l1_1. We could simply use a1 for the entire journey. This would eliminate steps 11-13.

I'm also a bit confused about constraint 3, which says "Package p1 is in location l2_2" must be true at some point. Since p1 starts at l2_2, this constraint is trivially satisfied. However, I'm wondering if there's a deeper requirement that I'm missing.

Let me make one more revision to the plan:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1
3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
4. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
5. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1
6. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
7. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
8. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
9. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
10. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
11. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
12. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
13. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
14. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
15. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
16. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

Wait, there's a logic error here. a1 is at l1_1 initially, but p1 is at l2_2, so we can't directly load p1 onto a1 at l1_1 in step 11.

OK, let me carefully go through the plan once more with a focus on the correct locations and potential optimizations.

Initial state:
- Package p1 is in location l2_2
- Package p2 is in location l1_4
- Truck t1 is in location l1_4
- Truck t2 is in location l2_5
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

For p2, we need to move it from l1_4 to l1_2 to l1_3. The plan for p2 is:
1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1
3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
4. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
5. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1
6. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

For p1, we need to move it from l2_2 to l2_5, and at some point, it must be at l1_1 or in t1. Let's say we choose to have it at l1_1.

7. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
8. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
9. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
10. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
11. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
12. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
13. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

Now p1 is at l1_1, satisfying constraint 5. Next, we need to get it back to l2_5:

14. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
15. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
16. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
17. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
18. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
19. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

This plan satisfies all constraints and seems to be optimal. The total number of actions is 19.

Now, is it possible to further optimize? I don't think so. The main constraints driving the complexity are:
1. p2 must be at l1_2 before it's at l1_3
2. p1 must be at l1_1 or in t1 at some point

Given these constraints, the current plan seems optimal. If I'm missing any optimizations, I'd be interested in feedback.

Here's the final plan I'm going with.

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1
3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
4. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
5. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1
6. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
7. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
8. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
9. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
10. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
11. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
12. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
13. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
14. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
15. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
16. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
17. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
18. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
19. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

Actually, I know there's an error in the initial state, because it refers to "Package t1," "Package t2," "Package a1," and "Package a2." But both the available actions and the detailed description of the domain make it clear that t1 and t2 are trucks, and a1 and a2 are airplanes. So I'm confident that the correct initial state is:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_4
- Truck t2 is in location l2_5
- Package p1 is in location l2_2
- Package p2 is in location l1_4
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

Also, "unloadairplane" appears to show up twice in the action list. The second one must be intended to be "unloadairplane p ap l", whereas the first one is intended to be "loadairplane p ap l". Otherwise, "loadairplane" would appear as an available action, then show up in the detailed action description; however, there's a second appearance as "loadairplane" in the action list. So I'll assume the first "loadairplane" is correct and the second one should be "unloadairplane".

I've been using the correct actions in my plan:
- loadtruck p t l
- loadairplane p ap l
- unloadtruck p t l
- unloadairplane p ap l
- drivetruck t l_from l_to c
- flyairplane ap l_from l_to

So my plan should be correct.

Actually, I'm still having doubts. Let me re-read the problem statement carefully...

"The available actions are the following:
	"loadtruck p t l": Load package p in truck t. Both p and t are in location l.
	"loadairplane p ap l": Load package p in airplane ap. Both p and ap are in location l.
	"unloadtruck p t l": Unload package p from truck t in location l.
	"loadairplane p ap l": Unload package p from airplane ap in location l."

I think there's a typo here. The second mention of "loadairplane" should be "unloadairplane". The subsequent detailed descriptions make this clear:

"The actions of this domain have the following preconditions:
	"loadtruck": You may only load package p in a truck t if p and t are in the same location l.
	"loadairplane": You may only load package p in a airplane ap if ap and t are in the same location l.
	"unloadtruck": You may only unload package p from a truck t in a location l if (i) t is situated in l, and (ii) p is in t.
	"unloadairplane": You may only unload package p from a airplane ap in a location l if (i) ap is situated in l, and (ii) p is in ap.
	"drivetruck": You may only move a truck t from location l_from to location l_to in a city c if (i) t is situated in l_from, and (ii) l_from and l_to are locations of c.
	"flyairplane": You may only fly an airplane ap from location l_from to location l_to if ap is situated in l_from."

So the available actions should be:
- loadtruck p t l
- loadairplane p ap l
- unloadtruck p t l
- unloadairplane p ap l
- drivetruck t l_from l_to c
- flyairplane ap l_from l_to

I've been using the correct actions in my plan.

As for the initial state, I still believe there's an error in the provided description. It says:

"The original state of the world is the following:
	"Location l1_1 is in city c1"
	"Location l1_2 is in city c1"
	"Location l1_3 is in city c1"
	"Location l1_4 is in city c1"
	"Location l1_5 is in city c1"
	"Location l2_1 is in city c2"
	"Location l2_2 is in city c2"
	"Location l2_3 is in city c2"
	"Location l2_4 is in city c2"
	"Location l2_5 is in city c2"
	"Package t1 is in location l1_4"
	"Package t2 is in location l2_5"
	"Package p1 is in location l2_2"
	"Package p2 is in location l1_4"
	"Package a1 is in location l1_1"
	"Package a2 is in location l2_1""

I'm confident that these are typos, and the last four lines should be:
- "Truck t1 is in location l1_4"
- "Truck t2 is in location l2_5"
- "Airplane a1 is in location l1_1"
- "Airplane a2 is in location l2_1"

Because otherwise, the provided actions wouldn't make sense, since they refer to trucks t1, t2 and airplanes a1, a2, which wouldn't exist in the world.

Based on this understanding, I believe my plan is correct and optimal.

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1
3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
4. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
5. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1
6. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
7. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
8. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
9. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
10. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
11. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
12. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
13. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
14. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
15. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
16. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
17. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
18. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
19. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

Double-checking once more: This plan satisfies all constraints and goals:
- Package p1 ends up at location l2_5
- Package p2 ends up at location l1_3
- Package p2 is at location l1_2 before it's at location l1_3
- Package p1 is at location l2_2 (it starts there)
- Package p1 is at location l1_1 at some point

Hmm I'm still confused about constraint 5. Let me check the constraint statement one more time.

"The following expression must hold in at least one state: 
	'At least one of the following conditions is true: "Package p1 is in t1", "Package p1 is in location l1_1"'"

OK, so the constraint is satisfied if *either* "Package p1 is in t1" *or* "Package p1 is in location l1_1" is true at some point. My plan satisfies this by having p1 at location l1_1 at step 13.

In conclusion, my plan is:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1
3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
4. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
5. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1
6. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
7. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
8. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
9. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
10. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
11. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
12. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
13. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
14. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
15. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
16. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
17. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
18. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
19. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
