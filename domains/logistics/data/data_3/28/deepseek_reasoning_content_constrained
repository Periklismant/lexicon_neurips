Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. So, the goal is to get package p1 to l2_5 and p2 to l1_3. Let me start by understanding the initial state and the constraints.

First, the initial state:

- Locations:
  - c1 has l1_1 (airport), l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5.
  - c2 has l2_1 (airport), l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5.
  
- Packages:
  - p1 is in l2_2 (city c2).
  - p2 is in l1_4 (city c1).
  
- Trucks:
  - t1 is in l1_4 (c1).
  - t2 is in l2_5 (c2).
  
- Airplanes:
  - a1 is in l1_1 (c1's airport).
  - a2 is in l2_1 (c2's airport).

The goal is p1 in l2_5 and p2 in l1_3.

Constraints:

1. p2 must be in l1_3 at some state.
2. Before p2 is in l1_3, it must have been in l1_2.
3. p1 must be in l2_2 at some state.
4. Whenever p1 is in l2_2 (state s), then in s or after, p2 must be in l1_2 or l1_4.
5. At some state, p1 is in t1 or l1_1.

Let me break this down.

Starting with p1: it's initially in l2_2 (city c2). The goal is l2_5. So how to move it? Since l2_2 and l2_5 are both in c2, maybe use truck t2, which is in l2_5. Wait, t2 is in l2_5. So to move p1 from l2_2 to l2_5, we need a truck. But t2 is already in l2_5. So maybe drive t2 to l2_2 first? Wait, but trucks can move within their city. So t2 is in c2's locations. So possible steps:

1. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2. But wait, can a truck drive between any locations in the same city? The drivetruck action requires that l_from and l_to are in the same city. So yes. So drive t2 to l2_2, load p1 into t2, then drive back to l2_5, unload.

But let's check the constraints. Constraint 3 says p1 must be in l2_2 at some state. But p1 is already in l2_2 initially. So that's satisfied. But wait, the initial state has p1 in l2_2. So constraint 3 is already met. However, constraint 4 says that whenever p1 is in l2_2 in some state s, then in s or after, p2 must be in l1_2 or l1_4. Since the initial state is p1 in l2_2, then we need to ensure that either in the initial state (s) or after, p2 is in l1_2 or l1_4. But p2 starts in l1_4. So that's already satisfied. Because in the initial state, p2 is in l1_4, which meets the condition. So that's okay. So moving p1 from l2_2 to l2_5 can be done by loading it into a truck in l2_2, but which truck? t2 is in l2_5. So maybe drive t2 to l2_2, load p1, drive back to l2_5, unload. That would work.

But let's check constraint 5: at some state, p1 is in t1 or l1_1. t1 is in c1's l1_4. So how can p1 get into t1 or l1_1? Since p1 starts in c2, to get it into c1, we'd need an airplane. But maybe the plan is to use airplane a2 in c2's airport l2_1. Wait, but p1 is in l2_2. So first, move p1 to l2_1 (airport) via truck, then load into airplane a2, fly to c1's airport l1_1, unload, then put into t1. But that's complicating things. But the goal is to have p1 in l2_5, which is in c2. So maybe that's not needed. Wait, no. The goal is for p1 to be in l2_5, which is in c2. So why would we need to move p1 to c1? Unless constraint 5 requires it. Let me check.

Constraint 5 says that in some state, p1 is in t1 (which is in c1) or l1_1 (c1's airport). But p1 is initially in c2. So unless we move p1 to c1, this constraint can't be satisfied. Wait, but how? Because the goal is to have p1 in l2_5, which is in c2. So maybe the plan involves moving p1 to c1 temporarily and then back? That seems inefficient, but maybe necessary to satisfy the constraint.

Wait, but maybe there's a mistake here. Let me re-examine constraint 5. It says that the expression "p1 is in t1 or l1_1" must hold in at least one state. Since p1 starts in l2_2, which is in c2, to get it into t1 (which is in c1's l1_4) or l1_1 (c1's airport), we need to transport it to c1. But the goal is to have p1 in l2_5 (c2). So we need to move p1 to c1 and then back to c2. But that adds steps. However, the constraints must be satisfied. So how to handle that?

Alternatively, maybe we can use airplane a2 (in l2_1) to carry p1. Let's see: if we load p1 into a2 in l2_1, but to do that, p1 has to be in l2_1. So first, move p1 from l2_2 to l2_1. Since l2_2 and l2_1 are in c2, but can a truck drive from l2_2 to l2_1? Wait, the cities are c1 and c2. Each city has its own locations. So l2_1 is an airport in c2. So truck t2 is in l2_5. So drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2 (load p1), then drive to l2_1? But can trucks move between l2_2 and l2_1? Are those locations in the same city? Yes, because l2_1 is in c2. So t2 can drive from l2_5 to l2_2, load p1, then drive to l2_1. Then unload p1 into a2 (airplane). Then fly a2 to l1_1 (c1's airport). Then unload p1 into t1 (but t1 is in l1_4). Wait, but then how to get t1 to l1_1? Because t1 is a truck in c1. So drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1, load p1 into t1, then drive back? But this seems like a lot of steps. But then, after that, to get p1 back to c2, we need to fly it again. But the goal is in c2's l2_5. So this seems very roundabout. But perhaps necessary to satisfy constraint 5.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to satisfy constraint 5 without moving p1 to c1. Wait, constraint 5 is that p1 is in t1 (truck in c1) or l1_1 (c1's airport). So unless we move p1 to c1, this can't be satisfied. Therefore, the plan must include moving p1 to c1, even though the goal is in c2. That complicates things. But the constraints must be met.

So let's outline the steps for p1:

1. Move p1 from l2_2 to l2_1 (using truck t2). So drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2, load p1, then drive to l2_1. Then load p1 into a2. Fly a2 to l1_1. Unload p1 into l1_1. Now, p1 is in l1_1, which satisfies constraint 5. Then, we need to get it back to c2. So load p1 into a1 (which is in l1_1), fly a1 to l2_1. Then unload p1 into l2_1, load into t2 again, drive to l2_5, unload. That's a lot of steps, but maybe necessary.

But wait, the problem requires an optimal plan, which is the shortest possible. So maybe there's a smarter way.

Wait, perhaps the constraint 5 can be satisfied by having p1 in t1. So if we can get p1 into t1 (which is in c1), that would work. How? To do that, we need to transport p1 to c1. Let's see:

- Use a2 (in l2_1) to fly p1 to l1_1. So first, get p1 to l2_1. Use t2 to drive from l2_5 to l2_2, load p1, drive to l2_1. Then load p1 into a2, fly to l1_1. Now, unload p1 into l1_1. Then, use truck t1 (which is in l1_4) to drive to l1_1, load p1 into t1. Now, p1 is in t1, which satisfies constraint 5. Then, drive t1 back to l1_4, unload p1. Then, load p1 into a1 (in l1_1?), fly to l2_1, unload, load into t2 again, drive to l2_5. But this seems very long. But maybe it's necessary.

But the goal is to have p1 in l2_5. So after all that, you need to get it back. This seems inefficient, but constraints might require it.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to satisfy constraint 5 without moving p1 all the way. Let me check the constraints again.

Constraint 5 says that in at least one state, p1 is in t1 or l1_1. So perhaps during the plan, even if the final goal is in c2, p1 must be in c1's truck or airport at some point.

So even if we have to take a detour, it's necessary.

Now, considering p2's movement. The goal is to get p2 from l1_4 to l1_3. The constraints for p2 are:

- Must be in l1_3 at some state.

- Before that, must have been in l1_2.

Also, during the plan, when p1 is in l2_2 (which it is initially), then after that state, p2 must be in l1_2 or l1_4. Since p1 starts in l2_2, that state is the initial state. So in the initial state, p2 is in l1_4. So that condition is already satisfied. So as long as p2 is moved to l1_3 after that, but first passing through l1_2.

So for p2:

Current location: l1_4 (c1). Need to get to l1_3.

Truck t1 is in l1_4. So load p2 into t1, drive to l1_2, unload. Then, drive t1 to l1_3, unload again? Wait, no. Because trucks can carry packages. So steps:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (since both are there).

2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1.

3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2. Now p2 is in l1_2. Then, drive to l1_3, unload.

Wait, but to drive from l1_2 to l1_3, need to have t1 there. So after unloading in l1_2, t1 is in l1_2. Then drive to l1_3 (same city), unload p2 there. But how? Because after unloading in l1_2, p2 is in l1_2, and t1 is empty. Wait, but we need to get p2 to l1_3. So maybe:

After step 3 (unload in l1_2), p2 is in l1_2. Then, load it again into t1 (but t1 is in l1_2), drive to l1_3, unload. That would work. But that's two more steps. So the steps for p2 would be:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1

3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (now p2 is in l1_2, satisfying the constraint that before l1_3, it was in l1_2)

4. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

5. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1

6. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (goal achieved)

But that's four actions for p2. Is there a shorter way?

Alternatively, after moving t1 to l1_2 and unloading, then drive t1 to l1_3, but p2 is already in l1_2. So no, you need to load it again. So that's necessary.

Now, combining both p1 and p2's movements, and the constraints.

But p1's movement has to involve moving to c1 to satisfy constraint 5, which complicates things.

Wait, maybe there's a way to satisfy constraint 5 without moving p1 to c1. Let me check the initial state again.

Wait, the initial state says:

"Package t1 is in location l1_4"

Wait, wait, the initial state's objects include "truck t1" and "truck t2". The packages are p1 and p2. The original state says:

"Package t1 is in location l1_4"

Wait, that must be a typo. Because t1 is a truck, not a package. Looking back at the problem statement:

The original state of the world is the following:

	"Location l1_1 is in city c1"

	... 

	"Package t1 is in location l1_4"

Wait, that's incorrect. Because t1 is a truck. So this must be a mistake in the problem statement. But assuming that's a typo, perhaps it's supposed to be "Truck t1 is in location l1_4". Similarly for "Package t2 is in location l2_5" should be "Truck t2 is in location l2_5".

Similarly, "Package a1 is in location l1_1" should be "Airplane a1 is in location l1_1".

Otherwise, the problem doesn't make sense. Because airplanes and trucks can't be packages. So assuming that's a typo, the initial state should be:

- Trucks:
  - t1 is in l1_4 (c1)
  - t2 is in l2_5 (c2)
  
- Airplanes:
  - a1 is in l1_1 (c1's airport)
  - a2 is in l2_1 (c2's airport)
  
- Packages:
  - p1 is in l2_2 (c2)
  - p2 is in l1_4 (c1)

That makes more sense. So with that correction, let's proceed.

So, p1 is in l2_2 (c2), needs to go to l2_5 (c2). Truck t2 is in l2_5. So steps for p1:

1. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2 (c2). Then load p1 into t2. Then drive back to l2_5 and unload. That would take 3 actions: drive, load, drive, unload. Wait:

- drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2

- loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

- drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2

- unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

But that's four actions. But maybe there's a shorter way. Alternatively, if the truck is already at l2_5, but p1 is in l2_2. So the truck needs to go to l2_2 to pick up p1. So the steps are necessary.

But according to constraint 5, p1 must be in t1 (c1's truck) or l1_1 (c1's airport) at some point. So how to handle that? Because the current plan for p1 doesn't involve moving to c1. So this would violate constraint 5.

Therefore, the plan must include moving p1 to c1. So integrating that into the plan.

So, first, move p1 from l2_2 to c1's l1_1 via airplane, then back to c2.

Steps:

For p1:

1. Move p1 from l2_2 to l2_1 (c2's airport) using truck t2.

   a. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2

   b. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

   c. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2

   d. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

2. Load p1 into airplane a2 (at l2_1).

   e. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

3. Fly a2 to l1_1 (c1's airport).

   f. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

4. Unload p1 from a2 into l1_1.

   g. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

Now, p1 is in l1_1, satisfying constraint 5 (since l1_1 is one of the required locations). Then, to get p1 back to c2's l2_5:

5. Load p1 into a1 (which is in l1_1).

   h. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

6. Fly a1 to l2_1.

   i. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

7. Unload p1 into l2_1.

   j. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

8. Load p1 into truck t2 (drive t2 to l2_1 if necessary? Wait, after step d, t2 was in l2_1. Then after step d, t2 is in l2_1. Then steps e and f involve the airplane. So after step j, p1 is in l2_1. Then we need to load it into t2. But truck t2 is in l2_1? Let's track the truck movements.

Wait, in step a, t2 is driven from l2_5 to l2_2 (c2). Then step c drives t2 from l2_2 to l2_1. So after step d, t2 is in l2_1.

So after step j, p1 is in l2_1. We need to load it into t2 (which is in l2_1):

k. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

Then drive t2 to l2_5 and unload:

l. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2

m. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

This completes p1's movement.

But this is a lot of steps. Now, for p2's movement.

p2 is in l1_4 (c1). Need to get to l1_3. Using truck t1 (in l1_4):

Steps:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1

3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (now p2 is in l1_2, meeting the precondition for the constraint)

4. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

5. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1

6. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

Now, combining both sequences.

But also, the constraints:

- The plan must have p1 in l2_2 at some state. But p1 starts in l2_2, so that's covered.

- When p1 is in l2_2 (initial state), then p2 must be in l1_2 or l1_4 at s or after. Since in the initial state, p2 is in l1_4, that's satisfied.

- The plan must have p2 in l1_3, which is achieved in step 6.

- Before p2 is in l1_3, it must be in l1_2 (step 3).

- The plan must have p1 in t1 or l1_1. This is achieved in step g, where p1 is in l1_1.

Now, checking the order of actions. Because some actions can be done in parallel if they don't interfere.

But since the problem requires a linear plan, we need to sequence them.

But perhaps some steps can be interleaved. For example, moving p2 while p1 is being transported.

So the total steps would be:

For p1:

a. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2

b. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

c. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2

d. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

e. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

f. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

g. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (satisfies constraint 5)

h. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

i. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

j. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

k. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

l. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2

m. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

For p2:

n. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

o. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1

p. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

q. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

r. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1

s. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

Now, the total steps are 13 for p1 and 6 for p2, but some can be interleaved.

But the order matters. For example, moving p1 to l1_1 (steps a-g) can be done before or after moving p2. But we need to check for any interdependencies.

However, the constraints require that when p1 is in l2_2 (which is the initial state), then p2 must be in l1_2 or l1_4 at that state or after. Since in the initial state, p2 is in l1_4, which satisfies the condition. Then, when we move p2 to l1_2, that's okay as long as it's after the initial state. But since the initial state is s0, any subsequent state is after.

Now, let's interleave the steps to find the optimal order.

But considering that the airplanes and trucks are in different cities, the actions for p1 and p2 can be done in parallel where possible.

For example:

After step a (drive t2 to l2_2), we can start moving p2.

But let's think step by step.

Wait, in step a, we drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2. Then step b loads p1 into t2. Then step c drives to l2_1. Steps a, b, c are all for p1.

Meanwhile, for p2:

n. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (t1 is already there)

o. drive t1 to l1_2

p. unload p2 in l1_2

q. load p2 again

r. drive to l1_3

s. unload.

These can be done in parallel with p1's steps as long as there's no dependency.

But since the problem requires a linear plan, the optimal plan would interleave actions if it shortens the total steps.

But perhaps some actions can be done in parallel, but since the plan is a sequence, we need to find the minimal number of actions.

Wait, but the minimal plan might require some ordering. For example, p2's movement doesn't depend on p1's movement, except for the constraints.

But the key is to find the shortest possible sequence that achieves the goals and satisfies all constraints.

Let me try to outline a possible optimal plan:

1. For p2: load into t1, drive to l1_2, unload. Then load again, drive to l1_3, unload.

But how many steps? 5 steps: load, drive, unload, drive, unload? Wait, no. To get from l1_4 to l1_2:

loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1

unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

Then, to move to l1_3:

drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1

But since the package is already unloaded, need to load again:

loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1

unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

That's 6 actions for p2.

For p1, to satisfy constraint 5, we need to move it to l1_1 or into t1.

But moving to l1_1 requires flying. So steps:

For p1:

load into t2, drive to l2_1, load into a2, fly to l1_1, unload (now in l1_1, satisfying constraint 5). Then fly back, load into t2, drive to l2_5.

But that's 8 actions.

But combining both sequences, maybe some steps can be shared.

But the total steps would be 6 (p2) + 8 (p1) = 14, but perhaps some steps can be interleaved.

But maybe there's a way to optimize.

Wait, maybe p1 can be loaded into a2 and flown to l1_1 without needing to drive t2 back. Let's see.

Original p1 steps:

1. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2: drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2

2. Load p1: loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

3. Drive t2 to l2_1: drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2

4. Unload p1 into l2_1: unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

5. Load into a2: loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

6. Fly to l1_1: flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

7. Unload: unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (now constraint 5 satisfied)

8. Load into a1: loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

9. Fly to l2_1: flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

10. Unload: unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

11. Load into t2 (which is at l2_1 from step 3): loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

12. Drive to l2_5: drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2

13. Unload: unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

That's 13 steps for p1.

But maybe steps 8-13 can be optimized. For example, after step 7 (p1 in l1_1), instead of loading into a1, perhaps use another method. But I don't see a shorter way. To get p1 back to c2, you need to fly it back.

Alternatively, after step 7, use truck t1 to carry p1. But truck t1 is in c1. If t1 is in l1_2 after moving p2, perhaps drive t1 to l1_1, load p1, drive to l1_4 (but that's within c1), then fly? No, that doesn't help. So the only way is to use airplanes.

Thus, the steps for p1 are necessary.

Now, combining both p1 and p2's steps:

The plan would have to interleave these actions.

But the key is to find the minimal total steps.

Let's try to find the optimal plan.

Possible order:

1. Start with moving p2 first.

Action 1: loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

Action 2: drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1

Action 3: unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (now p2 is in l1_2)

At this point, the constraint that when p1 is in l2_2 (initially true), then p2 must be in l1_2 or l1_4. Since p2 is now in l1_2, which satisfies that for the initial state.

Now, proceed with p1's steps.

Action 4: drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2

Action 5: loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

Action 6: drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2

Action 7: unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

Action 8: loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

Action 9: flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

Action 10: unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (constraint 5 met)

Now, move p2 to l1_3.

Action 11: loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

Action 12: drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1

Action 13: unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (p2's goal achieved)

Now, move p1 back to c2.

Action 14: loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

Action 15: flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

Action 16: unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

Action 17: loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

Action 18: drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2

Action 19: unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (p1's goal achieved)

That's 19 actions. But perhaps this can be optimized.

Wait, after action 10, p1 is in l1_1. Can we fly a1 to l2_1 immediately?

Yes:

Action 14: flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (but a1 starts in l1_1, which is correct. Wait, but a1 is already in l1_1. To fly it to l2_1, we need to load p1 into a1.

Wait, after action 10, p1 is in l1_1. To fly it back, we need to load it into a1 (which is at l1_1).

So:

Action 14: loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

Action 15: flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

Action 16: unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

Then, truck t2 is in l2_1 (from action 6, which was drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2).

So:

Action 17: loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

Action 18: drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2

Action 19: unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

Yes.

But perhaps there's a way to interleave actions to reduce the total steps.

For example, while p1 is being flown to l1_1, maybe p2 can be moved to l1_3.

But in the current order, after p2 is unloaded in l1_2 (action 3), it's loaded again in action 11.

Alternatively, perhaps after action 3 (p2 in l1_2), during the time p1 is being moved to l1_1, we can process p2's next steps.

But this doesn't necessarily reduce the steps, just the order.

Another possible optimization: when p1 is being flown back to l2_1, maybe p2's steps can be done in parallel. But since it's a linear plan, we have to sequence them.

Is there a shorter way? Let's think.

Alternative plan:

For p1:

- Use airplane a2 to move p1 to l1_1, but then use airplane a1 to return. But perhaps we can reuse a2 to fly back.

Wait, airplane a2 is in l2_1 initially. After flying to l1_1, it's there. So to fly back, we need to have a reason.

Wait, after action 9: fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1. Now a2 is in l1_1. To fly it back, we need to load p1 into a2 again.

So:

Action 10: unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

Action 11: loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

Action 12: flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1

Action 13: unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

Then load into t2 and drive to l2_5.

This would save steps compared to using a1. Because using a2 instead of a1 would avoid needing to load into a1.

Because a1 is in l1_1 initially. Wait, no. Original state says "airplane a1 is in l1_1". So a1 is already in l1_1. So after action 9, a2 is in l1_1. a1 is also in l1_1.

So after unloading p1 into l1_1, we can load p1 into a1 (which is already there) or a2 (now in l1_1).

If we use a1:

Action 11: loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

Action 12: flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

Action 13: unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

Then steps.

Alternatively, using a2:

Action 11: loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

Action 12: flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1

Action 13: unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

Either way, same number of steps.

But using a2 might be better since a2 is already used, but it doesn't affect the count.

So, using a1 or a2 doesn't change the number of steps.

Another optimization: when returning p1 to c2, after unloading into l2_1, truck t2 is already there (from step 6). So no need to drive it again. So steps:

After unloading p1 into l2_1 (action 13):

Action 14: loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

Action 15: drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2

Action 16: unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

That's three steps.

So total steps for p1: 16 actions? Let's recount:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2

2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2

4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

5. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

6. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

7. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

8. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

9. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

10. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

11. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

12. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2

13. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

That's 13 steps for p1.

For p2:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1

3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

4. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

5. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1

6. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

Total 6 steps.

Total steps when interleaved: 13 + 6 = 19.

But perhaps some steps can be done in parallel. For example, after moving p2 to l1_2 (step 3), we can start moving p1 while moving p2 to l1_3.

But since the plan must be a sequence, interleaving might not reduce the total steps.

Wait, but maybe the steps for p2 can be done while p1 is being transported via airplane.

For example:

After action 7 (unload p1 into l1_1), we can process p2's steps 4-6 while p1 is being flown back.

Let's try:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1

3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

4. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (wait, t2 is in l2_5 initially. No, step 1 for p1 is drivetruck t2 to l2_2.

Wait, the interleaving would be:

Action 1: drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2 (p1's step)

Action 2: loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (p2's step)

Action 3: loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (p1's step)

Action 4: drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 (p1's step)

Action 5: drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1 (p2's step)

Action 6: unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (p1's step)

Action 7: unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (p2's step)

Action 8: loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (p1's step)

Action 9: flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (p1's step)

Action 10: loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (p2's step)

Action 11: drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1 (p2's step)

Action 12: unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (p1's step)

Action 13: unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (p2's step)

Action 14: loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (p1's step)

Action 15: flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (p1's step)

Action 16: unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 (p1's step)

Action 17: loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (p1's step)

Action 18: drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2 (p1's step)

Action 19: unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (p1's step)

This interleaving still results in 19 actions. There's no reduction in steps.

Is there a way to reduce the number of steps? Let's think.

Alternative approach for p1: instead of flying to l1_1, can we load p1 into t1 (in c1) to satisfy constraint 5?

How? To do that, p1 needs to be in c1. So:

1. Move p1 to c2's airport l2_1 using truck t2.

2. Load into airplane a2, fly to c1's airport l1_1.

3. Unload into l1_1.

4. Load into truck t1 (drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1).

5. Load p1 into t1.

6. Drive t1 back to l1_4.

7. Unload p1 into l1_4.

8. Load into airplane a1 (if available), fly back to c2.

But this seems longer. Let's count the steps:

For p1:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2

2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2

4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

5. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

6. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

7. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

8. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1

9. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

10. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

11. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

12. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_4 (but a1 is in l1_1. So need to move a1 to l1_4? No, airplanes can only move between airports. So l1_4 is not an airport. So this won't work.

So this approach isn't feasible. Hence, the initial plan to fly p1 to l1_1 and back via airplanes is necessary.

Thus, the minimal plan length is 19 actions. But this seems quite long. Is there a way to shorten it?

Wait, perhaps the constraint 5 can be satisfied earlier, allowing some steps to be skipped.

Constraint 5 requires that p1 is in t1 or l1_1 at least once. If we can get p1 into l1_1 early and then proceed, but that would still require the same steps.

Another idea: after moving p1 to l1_1 (step 7), instead of flying it back, maybe there's a way to use another airplane or truck. But since the goal is in c2, we must return.

Alternatively, can we use the same airplane a2 to fly back? After step 7, a2 is in l1_1. Load p1 into a2 and fly back to l2_1.

So:

7. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

8. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

9. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1

10. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

This would save steps compared to using a1. Because a1 is already in l1_1, but using a2 would avoid needing to load into a different airplane.

Yes, this way, we can save two steps (using a2 instead of a1). Let's adjust the plan:

For p1:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2

2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2

4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

5. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

6. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

7. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (constraint 5 met)

8. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

9. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1

10. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

11. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

12. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2

13. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

That's 13 steps for p1.

For p2: 6 steps.

Total steps when interleaved: 13 +6 =19. But by reusing a2, maybe we can reduce it.

Wait, in this revised plan, p1's steps are 13. Previously, it was 13 when using a1. So no reduction in steps. But perhaps the order can be optimized.

Another observation: after step 7 (p1 in l1_1), we can immediately load it back into a2 and fly back, reducing the steps. Let's see:

After step 7:

8. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

9. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1

10. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

Then steps 11-13.

This is the same as before. So the total steps for p1 are still 13.

Thus, I think the minimal plan requires 19 actions. However, this seems too long for an optimal plan. I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps there's a different way to satisfy constraint 5. For example, if p1 is loaded into t1 (truck in c1), but how?

Since p1 starts in c2, we need to move it to c1. To load into t1, which is in c1's l1_4, we need to:

1. Fly p1 to l1_1 (as before).

2. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1.

3. Load p1 into t1.

4. Drive t1 back to l1_4.

5. Unload p1 into l1_4.

6. Then fly p1 back to c2.

This would take:

For steps 1-5:

a. Fly p1 to l1_1 (5 steps as before)

b. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 (1 action)

c. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (1 action)

d. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1 (1 action)

e. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4 (1 action)

Then fly back:

f. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_4 (wait, but a1 is in l1_1. Can't load here. So need to drive to l1_1.

So steps f. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 (again)

g. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

h. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

i. fly to l2_1

j. unload, etc.

This adds many more steps. So not better.

Therefore, the initial approach of flying p1 to l1_1 and back seems necessary.

Now, considering all this, perhaps the optimal plan is 19 steps. But I'm supposed to provide an optimal plan with minimal steps. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Wait, maybe the constraint 5 can be satisfied by having p1 in l1_1 during its transit. For example, when p1 is unloaded at l1_1 (step 7), that satisfies the constraint, and then we proceed to fly it back. So the steps for p1 are necessary.

Alternatively, perhaps the plan can be optimized by combining p2's movement with p1's.

But no, since they are in different cities.

Another idea: can we move p2 first, then p1, thus avoiding some constraints?

But the constraint about p1 being in l2_2 is already satisfied in the initial state, and as long as p2 is in l1_2 or l1_4 at that state or after, which it is (initially l1_4, then l1_2).

But regardless, the steps for p2 are necessary.

Another observation: when p1 is in l2_1 (after step 4), maybe there's a way to load it into a2 and fly to l2_5's airport (but l2_5 isn't an airport). Airports are l1_1 and l2_1 only. So no, to get to l2_5, you need a truck.

Thus, the steps for p1 are unavoidable.

Given all this, the optimal plan would indeed require 19 steps. However, this seems very long, so perhaps I'm missing a more efficient approach.

Wait, let's re-examine the constraints. The fifth constraint says that in at least one state, p1 is in t1 or l1_1. So if p1 is in l1_1 even briefly, that's sufficient. So maybe we can fly p1 to l1_1, then immediately fly it back, without needing to do anything else. But then, how to satisfy the goal of p1 being in l2_5.

Wait, the goal requires p1 to be in l2_5. So the steps to move p1 to l1_1 and back are necessary to satisfy constraint 5, but then p1 needs to be transported to l2_5 via truck.

But perhaps there's a way to combine the steps.

Alternative approach:

1. Move p1 to l2_1 using truck t2.

2. Fly p1 to l1_1, unload (satisfies constraint 5).

3. Fly p1 back to l2_1.

4. Use truck t2 to drive to l2_5.

This requires:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2

2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2

4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

5. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

6. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

7. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (constraint 5 met)

8. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

9. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1

10. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

11. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

12. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2

13. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

This is 13 steps for p1.

For p2:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1

3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

4. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

5. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1

6. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

Total steps: 13 +6 =19.

But perhaps some steps can be merged.

Wait, after step 7 (unload p1 in l1_1), can we fly back immediately?

Yes. So steps 8-10 are fly back.

But this plan still requires 13 steps for p1 and 6 for p2.

Another idea: maybe during the time p1 is being flown to l1_1 and back, p2 is being moved. So interleaving these steps might not save steps but allows for the same total.

For example:

1. Start moving p2 first:

Action 1: loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

Action 2: drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1

Action 3: unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

Now, p2 is in l1_2. Now, proceed with p1:

Action 4: drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2

Action 5: loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

Action 6: drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2

Action 7: unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

Action 8: loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

Action 9: flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

Action 10: unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (constraint 5 met)

Action 11: loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

Action 12: flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1

Action 13: unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

Action 14: loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

Action 15: drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2

Action 16: unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

Then, finish p2's movement:

Action 17: loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

Action 18: drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1

Action 19: unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

But this still totals 19 actions.

So regardless of the order, it's 19 steps. But perhaps there's a smarter way to interleave the actions.

Wait, maybe after action 3 (p2 in l1_2), we can perform actions for p2 while p1 is being flown.

For example:

After action 3:

Action 4: loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

Action 5: drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1

Action 6: unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

Then proceed with p1's steps. But this would mean p2's steps are done in 6 actions, and p1's steps in 13, total 19.

But perhaps p1's steps can be done after p2's steps, but that doesn't change the count.

Alternatively, after moving p2 to l1_3 (step 6), proceed with p1's steps. But the total steps remain the same.

Given this, I think the minimal plan requires 19 steps. However, this seems quite long, and I might have missed a more optimal path.

Wait, perhaps there's a way to satisfy constraint 5 without moving p1 to c1. Let me re-examine constraint 5.

The fifth constraint states: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "At least one of the following conditions is true: "Package p1 is in t1", "Package p1 is in location l1_1""

So p1 must be in t1 (truck in c1) or l1_1 (c1's airport) at some point.

But p1 starts in c2. To get into t1 or l1_1, p1 must be moved to c1. There's no other way.

Thus, the steps to move p1 to l1_1 are necessary.

Another thought: perhaps use the fact that airplanes can carry packages. So, when p1 is loaded into an airplane, it's considered "in" the airplane, but the airplane is in a location. So if the airplane is in l1_1, then p1 is in l1_1 when unloaded, but while in the airplane, it's in the airplane's location.

But constraint 5 requires p1 to be in l1_1 or t1. So unloading p1 into l1_1 satisfies it.

Thus, the initial approach is correct.

Given all this, the optimal plan is 19 steps. However, since the problem asks for an optimal plan with minimal steps, and I can't find a shorter one, I'll proceed to write the plan accordingly.
