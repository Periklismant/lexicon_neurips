Let me understand the problem. We have two cities c1 and c2, each with multiple locations. Some of these locations are airports. There are two trucks, two airplanes, and two packages. The goal is to have package p1 in location l1_2 and package p2 in location l1_4. There are also some additional constraints. Let's analyze these one by one.

First, let's identify the airports. From the problem statement, I can see that l1_1 is an airport in city c1, and l2_1 is an airport in city c2.

Now, let's look at the initial state:
- Location l1_1, l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5 are in city c1
- Location l2_1, l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5 are in city c2

Wait, there's something wrong with the initial state provided. It says "Package t1 is in location l1_5", "Package t2 is in location l2_4", "Package a1 is in location l1_1", "Package a2 is in location l2_1", but t1, t2, a1, and a2 are trucks and airplanes, not packages. Let me correct this:

- Truck t1 is in location l1_5
- Truck t2 is in location l2_4
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1
- Package p1 is in location l1_1
- Package p2 is in location l2_5

The goal is:
- Package p1 is in location l1_2
- Package p2 is in location l1_4

Now let's analyze the constraints:

1. "Package p2 is in location l2_5" must hold in at least one state. This is true in the initial state.

2. If "Package p2 is in location l2_5" holds in some state, then "Package p2 is in location l2_4" must hold at that state or some state after it. This means that after picking up p2 from l2_5, we must move it to l2_4 before doing anything else with it.

3. "Package p2 is in location l1_4" must hold in at least one state. This is part of our goal state.

4. If "Package p2 is in location l1_4" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which "Package p1 is in location l1_3" holds. This means we need to move p1 to l1_3 before moving p2 to l1_4.

5. "Package p1 is in location l1_3" must hold in at least one state. This is already covered by constraint 4.

So, we have a problem with two packages p1 and p2, and the goal is to get p1 to l1_2 and p2 to l1_4. But we also have constraints that we need to satisfy along the way. In a nutshell we need to:
1. Move p1 from l1_1 to l1_3 at some point.
2. Move p2 from l2_5 to l2_4 at some point after it's in l2_5.
3. Move p1 to l1_3 before moving p2 to l1_4.
4. Eventually get p1 to l1_2 and p2 to l1_4.

Let's now think about a high-level plan:

1. Move p1 from l1_1 to l1_3 (satisfying constraint 5).
2. Move p2 from l2_5 to l2_4 (satisfying constraint 2).
3. Move p2 from l2_4 to l1_4 (satisfying constraints 3 and 4, since p1 was already in l1_3 before p2 gets to l1_4).
4. Move p1 from l1_3 to l1_2 (satisfying the goal for p1).

Now, I need to think about how to implement this high-level plan using the available actions.

Moving p1 from l1_1 to l1_3:
- p1 is initially in l1_1.
- We can use truck t1 (which is in l1_5) to transport p1.
- We need to drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_1, load p1 into t1, drive t1 to l1_3, and unload p1.

Moving p2 from l2_5 to l2_4:
- p2 is initially in l2_5.
- We can use truck t2 (which is in l2_4) to transport p2.
- We need to drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_5, load p2 into t2, drive t2 back to l2_4, and unload p2.

Moving p2 from l2_4 to l1_4:
- After p2 is in l2_4, we can use airplane a2 (which is in l2_1) to transport p2 to city c1.
- We need to drive truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_1 with p2, unload p2, load it into a2, fly a2 to l1_1, unload p2, load it into truck t1, drive t1 to l1_4, and unload p2.

Moving p1 from l1_3 to l1_2:
- After p1 is in l1_3, we can use truck t1 to transport p1 to l1_2.
- We need to drive t1 from wherever it is (either l1_3 after dropping p1 off, or l1_4 after dropping p2 off) to l1_3, load p1 into t1, drive t1 to l1_2, and unload p1.

With this high-level plan, I want to make sure all constraints are satisfied:
- p2 is in l2_5 in the initial state (constraint 1).
- p2 moves from l2_5 to l2_4 (constraint 2).
- p1 is moved to l1_3 before p2 is moved to l1_4 (constraint 4).
- p2 is moved to l1_4 at some point (constraint 3).
- p1 is moved to l1_3 at some point (constraint 5).
- p1 ends up in l1_2 and p2 ends up in l1_4 (goal).

But hold on, there's an issue with my plan. After moving p1 to l1_3, I also need to move it to l1_2 to satisfy the goal. And after moving p2 to l2_4, I need to move it to l1_4.

Let me re-do our high-level plan to ensure we are able to satisfy the constraints and still handle the goal properly:
1. Move p1 from l1_1 to l1_3 (satisfying constraint 5).
2. Move p2 from l2_5 to l2_4 (satisfying constraint 2).
3. Move p2 from l2_4 to l1_4 (satisfying constraints 3 and 4, since p1 was already in l1_3 before p2 gets to l1_4, and part of the goal).
4. Move p1 from l1_3 to l1_2 (satisfying the remaining part of the goal).

Let's implement this high-level plan with the available actions:

1. Moving p1 from l1_1 to l1_3:
   - Drive truck t1 from l1_5 to l1_1.
   - Load p1 into t1 at l1_1.
   - Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_3.
   - Unload p1 from t1 at l1_3.

2. Moving p2 from l2_5 to l2_4:
   - Drive truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_5.
   - Load p2 into t2 at l2_5.
   - Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_4.
   - Unload p2 from t2 at l2_4.

3. Moving p2 from l2_4 to l1_4:
   - Load p2 into t2 at l2_4.
   - Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1 (the airport in city c2).
   - Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1.
   - Load p2 into airplane a2 at l2_1.
   - Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1 (the airport in city c1).
   - Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1.
   - Drive truck t1 from l1_3 to l1_1.
   - Load p2 into t1 at l1_1.
   - Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_4.
   - Unload p2 from t1 at l1_4.

4. Moving p1 from l1_3 to l1_2:
   - Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_3.
   - Load p1 into t1 at l1_3.
   - Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_2.
   - Unload p1 from t1 at l1_2.

Alright, this plan seems to satisfy all the constraints and goals. Let's verify:
- p2 is in l2_5 in the initial state (constraint 1).
- p2 moves from l2_5 to l2_4 (constraint 2).
- p1 is moved to l1_3 before p2 is moved to l1_4 (constraint 4).
- p2 is moved to l1_4 at some point (constraint 3).
- p1 is moved to l1_3 at some point (constraint 5).
- p1 ends up in l1_2 and p2 ends up in l1_4 (goal).

We've verified that this plan satisfies all constraints and goals. Let's now formalize this into a step-by-step plan with the correct action syntax:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
3. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
5. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2
6. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
7. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2
8. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
9. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
10. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
11. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
12. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
13. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
14. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
15. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
16. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
17. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
18. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
19. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1
20. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
21. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1
22. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2

Wait, there's some duplication of actions in our plan. Step 8 unloads p2 from truck t2 at l2_4, but then step 9 immediately loads it back in. This is redundant, so we can simplify the plan by removing steps 8 and 9:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
3. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
5. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2
6. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
7. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2
8. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
9. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
10. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
11. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
12. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
13. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
14. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
15. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
16. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
17. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1
18. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
19. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1
20. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2

However, I realize that I am skipping an important constraint 2: If expression "Package p2 is in location l2_5" holds in some state s, then expression "Package p2 is in location l2_4" must hold at s or at some state after s. This constraint doesn't mean we need to specifically move p2 to l2_4 after it's in l2_5; it means p2 should be in l2_4 at some point after it's in l2_5. 

Given that p2 starts in l2_5, the constraint requires that it be in l2_4 at some point after the initial state. Our current plan has the truck picking up p2 from l2_5 and driving to l2_4, but we don't actually unload p2 in l2_4. But the constraint says "Package p2 is in location l2_4" holds, which means p2 must be unloaded in l2_4 at some point. So we should modify our plan to include this:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
3. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
5. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2
6. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
7. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2
8. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4  # This ensures p2 is in l2_4 at some point after being in l2_5
9. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
10. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
11. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
12. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
13. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
14. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
15. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
16. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
17. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
18. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
19. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1
20. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
21. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1
22. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2

I think this ensures all constraints are satisfied.

Upon further reflection, wait, I am not sure that satisfies the constraint. The problem statement is: "If expression 'Package p2 is in location l2_5' holds in some state s, then expression 'Package p2 is in location l2_4' must hold at s or at some state after s. So I think my earlier understanding was correct: At some point after p2 is in l2_5, p2 must be in l2_4. This doesn't necessarily say "immediately after"; it could be several states later, which is what our plan currently does.

Let's clarify one more time what the constraint means:
- "Package p2 is in location l2_5" holds in state s: This means p2 is in l2_5.
- "Package p2 is in location l2_4" must hold at s: This means p2 is in l2_4 at the same time as it's in l2_5, which is impossible.
- OR
- "Package p2 is in location l2_4" must hold at some state after s: This means at some point after p2 is in l2_5, it should be in l2_4.

I think my original plan correctly addresses this constraint. Since p2 starts in l2_5, and we move it to l2_4 (either inside truck t2 or unloaded in l2_4), this constraint is satisfied. Let me be very careful here. What the constraint is saying is the position of the package, not the truck. So it sounds like while the truck moves from l2_5 to l2_4 with the package in it, the package is still in the truck, not at location l2_4. We would need to unload the package at l2_4 before sending it to l1_4 to satisfy this constraint.

Ok so I think in summary my plan should actually look like:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1   # Move truck t1 to the airport in city c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1        # Load package p1 into truck t1
3. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1   # Move truck t1 to location l1_3 in city c1
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3      # Unload package p1 from truck t1 (satisfying constraint 5)
5. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2   # Move truck t2 to location l2_5 in city c2
6. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5        # Load package p2 into truck t2
7. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2   # Move truck t2 to location l2_4 in city c2
8. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4      # Unload package p2 from truck t2 (satisfying constraint 2)
9. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4        # Load package p2 into truck t2 again
10. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2  # Move truck t2 to the airport in city c2
11. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1     # Unload package p2 from truck t2
12. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1    # Load package p2 into airplane a2
13. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1   # Fly airplane a2 to the airport in city c1
14. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1  # Unload package p2 from airplane a2
15. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1  # Move truck t1 to the airport in city c1
16. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1       # Load package p2 into truck t1
17. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1  # Move truck t1 to location l1_4 in city c1
18. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4     # Unload package p2 from truck t1 (satisfying constraint 3 and part of the goal)
19. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1  # Move truck t1 to location l1_3 in city c1
20. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3       # Load package p1 into truck t1
21. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1  # Move truck t1 to location l1_2 in city c1
22. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2     # Unload package p1 from truck t1 (satisfying the other part of the goal)

Wait, I think one thing is off. I just re-read more carefully and I think I misunderstood one of the constraints. The constraint says "If expression 'Package p2 is in location l1_4' holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 'Package p1 is in location l1_3'".

This means that before p2 is in l1_4, p1 must have been in l1_3. This doesn't mean p1 needs to be in l1_3 directly before p2 is in l1_4; it just means at some point before p2 gets to l1_4, p1 must have been in l1_3.

As a sanity check, let's review the constraints and see if they're satisfied by our plan:

1. "Package p2 is in location l2_5" must hold in at least one state. 
   This is true in the initial state.

2. If "Package p2 is in location l2_5" holds in some state, then "Package p2 is in location l2_4" must hold at that state or some state after it. 
   This is satisfied by steps 5-8, where we move p2 from l2_5 to l2_4.

3. "Package p2 is in location l1_4" must hold in at least one state. 
   This is satisfied by step 18, where we unload p2 in l1_4.

4. If "Package p2 is in location l1_4" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which "Package p1 is in location l1_3" holds. 
   This is satisfied because p1 is moved to l1_3 in step 4, which is before p2 is moved to l1_4 in step 18.

5. "Package p1 is in location l1_3" must hold in at least one state. 
   This is satisfied by step 4, where we unload p1 in l1_3.

6. The goal state requires that p1 is in l1_2 and p2 is in l1_4. 
   This is satisfied by steps 18 and 22.

Yes, all constraints are satisfied by our plan. I think this plan is correct and optimal.

Actually, let me think about optimality again. Let's see if I can optimize the plan further.

The current plan has 22 steps, but I'm wondering if we can reduce it. 

One possible optimization is that we don't need to unload and reload p2 at l2_4 (steps 8 and 9). We just need to make sure p2 is in l2_4 at some point, and one way to satisfy this is to unload it there. But once it's unloaded, we need to load it again to continue its journey. Maybe there's a more efficient way to satisfy this constraint?

Wait, the constraint says "Package p2 is in location l2_4" must hold at state s or at some state after s, where s is any state in which "Package p2 is in location l2_5" holds. This means that after p2 is in l2_5, it must be in l2_4 at some point. "Package p2 is in location l2_4" means p2 is physically at l2_4, not inside a truck or airplane at l2_4.

So, I think the steps I have are correct. We need to unload p2 in l2_4 to satisfy constraint 2, and then load it again to continue its journey.

Let's check if there's any other way to optimize the plan. Maybe we can reduce the number of truck movements?

Hmm, actually, there could be a shorter plan. Since both p1 and p2 need to be in city c1 at the end, maybe we can use the airplanes more efficiently? Let me think about an alternative plan:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1   # Move truck t1 to the airport in city c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1        # Load package p1 into truck t1
3. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1   # Move truck t1 to location l1_3 in city c1
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3      # Unload package p1 from truck t1 (satisfying constraint 5)
5. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2   # Move truck t2 to location l2_5 in city c2
6. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5        # Load package p2 into truck t2
7. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2   # Move truck t2 to location l2_4 in city c2
8. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4      # Unload package p2 from truck t2 (satisfying constraint 2)
9. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4        # Load package p2 into truck t2 again
10. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2  # Move truck t2 to the airport in city c2
11. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1     # Unload package p2 from truck t2
12. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1    # Load package p2 into airplane a2
13. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1   # Fly airplane a2 to the airport in city c1
14. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1  # Unload package p2 from airplane a2
15. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1  # Move truck t1 to the airport in city c1
16. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1       # Load package p2 into truck t1
17. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1  # Move truck t1 to location l1_4 in city c1
18. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4     # Unload package p2 from truck t1 (satisfying constraint 3 and part of the goal)
19. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1  # Move truck t1 to location l1_3 in city c1
20. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3       # Load package p1 into truck t1
21. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1  # Move truck t1 to location l1_2 in city c1
22. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2     # Unload package p1 from truck t1 (satisfying the other part of the goal)

I've revisited the plan and I think it's actually pretty close to optimal. Let me think about if there's any other way to further optimize it.

Actually, let me consider a scenario where we also use airplane a1, which is initially at l1_1. 

On second thought, using airplane a1 doesn't seem to offer any advantage.

Let me check if there's any redundancy in the truck movements:

After dropping off p1 in l1_3, truck t1 moves to l1_1, then to l1_4, then back to l1_3, then to l1_2. Is there a more efficient way to do this? Unfortunately, I think these movements are necessary because:
1. We need to pick up p2 from the airport l1_1.
2. We need to drop off p2 at l1_4.
3. We need to pick up p1 from l1_3.
4. We need to drop off p1 at l1_2.

Given the sequence of events, I think the truck movements are efficient. 

What about truck t2? It moves from l2_4 to l2_5, back to l2_4, and then to l2_1. This is also efficient given the constraints.

I believe the plan I've laid out is indeed optimal.

Actually, let me think if any of these steps can be done in parallel to reduce the overall time (though this doesn't reduce the number of actions). For instance, while truck t1 is moving package p1 in city c1, truck t2 can be moving package p2 in city c2. While the airplanes are flying, the trucks can be repositioning, etc. 

However, I'm not asked to provide a parallel plan, and the objective is to provide a valid sequence of actions with the minimum number of steps. I believe the plan I've laid out meets this criterion.

But wait, let's verify one more time? Are steps 8 and 9 redundant? If we unload p2 from truck t2 at l2_4 only to immediately load it back into the truck, isn't that redundant?

Wait actually it's incorrect to say the action of unloading and loading the package at l2_4 is redundant.

The constraint 2 says "If expression 'Package p2 is in location l2_5' holds in some state s, then expression 'Package p2 is in location l2_4' must hold at s or at some state after s."

In our plan, p2 starts in l2_5, so the condition of this constraint is met. Then the constraint requires that at some point after p2 is in l2_5, it should be in l2_4.

To satisfy the constraint, p2 must physically be at l2_4 (not inside a truck or airplane at l2_4). This means we need to unload it from truck t2 at l2_4. But since the goal is to eventually get p2 to l1_4, we need to then load it back into the truck to continue its journey. 

So, steps 8 and 9 are not redundant; they are necessary to satisfy constraint 2. Steps 8 and 9 are basically stating:
- Step 8: Unload p2 from t2 at l2_4 (now p2 is at l2_4, satisfying constraint 2).
- Step 9: Load p2 into t2 at l2_4 (to continue its journey to the goal).

Therefore, I believe the 22-step plan is indeed optimal.

Actually, I just realized I was right when I thought of redundancy. Let me rethink the situation. The constraint states that at some state after p2 is in l2_5, p2 should be in l2_4. The constraint is about the package's presence in the location, not the condition of the package inside or outside a vehicle.

Hmm I think technically the package can be in l2_4 even without unloading. Let's check what the problem statement says about the effects of drivetruck: "After moving a truck t from location l_from to location l_to in a city c, (i) t is no longer situated in l_from, and (ii) t is situated in l_to."

If a truck is situated in a location, is a package inside that truck also considered to be in that location? I'm not sure, but to be safe, I'll assume that a package inside a truck is not considered to be in the location where the truck is. This would mean that to satisfy the constraint, we need to unload p2 from the truck at l2_4, which is what my plan does.

Actually, let me think about this more carefully. The condition "Package p2 is in location l2_4" means that p2 is physically at l2_4, not inside a truck or airplane at l2_4. This is because the problem statement makes it clear that a package can either be in a location or inside a vehicle, but not both simultaneously. 

For instance, the effects of the loadtruck action state: "After loading a package p in a truck t at a location l, (i) p is no longer situated in l, and (ii) p is in t." This implies that once a package is loaded into a truck, it's no longer considered to be in the location. The reverse is also true, check the effect of unloadtruck: "After unloading a package p from a truck t in a location l, (i) p is no longer in t, and (ii) p is situated in l." 

Given these clarifications, to satisfy constraint 2, p2 must be unloaded from truck t2 at l2_4. So, steps 8 and 9 are not redundant but necessary.

I'll stick with the 22-step plan as the optimal solution.

Actually, I think I should take a step back and think about the order of operations a bit more. Is there a more efficient way to move these packages to their destinations?

Looking at the current plan, are those 22 steps really all needed?

Constraint 5 says "Package p1 is in location l1_3" must hold in at least one state. This means we need to move p1 to l1_3 at some point.

Constraint 4 says if "Package p2 is in location l1_4" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which "Package p1 is in location l1_3" holds. This means we need to move p1 to l1_3 before moving p2 to l1_4.

Constraint 2 says if "Package p2 is in location l2_5" holds in some state, then "Package p2 is in location l2_4" must hold at that state or some state after it. This means after p2 is in l2_5, it must be in l2_4 at some point.

The goal is to move p1 to l1_2 and p2 to l1_4.

Hmm, actually I do think my plan is optimal. Let's formalize the final plan:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1   # Move truck t1 to the airport in city c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1        # Load package p1 into truck t1
3. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1   # Move truck t1 to location l1_3 in city c1
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3      # Unload package p1 from truck t1 (satisfying constraint 5)
5. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2   # Move truck t2 to location l2_5 in city c2
6. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5        # Load package p2 into truck t2
7. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2   # Move truck t2 to location l2_4 in city c2
8. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4      # Unload package p2 from truck t2 (satisfying constraint 2)
9. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4        # Load package p2 into truck t2 again
10. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2  # Move truck t2 to the airport in city c2
11. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1     # Unload package p2 from truck t2
12. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1    # Load package p2 into airplane a2
13. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1   # Fly airplane a2 to the airport in city c1
14. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1  # Unload package p2 from airplane a2
15. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1  # Move truck t1 to the airport in city c1
16. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1       # Load package p2 into truck t1
17. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1  # Move truck t1 to location l1_4 in city c1
18. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4     # Unload package p2 from truck t1 (satisfying constraint 3 and part of the goal)
19. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1  # Move truck t1 to location l1_3 in city c1
20. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3       # Load package p1 into truck t1
21. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1  # Move truck t1 to location l1_2 in city c1
22. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2     # Unload package p1 from truck t1 (satisfying the other part of the goal)

OK so I think I understand the constraints now:
1. "Package p2 is in location l2_5" must hold in at least one state. 
   This is true in the initial state.

2. If "Package p2 is in location l2_5" holds in some state s, then "Package p2 is in location l2_4" must hold at s or at some state after s. 
   This requires that at some point after p2 is in l2_5, p2 is unloaded in l2_4 (not just inside a truck at l2_4). However I remember I misunderstood it at first because I thought package p2 needs to be in location l2_4 in the normal sense, i.e., it needs to be physically at l2_4, not inside a truck or airplane.

3. If "Package p2 is in location l1_4" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which "Package p1 is in location l1_3" holds. 
   This requires that p1 be unloaded in l1_3 before p2 is unloaded in l1_4. Note that "Package p2 is in location l1_4" holds when p2 is physically at l1_4, not when it's inside a truck that's at l1_4.

4. "Package p1 is in location l1_3" must hold in at least one state. 
   This requires that p1 be unloaded in l1_3 at some point.

The goal is to move p1 to l1_2 and p2 to l1_4.

Given these clarifications, I think our plan does correctly satisfy all constraints and the goal.

OK but I need to be careful. I need to clarify if "Package p is in location l" means "Package p is physically at location l" (not inside a truck or airplane at l). From the problem statement, the loadtruck action has the effect: "After loading a package p in a truck t at a location l, (i) p is no longer situated in l, and (ii) p is in t." This suggests that, after loading, the package is in the truck, not in the location. Similarly, the unloadtruck action has the effect: "After unloading a package p from a truck t in a location l, (i) p is no longer in t, and (ii) p is situated in l." This suggests that, after unloading, the package is situated in the location, not in the truck. Also let's carefully check the initial state, which mentions like "Package p1 is in location l1_1", not inside a truck or plane.

Based on this, the expression "Package p is in location l" indeed means that p is physically at location l, not inside a truck or airplane at l.

With this understanding, do we need steps 8 and 9?

Constraint 2 says if "Package p2 is in location l2_5" holds in some state, then "Package p2 is in location l2_4" must hold at that state or some state after it. So after p2 is in l2_5, it must be physically at l2_4 at some point. If p2 is inside truck t2 at l2_4, the expression "Package p2 is in location l2_4" doesn't hold. To satisfy constraint 2, we must unload p2 from truck t2 at l2_4. But then, since the goal is to get p2 to l1_4, we need to load it back into the truck to continue its journey. So, steps 8 and 9 are necessary.

Similar reasoning applies to the other constraints. So I believe our plan is correct to satisfy all the constraints as stated.

OK, I think my plan is correct. Let me quickly check if there any other changes I'd like to make, but we're on the right track overall.

Hmm, I realized one thing that I'm still questioning. Are the 22 actions optimal? Can we do better?

Actually I think we can actually make it slightly more optimal. Originally I wrote:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1   # Move truck t1 to the airport in city c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1        # Load package p1 into truck t1
3. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1   # Move truck t1 to location l1_3 in city c1
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3      # Unload package p1 from truck t1 (satisfying constraint 5)
5. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2   # Move truck t2 to location l2_5 in city c2
6. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5        # Load package p2 into truck t2
7. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2   # Move truck t2 to location l2_4 in city c2
8. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4      # Unload package p2 from truck t2 (satisfying constraint 2)
9. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4        # Load package p2 into truck t2 again
10. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2  # Move truck t2 to the airport in city c2
11. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1     # Unload package p2 from truck t2
12. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1    # Load package p2 into airplane a2
13. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1   # Fly airplane a2 to the airport in city c1
14. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1  # Unload package p2 from airplane a2
15. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1  # Move truck t1 to the airport in city c1
16. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1       # Load package p2 into truck t1
17. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1  # Move truck t1 to location l1_4 in city c1
18. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4     # Unload package p2 from truck t1 (satisfying constraint 3 and part of the goal)
19. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1  # Move truck t1 to location l1_3 in city c1
20. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3       # Load package p1 into truck t1
21. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1  # Move truck t1 to location l1_2 in city c1
22. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2     # Unload package p1 from truck t1 (satisfying the other part of the goal)

But actually if I drive truck t1 to l1_2 first, then I can avoid having to drive it to l1_3, then to l1_1, then to l1_4, then back to l1_3 then to l1_2. So consider the following alternative plan:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1   # Move truck t1 to the airport in city c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1        # Load package p1 into truck t1
3. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1   # Move truck t1 to location l1_3 in city c1
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3      # Unload package p1 from truck t1 (satisfying constraint 5)
5. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1   # Move truck t1 to location l1_2 in city c1
6. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2   # Move truck t2 to location l2_5 in city c2
7. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5        # Load package p2 into truck t2
8. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2   # Move truck t2 to location l2_4 in city c2
9. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4      # Unload package p2 from truck t2 (satisfying constraint 2)
10. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4       # Load package p2 into truck t2 again
11. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2  # Move truck t2 to the airport in city c2
12. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1     # Unload package p2 from truck t2
13. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1    # Load package p2 into airplane a2
14. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1   # Fly airplane a2 to the airport in city c1
15. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1  # Unload package p2 from airplane a2
16. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1  # Move truck t1 to the airport in city c1
17. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1       # Load package p2 into truck t1
18. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1  # Move truck t1 to location l1_4 in city c1
19. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4     # Unload package p2 from truck t1 (satisfying constraint 3 and part of the goal)
20. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1  # Move truck t1 to location l1_3 in city c1
21. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3       # Load package p1 into truck t1
22. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1  # Move truck t1 to location l1_2 in city c1
23. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2     # Unload package p1 from truck t1 (satisfying the other part of the goal)

Hm, that actually has one extra step, so it's not more optimal.

Let's see. Truck t1 is going from l1_5 to l1_1 to l1_3, then to l1_1, then to l1_4, then to l1_3, then to l1_2. So we're going to l1_3 twice, which seems inefficient.

Actually, I think it would be more efficient if truck t1 doesn't drop off p1 at l1_3 first, but rather keeps it in the truck until we need to unload at l1_2. Oh wait, that wouldn't work, we need to drop p1 at l1_3 to satisfy constraint 5. 

But wait a minute, shouldn't truck t1 just go from l1_3 to l1_2 with p1, drop p1 off, then head to the airport (l1_1) to pick up p2? This would save us a step.

Let me re-explore the plan:
- Truck t1 (which is initially at l1_5) needs to pick up p1 (which is initially at l1_1). To do this:
  1. t1 moves from l1_5 to l1_1.
  2. t1 loads p1.

- Since we need to have p1 at l1_3 at some point (constraint 5), we move t1 to l1_3 with p1 and unload p1.
  3. t1 moves from l1_1 to l1_3.
  4. t1 unloads p1.

- Now that p1 is unloaded in l1_3 (satisfying constraint 5), we no longer need t1 right now. We can focus on moving p2 in city c2. Truck t2 needs to pick up p2 from l2_5, but t2 is initially at l2_4. To do this:
  5. t2 moves from l2_4 to l2_5.
  6. t2 loads p2.

- Due to constraint 2, after p2 is in l2_5, it needs to be in l2_4 at some point. So we move t2 to l2_4 with p2 and unload p2.
  7. t2 moves from l2_5 to l2_4.
  8. t2 unloads p2.

- Since we need to eventually get p2 to l1_4, we load p2 back into t2 and move it to the airport in city c2 (l2_1).
  9. t2 loads p2.
  10. t2 moves from l2_4 to l2_1.
  11. t2 unloads p2.

- To get p2 to city c1, we use airplane a2. (Initially, a2 is at l2_1, the airport in city c2.)
  12. a2 loads p2.
  13. a2 flies from l2_1 to l1_1.
  14. a2 unloads p2.

- To get p2 from the airport in city c1 (l1_1) to its goal location (l1_4), we use truck t1. (Note: t1 is currently at l1_3 after dropping off p1).
  15. t1 moves from l1_3 to l1_1.
  16. t1 loads p2.
  17. t1 moves from l1_1 to l1_4.
  18. t1 unloads p2.

- Lastly, to get p1 from l1_3 to its goal location (l1_2), we use truck t1 again.
  19. t1 moves from l1_4 to l1_3.
  20. t1 loads p1.
  21. t1 moves from l1_3 to l1_2.
  22. t1 unloads p1.

It seems like our original plan with 22 steps is indeed optimal.

Actually, hold on. I think I'm missing something. 

After unloading p1 in l1_3, instead of immediately going to pick up p2 from the airport, couldn't we leave p1 in l1_3, drive t1 to l1_2, then come back to pick up p1, drive to l1_2 and drop it off? No, check constraint 4.

Constraint 4 says if "Package p2 is in location l1_4" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which "Package p1 is in location l1_3" holds. So, p1 must be in l1_3 before p2 is in l1_4.

Given our current plan, after p1 is in l1_3, our next action is to use truck t2 and airplane a2 to get p2 to l1_1. Then we use truck t1 to move p2 from l1_1 to l1_4. Once p2 is in l1_4, we move p1 from l1_3 to l1_2. This order of actions ensures that p1 is in l1_3 before p2 is in l1_4.

Actually, wait, the truck doesn't need to pick up p1 after dropping p2 in l1_4. Let me think through this again.

Wait, but we need to move p1 from l1_3 to l1_2 to satisfy the goal. So after dropping p2 in l1_4, truck t1 has to go back to l1_3, pick up p1, and move it to l1_2.

I think our original plan with 22 steps is indeed optimal. Let's review once more:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1   # Move truck t1 to the airport in city c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1        # Load package p1 into truck t1
3. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1   # Move truck t1 to location l1_3 in city c1
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3      # Unload package p1 from truck t1 (satisfying constraint 5)
5. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2   # Move truck t2 to location l2_5 in city c2
6. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5        # Load package p2 into truck t2
7. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2   # Move truck t2 to location l2_4 in city c2
8. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4      # Unload package p2 from truck t2 (satisfying constraint 2)
9. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4        # Load package p2 into truck t2 again
10. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2  # Move truck t2 to the airport in city c2
11. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1     # Unload package p2 from truck t2
12. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1    # Load package p2 into airplane a2
13. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1   # Fly airplane a2 to the airport in city c1
14. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1  # Unload package p2 from airplane a2
15. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1  # Move truck t1 to the airport in city c1
16. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1       # Load package p2 into truck t1
17. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1  # Move truck t1 to location l1_4 in city c1
18. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4     # Unload package p2 from truck t1 (satisfying constraint 3 and part of the goal)
19. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1  # Move truck t1 to location l1_3 in city c1
20. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3       # Load package p1 into truck t1
21. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1  # Move truck t1 to location l1_2 in city c1
22. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2     # Unload package p1 from truck t1 (satisfying the other part of the goal)

Let me double check that all the constraints are satisfied:

Constraint 1: "Package p2 is in location l2_5" must hold in at least one state.
This is true in the initial state.

Constraint 2: If "Package p2 is in location l2_5" holds in some state, then "Package p2 is in location l2_4" must hold at that state or some state after it.
This is satisfied by steps 7-8, where we move p2 from l2_5 to l2_4 and then unload it.

Constraint 3: "Package p2 is in location l1_4" must hold in at least one state.
This is satisfied by step 18, where we unload p2 in l1_4.

Constraint 4: If "Package p2 is in location l1_4" holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which "Package p1 is in location l1_3" holds.
This is satisfied because p1 is moved to l1_3 in step 4, which is before p2 is moved to l1_4 in step 18.

Constraint 5: "Package p1 is in location l1_3" must hold in at least one state.
This is satisfied by step 4, where we unload p1 in l1_3.

So all constraints are satisfied. Additionally, the goal of p1 being in l1_2 and p2 being in l1_4 is also satisfied by the end of the plan. So I believe the 22-step plan is the optimal solution to the given problem.

Oh wait, looking at the problem I notice I made a typo in the unloadairplane action. Let me include the correct one. Actually let's just double check all the actions:

- loadtruck p t l: Load package p in truck t. Both p and t are in location l.
- loadairplane p ap l: Load package p in airplane ap. Both p and ap are in location l.
- unloadtruck p t l: Unload package p from truck t in location l.
- unloadairplane p ap l: Unload package p from airplane ap in location l.
- drivetruck t l_from l_to c: Drive truck t from location l_from to location l_to in city c.
- flyairplane ap l_from l_to: Fly airplane ap from location l_from to location l_to.

Ok I had a typo and mistakenly wrote "loadairplane p ap l" twice instead of "unloadairplane". So the correct version should be "unloadairplane p ap l", which is what my plan does. So my plan is correct.

Let me give the full plan once more just to make sure there are no other errors:
