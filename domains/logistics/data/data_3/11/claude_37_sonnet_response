Let me analyze this planning problem:

1. We have a logistics domain with two cities (c1 and c2), multiple locations in each city, airports, trucks, airplanes, and packages.
2. We want to move package p1 from its initial location (l2_1) to location l2_2.
3. We have constraints that must be satisfied:
   a. p1 must be in truck t2 at some point
   b. Before p1 is in t2, it must have been in either airplane a2 or truck t1
   c. p1 must be in location l1_8 at some point
   d. p1 must be in airplane a2 at some point

First, let me clarify the initial state:
- Package p1 is in location l2_1 (which is an airport in city c2)
- Truck t1 is in location l1_8 (in city c1)
- Truck t2 is in location l2_1 (in city c2)
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (airport in city c1)
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1 (airport in city c2)

The goal is to have p1 in location l2_2.

Given the constraints, I must:
1. Move p1 to location l1_8 at some point
2. Put p1 in airplane a2 at some point
3. Put p1 in truck t2 at some point, but only after it has been in either a2 or t1

I'm going to sketch out a plan that satisfies all these constraints:

1. First, load p1 into a2 at l2_1 (both are there initially)
2. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1 (between airports)
3. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1
4. Load p1 into truck t1 (we need to get t1 to l1_1 first)
   - Drive t1 from l1_8 to l1_1
   - Load p1 into t1 at l1_1
5. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_8 (to satisfy constraint that p1 must be in location l1_8)
6. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_8
7. Load p1 back into t1 at l1_8
8. Drive t1 from l1_8 to l1_1 (to reach the airport)
9. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1
10. Load p1 into a2 again at l1_1
11. Fly a2 from l1_1 to l2_1
12. Unload p1 from a2 at l2_1
13. Load p1 into t2 at l2_1 (this satisfies the constraint that p1 must be in t2, and it happens after p1 was in both a2 and t1)
14. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2
15. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_2 (achieving our goal)

Let me check if this plan satisfies all constraints:
- p1 is in t2 at step 13 ✓
- Before p1 is in t2, it was in a2 (steps 1-3 and 10-12) and t1 (steps 4-9) ✓
- p1 is in location l1_8 at step 6 ✓
- p1 is in a2 at steps 1-2 and 10-11 ✓

Now let me formalize the plan with the given action format:

Wait, I notice there's a typo in the actions. The "loadairplane" action appears twice - once correctly and once where "unloadairplane" should be. I'll use the correct action names based on the descriptions:

I'm also noticing some confusion in the initial state. It says "Package t1 is in location l1_8" and "Package t2 is in location l2_1" which doesn't make sense since t1 and t2 are trucks, not packages. Let me assume these are typos and the intended meaning is:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_8
- Truck t2 is in location l2_1

Similarly, it says "Package a1 is in location l1_1" and "Package a2 is in location l2_1" which should be:
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

With these corrections, let me refine my plan.

Let me write out the formal plan:

1. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
2. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
3. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
4. drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_1 c1
5. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
6. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_8 c1
7. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_8
8. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_8
9. drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_1 c1
10. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
11. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
12. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
13. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
14. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
15. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
16. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

Actually, the plan above has some redundant steps. Let me optimize it:

1. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
2. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
3. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
4. drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_1 c1
5. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
6. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_8 c1
7. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_8
8. drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_1 c1
9. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_8  (This is incorrect - I need to get p1 to l1_1 first)

Hmm, it seems I made a mistake. Let me redo this carefully:

1. We need p1 to be in l1_8 at some point, but it starts in l2_1
2. We need p1 to be in a2 at some point
3. We need p1 to be in t2 at some point, but only after it's been in a2 or t1
4. Ultimately p1 needs to end up in l2_2

Let me trace through the position of all objects and ensure the plan is valid:

Initial state:
- p1 is at l2_1
- t1 is at l1_8
- t2 is at l2_1
- a1 is at l1_1
- a2 is at l2_1

I think I need to use t1 to move p1 to l1_8, but t1 starts in l1_8 and p1 starts in l2_1. I need to use an airplane to get p1 from city c2 to city c1.

Updated plan:

1. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (p1 and a2 are both at l2_1)
   - After: p1 is in a2, which is at l2_1
2. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (a2 flies from l2_1 to l1_1)
   - After: a2 is at l1_1 with p1
3. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (p1 is unloaded from a2 at l1_1)
   - After: p1 is at l1_1, a2 is at l1_1
4. drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_1 c1 (t1 drives from l1_8 to l1_1)
   - After: t1 is at l1_1, p1 is at l1_1
5. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (p1 is loaded into t1 at l1_1)
   - After: p1 is in t1, which is at l1_1
6. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_8 c1 (t1 drives from l1_1 to l1_8)
   - After: t1 is at l1_8 with p1 inside
7. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_8 (p1 is unloaded from t1 at l1_8)
   - After: p1 is at l1_8, t1 is at l1_8
   (This satisfies the constraint that p1 must be in l1_8 at some point)
8. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_8 (p1 is loaded back into t1 at l1_8)
   - After: p1 is in t1, which is at l1_8
9. drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_1 c1 (t1 drives from l1_8 to l1_1)
   - After: t1 is at l1_1 with p1 inside
10. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (p1 is unloaded from t1 at l1_1)
    - After: p1 is at l1_1, t1 is at l1_1
11. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (p1 is loaded into a2 at l1_1)
    - After: p1 is in a2, which is at l1_1
12. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1 (a2 flies from l1_1 to l2_1)
    - After: a2 is at l2_1 with p1 inside
13. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (p1 is unloaded from a2 at l2_1)
    - After: p1 is at l2_1, a2 is at l2_1
14. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (p1 is loaded into t2 at l2_1)
    - After: p1 is in t2, which is at l2_1
    (This satisfies the constraint that p1 must be in t2 at some point, and it occurs after p1 was in both a2 and t1)
15. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2 (t2 drives from l2_1 to l2_2)
    - After: t2 is at l2_2 with p1 inside
16. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (p1 is unloaded from t2 at l2_2)
    - After: p1 is at l2_2, t2 is at l2_2
    (This achieves our goal)

This plan satisfies all the constraints:
- p1 is in t2 at step 14
- Before p1 is in t2, it was in a2 (steps 1-3 and 11-13) and t1 (steps 5-10)
- p1 is in location l1_8 at step 7
- p1 is in a2 at steps 1-2 and 11-12

However, there are a couple of inefficient segments. Let's optimize it further:

Actually, let me critically review this plan to make sure it works.

Steps 7-8 (unloading p1 at l1_8 and immediately loading it back into t1) are necessary to satisfy the constraint that p1 must be in location l1_8 at some point.

The moving of p1 from c2 to c1 and back to c2 is necessary because:
1. p1 needs to be in l1_8 at some point (which is in city c1)
2. p1 starts in l2_1 (city c2) and needs to end in l2_2 (also in city c2)

Wait, I just realized there's a problem with step 11. After unloading p1 at l1_1, I load it into a2 at l1_1, but in step 9, I drove t1 from l1_8 to l1_1, which means p1 is at l1_1. However, to satisfy the constraint that p1 must be in a2 at some point, I need to load it into a2.

Let me double-check the plan again:

1. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
   - After: p1 is in a2 at l2_1 (satisfies constraint: p1 must be in a2)
2. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
   - After: p1 is in a2 at l1_1
3. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
   - After: p1 is at l1_1, a2 is at l1_1
4. drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_1 c1
   - After: t1 is at l1_1
5. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
   - After: p1 is in t1 at l1_1
6. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_8 c1
   - After: p1 is in t1 at l1_8
7. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_8
   - After: p1 is at l1_8 (satisfies constraint: p1 must be in l1_8)
8. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_8
   - After: p1 is in t1 at l1_8
9. drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_1 c1
   - After: p1 is in t1 at l1_1
10. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
    - After: p1 is at l1_1
11. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
    - After: p1 is in a2 at l1_1 (satisfies constraint: p1 must be in a2)
12. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
    - After: p1 is in a2 at l2_1
13. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
    - After: p1 is at l2_1
14. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
    - After: p1 is in t2 at l2_1 (satisfies constraint: p1 must be in t2 after being in a2 or t1)
15. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
    - After: p1 is in t2 at l2_2
16. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
    - After: p1 is at l2_2 (goal achieved)

This looks correct. Let me check one more time:

The constraints are:
1. Package p1 is in t2 at some point - satisfied in step 14
2. Before p1 is in t2, it must have been in either a2 or t1 - p1 was in a2 in steps 1-2 and 11-12, and in t1 in steps 5-9
3. Package p1 is in location l1_8 at some point - satisfied in step 7
4. Package p1 is in airplane a2 at some point - satisfied in steps 1-2 and 11-12

All constraints are satisfied, and the goal is achieved. This is a valid plan.

In terms of optimization, I don't think we can make the plan shorter while still satisfying all the constraints:
- We need to move p1 from city c2 to city c1 and back (requiring air travel both ways)
- We need p1 to be in l1_8 at some point (requiring truck travel from the airport)
- We need p1 to be in both a2 and t1 before it's in t2

So this seems to be an optimal plan given the constraints.

Actually, let me think if there's a more optimal plan:

What if we:
1. Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1
2. Fly a2 to l1_1
3. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1
4. Have t1 drive from l1_8 to l1_1
5. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_1
6. Have t1 drive from l1_1 to l1_8 with p1
7. Unload p1 at l1_8
8. Have t1 drive back to l1_1
9. Have a2 fly from l1_1 to l2_1
10. Have t2 drive from l2_1 to l1_1
11. Load p1 onto t2 at l1_8
12. Have t2 drive from l1_8 to l1_1
13. Have t2 drive from l1_1 to l2_1 (but wait, t2 can only drive in city c2, not c1)

No, this doesn't work because trucks can only drive within a city. The plan I outlined earlier is optimal.

Let me finalize the formal plan:

```
loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_1 c1
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_8 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_8
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_8
drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_1 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
```

Wait, I noticed a typo in the actions. One of the actions is listed as "loadairplane p ap l" twice, where the second one should be "unloadairplane p ap l". I'll use the correct action names in my final answer.

Now, I'm reviewing one more time to ensure the plan is optimal and valid:

Initial state:
- p1 is at l2_1
- t1 is at l1_8
- t2 is at l2_1
- a1 is at l1_1
- a2 is at l2_1

1. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (p1 and a2 are both at l2_1)
   - After: p1 is in a2, satisfying constraint that p1 must be in a2
2. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (a2 flies from l2_1 to l1_1)
   - After: a2 is at l1_1 with p1 inside
3. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (p1 is unloaded from a2 at l1_1)
   - After: p1 is at l1_1, a2 is at l1_1
4. drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_1 c1 (t1 drives from l1_8 to l1_1)
   - After: t1 is at l1_1, p1 is at l1_1
5. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (p1 is loaded into t1 at l1_1)
   - After: p1 is in t1, satisfying constraint that p1 must be in t1 before being in t2
6. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_8 c1 (t1 drives from l1_1 to l1_8)
   - After: t1 is at l1_8 with p1 inside
7. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_8 (p1 is unloaded from t1 at l1_8)
   - After: p1 is at l1_8, satisfying constraint that p1 must be in l1_8
8. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_8 (p1 is loaded back into t1 at l1_8)
   - After: p1 is in t1
9. drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_1 c1 (t1 drives from l1_8 to l1_1)
   - After: t1 is at l1_1 with p1 inside
10. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (p1 is unloaded from t1 at l1_1)
    - After: p1 is at l1_1, t1 is at l1_1
11. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (p1 is loaded into a2 at l1_1)
    - After: p1 is in a2, reinforcing constraint that p1 must be in a2
12. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1 (a2 flies from l1_1 to l2_1)
    - After: a2 is at l2_1 with p1 inside
13. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (p1 is unloaded from a2 at l2_1)
    - After: p1 is at l2_1, a2 is at l2_1
14. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (p1 is loaded into t2 at l2_1)
    - After: p1 is in t2, satisfying constraint that p1 must be in t2 after being in a2/t1
15. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2 (t2 drives from l2_1 to l2_2)
    - After: t2 is at l2_2 with p1 inside
16. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (p1 is unloaded from t2 at l2_2)
    - After: p1 is at l2_2, achieving our goal

All constraints are satisfied and the goal is achieved. This is a valid and optimal plan.
