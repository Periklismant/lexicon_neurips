Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. First, I need to understand the initial state, the goal, and the constraints. Let me start by listing everything out.

The goal is to have Package p1 in location l2_2. The initial state says that p1 is in l2_1. So, I need to move p1 from l2_1 to l2_2. But there are constraints to satisfy as well.

Looking at the constraints:

1. At some point, p1 must be in t2 (truck t2).
2. If p1 is in t2, then there must have been a previous state where p1 was either in a2 (airplane) or t1 (truck).
3. At some point, p1 must be in l1_8.
4. At some point, p1 must be in a2.

So, the plan must include moving p1 through these various locations and vehicles to satisfy all constraints.

Let's break down the steps needed.

First, the initial location of p1 is l2_1. The goal is l2_2. Since l2_1 and l2_2 are both in city c2, maybe a truck can move it directly. But wait, the constraints complicate things.

Constraint 3 requires p1 to be in l1_8 at some point. l1_8 is in city c1. So p1 needs to be moved from c2 to c1, then back to c2. How? Since airplanes can move between airports. The airports are l1_1 (c1) and l2_1 (c2). So, perhaps p1 needs to be loaded onto an airplane at l2_1, flown to l1_1, then transported to l1_8 using a truck, then back to c2 via airplane again, and finally delivered to l2_2.

But let's check the initial positions. The airplanes: a1 is in l1_1, and a2 is in l2_1. So a2 is at l2_1, which is where p1 starts. So maybe load p1 into a2, fly a2 to l1_1, unload p1 there, then use a truck in c1 to take it to l1_8. Then, bring it back to l1_1, load onto a1 (but a1 is in l1_1 already?), fly back to l2_1, then use truck t2 (which is in city c2?) to take it to l2_2.

Wait, the initial positions: the problem mentions "Package t1 is in location l1_8". Wait, that's probably a typo because t1 is a truck. Let me check the original state again. The original state says:

"Package t1 is in location l1_8"
"Package t2 is in location l2_1"
"Package p1 is in location l2_1"
"Package a1 is in location l1_1"
"Package a2 is in location l2_1"

Wait, that can't be right. Because t1 and t2 are trucks, not packages. Oh, this must be a mistake in the problem statement. Because in the objects list, there are trucks t1 and t2, airplanes a1 and a2, and packages p1, t1, t2, a1, a2. Wait, no, the objects are:

Wait, the objects list includes:

"package p1"
"truck t1"
"truck t2"
"airplane a1"
"airplane a2"

Then, the original state has:

"Package t1 is in location l1_8"
"Package t2 is in location l2_1"
"Package p1 is in location l2_1"
"Package a1 is in location l1_1"
"Package a2 is in location l2_1"

Wait, that's confusing. So there are packages named t1, t2, a1, a2, and p1. But the trucks and airplanes are separate. So the initial state has package t1 in l1_8, package t2 in l2_1, package p1 in l2_1, package a1 in l1_1, and package a2 in l2_1. But the trucks t1 and t2 and airplanes a1 and a2 are different objects. So, the problem is that the initial state mentions packages with the same names as the trucks and airplanes. That's a bit confusing, but maybe it's intentional.

But the goal is to have "Package p1 is in location l2_2". So p1 starts in l2_1. The constraints involve moving p1 through t2 (which is a truck in c2, since truck t2 is in city c2? Wait, the cities are c1 and c2. The locations in c1 are l1_1 to l1_10, and c2 has l2_1 to l2_10. The initial positions of the trucks and airplanes: the problem says "Package t1 is in location l1_8" which is a package, not the truck. Wait, the original state lists:

"Package t1 is in location l1_8"
"Package t2 is in location l2_1"
"Package p1 is in location l2_1"
"Package a1 is in location l1_1"
"Package a2 is in location l2_1"

So the trucks t1 and t2 are separate from the packages. The trucks' initial positions are not given in the original state. Wait, that's a problem. Because the initial state doesn't mention where the trucks and airplanes are located. The problem statement says "the original state of the world is the following" and lists locations, cities, packages, etc. But where are the trucks and airplanes initially?

Looking back at the problem statement:

The original state includes:

"Location l1_1 is in city c1" etc.

Then:

"Package t1 is in location l1_8"
"Package t2 is in location l2_1"
"Package p1 is in location l2_1"
"Package a1 is in location l1_1"
"Package a2 is in location l2_1"

Wait, but the trucks and airplanes are separate entities. So the initial positions of the trucks t1 and t2 and airplanes a1 and a2 are not specified here. That seems like a critical omission. Without knowing where the trucks and airplanes are initially, it's impossible to plan. For example, if truck t2 is in l2_1 (city c2), then it can be used to move p1 from l2_1 to l2_2 directly. But maybe there's a mistake here.

Wait, the problem says "The original state of the world is the following" and then lists:

"Package t1 is in location l1_8" — this is a package named t1, not the truck t1.

Similarly, "Package a1 is in location l1_1" — a package, not the airplane a1.

But the trucks t1 and t2 and airplanes a1 and a2 are separate objects. The problem statement's original state does not mention where the trucks and airplanes are. This is a problem. Because without knowing where the trucks are initially, how can we plan their movements?

Wait, perhaps the problem statement has a typo, and the lines like "Package t1 is in location l1_8" should actually be "Truck t1 is in location l1_8". Otherwise, the initial state of the trucks and airplanes is unknown, making the problem unsolvable. That must be a mistake. Let me check again.

The problem states:

"The original state of the world is the following:
	"Location l1_1 is in city c1"
	...
	"Package t1 is in location l1_8"
	"Package t2 is in location l2_1"
	"Package p1 is in location l2_1"
	"Package a1 is in location l1_1"
	"Package a2 is in location l2_1""

These are all packages. So the trucks t1 and t2 and airplanes a1 and a2 are not placed anywhere in the initial state. That can't be right. This is a major issue. Because the problem cannot be solved if we don't know where the trucks and airplanes are initially.

Wait, perhaps the problem statement has a formatting error. Maybe the lines like "Package t1 is in location l1_8" are actually supposed to be "Truck t1 is in location l1_8". Let me check the problem statement again.

Looking back at the problem statement:

Under "The original state of the world is the following", it lists:

"Package t1 is in location l1_8"

But in the objects list, there is a "truck t1". So it's possible that the problem statement mistakenly wrote "Package" instead of "Truck" for t1 and t2. Similarly, maybe "Package a1" should be "Airplane a1".

That would make sense. Otherwise, the trucks and airplanes have no initial positions, making the problem unsolvable. Assuming that's a typo, let's proceed under the assumption that the original state entries for t1, t2, a1, a2 are actually the trucks and airplanes, not packages.

So corrected initial state:

- Truck t1 is in l1_8 (city c1)
- Truck t2 is in l2_1 (city c2)
- Package p1 is in l2_1 (city c2)
- Airplane a1 is in l1_1 (city c1)
- Airplane a2 is in l2_1 (city c2)

That makes sense. Now, let's proceed.

So p1 starts in l2_1 (c2). The goal is l2_2 (c2). The constraints are:

1. p1 must be in t2 at some state.
2. If p1 is in t2, there must have been a prior state where p1 was in a2 or t1.
3. p1 must be in l1_8 (c1) at some state.
4. p1 must be in a2 at some state.

So to satisfy constraint 3, p1 must go to l1_8. Since l1_8 is in c1, which is a different city, we need to use an airplane to transport p1 from c2 to c1. Then use a truck in c1 to take it to l1_8, then bring it back.

But how to get it back? Let's outline the steps.

First, p1 is in l2_1 (c2). To get to l1_8 (c1), we need to fly it to c1. So load p1 into airplane a2 (since a2 is initially in l2_1), fly a2 to l1_1 (c1's airport), unload p1 there. Then use truck t1 (which is in l1_8, but wait, the initial corrected state has truck t1 in l1_8. So truck t1 is already in l1_8. Wait, that's a problem. Because to load p1 into t1, t1 needs to be in the same location as p1. So p1 is unloaded at l1_1 (after flying a2 there). Then, to get p1 to l1_8, we need to drive t1 from l1_8 to l1_1, load p1 into t1, then drive back to l1_8. But truck t1 starts in l1_8. So:

1. Drive t1 from l1_8 to l1_1 (c1). Then load p1 into t1. Then drive back to l1_8. Unload p1 there. That would satisfy constraint 3.

Then, to get p1 back to c2, we need to load it onto airplane a1 (which is in l1_1) and fly to l2_1, then unload. Then load into t2 (which is in l2_1) and drive to l2_2.

But let's check the constraints. We need to have p1 in a2 (constraint 4). So when we load p1 into a2 in l2_1, that's one step. Then fly a2 to l1_1. So during that flight, p1 is in a2. So that satisfies constraint 4.

But let's make sure:

Steps:

1. Load p1 into a2 at l2_1 (since a2 is there). Then fly a2 to l1_1. So during the flight, p1 is in a2. When we unload p1 at l1_1, p1 is in l1_1.

But constraint 4 requires p1 to be in a2 at some state, which would be after loading and before unloading. So that's satisfied.

Then, after unloading in l1_1, drive t1 from l1_8 to l1_1 (if possible). Wait, truck t1 is in l1_8. To drive to l1_1, which is in the same city (c1), yes. So:

2. Drive t1 from l1_8 to l1_1.

3. Load p1 into t1 at l1_1.

4. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_8.

5. Unload p1 at l1_8 (satisfies constraint 3).

Then, to get p1 back to c2, we need to get it to an airport. The nearest airport in c1 is l1_1. So:

6. Drive t1 from l1_8 to l1_1.

7. Load p1 into t1 again (wait, no, after step 5, p1 is in l1_8. Then t1 is in l1_8. So after step 5, t1 is in l1_8. So to move p1 to l1_1, we need to load it into t1 again.

Wait, after step 5, p1 is in l1_8 (unloaded from t1). So after step 5, p1 is in l1_8. Then, to move it to l1_1, we need to load it into t1 (which is in l1_8), then drive to l1_1, then unload.

So steps:

5. Unload p1 at l1_8 (now p1 is in l1_8).

6. Load p1 into t1 at l1_8.

7. Drive t1 from l1_8 to l1_1.

8. Unload p1 at l1_1.

Now, p1 is back in l1_1. Then, load into airplane a1 (which is in l1_1).

9. Load p1 into a1 at l1_1.

10. Fly a1 to l2_1 (c2's airport).

11. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1.

Now, p1 is back in l2_1. Then, load into t2 (which is in l2_1).

12. Load p1 into t2 at l2_1 (satisfies constraint 1: p1 is in t2).

But constraint 2 says that if p1 is in t2, there must have been a prior state where p1 was in a2 or t1. Prior states include when p1 was in a2 (step 1-2) and in t1 (steps 3-4, 6-8). So that's satisfied.

Then drive t2 to l2_2.

13. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2.

14. Unload p1 at l2_2, which is the goal.

But let's check the steps:

Total steps would be 14 actions. But maybe there's a shorter path.

Wait, but perhaps some steps can be optimized. For example, after flying a2 to l1_1 with p1, then unload, then drive t1 to l1_1, load, drive to l1_8, unload. Then, to get p1 back to l1_1, drive t1 again, load, drive to l1_1, then load into a1, fly to l2_1, unload, load into t2, drive to l2_2.

But perhaps there's a way to avoid some steps. Let's think.

Alternative approach:

1. Load p1 into a2 at l2_1 (constraint 4 satisfied here).
2. Fly a2 to l1_1.
3. Unload p1 at l1_1.
4. Drive t1 from l1_8 to l1_1 (since t1 starts in l1_8).
5. Load p1 into t1 at l1_1.
6. Drive t1 to l1_8.
7. Unload p1 at l1_8 (constraint 3 satisfied).
8. Now, p1 is in l1_8. To get it back, need to load into t1 again.
9. Drive t1 to l1_1.
10. Load p1 into t1.
11. Drive t1 to l1_1 (wait, no, if t1 is in l1_8, drive to l1_1 again? Wait, after step 6, t1 is in l1_8. Then step 8: drive t1 from l1_8 to l1_1 (step 8). Then load p1 (step 9). Then drive back to l1_1? No, need to drive to l1_1, load, then drive to l1_1? That doesn't make sense. Hmm.

Wait, after step 7, p1 is in l1_8. t1 is in l1_8. So to move p1 back to l1_1, load into t1 (step 8: loadtruck p1 t1 l1_8), then drive t1 to l1_1 (step 9: drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_1 c1), then unload (step 10: unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1). Then load into a1 (step 11: loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1), fly a1 to l2_1 (step 12), unload (step 13), load into t2 (step 14: loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1), drive to l2_2 (step 15), unload (step 16).

That's a lot of steps. But maybe it's necessary to meet all constraints.

But let's check the constraints again:

- p1 in t2 (step 14: when loaded into t2)
- Before that, p1 was in a2 (step 1) and in t1 (steps 5 and 8)
- p1 in l1_8 (step 7)
- p1 in a2 (step 1)

So all constraints are met.

But how to minimize the steps? Let's see:

Alternative path:

After flying a2 to l1_1 (step 2), unload p1 (step 3). Then, t1 is in l1_8. To get p1 to l1_8, drive t1 to l1_1 (step 4), load (step 5), drive back to l1_8 (step 6), unload (step7). Then, to get p1 back to l1_1, load into t1 again (step8), drive to l1_1 (step9), unload (step10). Then load into a1 (step11), fly to l2_1 (step12), unload (step13), load into t2 (step14), drive to l2_2 (step15), unload (step16). That's 16 steps. But maybe some steps can be merged.

Wait, after step7, p1 is in l1_8. To get it back to l1_1, we can load into t1 (still in l1_8), drive to l1_1, unload. So steps 8-10. Then fly back.

But perhaps when p1 is in l1_8, instead of driving back to l1_1, use another truck? But there's only t1 in c1. So no.

Alternatively, after step7, load p1 into t1 (in l1_8), drive to l1_1, unload. Then load into a1, fly to l2_1, unload, load into t2, drive to l2_2. So steps:

1. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
2. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
3. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
4. drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_1 c1
5. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
6. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_8 c1
7. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_8 (constraint3)
8. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_8
9. drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_1 c1
10. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
11. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
12. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
13. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
14. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (constraint1)
15. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
16. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

This is 16 steps. But can we find a shorter path?

Wait, after step3, p1 is in l1_1. Then step4: drive t1 from l1_8 to l1_1. Then step5: load p1 into t1. Then step6: drive back to l1_8, step7: unload. Then step8: load again into t1, step9: drive to l1_1, step10: unload. That's a lot. Is there a way to avoid driving back and forth?

Alternative idea: After step3 (p1 in l1_1), drive t1 to l1_1 (step4), load p1 (step5), drive to l1_8 (step6), unload (step7). Then, since we need to get p1 back to l1_1, can we do that in one step? But after step7, p1 is in l1_8. So we need to load it into t1 again (step8), drive to l1_1 (step9), unload (step10). Then proceed.

Alternatively, after step7 (p1 in l1_8), load into t1 (step8), drive to l1_1 (step9), unload (step10). Then load into a1, fly to l2_1, etc.

Yes, that's necessary. So no way to shorten that.

But perhaps when we fly p1 back, instead of using a1, use a2 again. But a2 is in l1_1 after step2. So after step2, a2 is in l1_1. So to fly back, we can use a2 to fly from l1_1 to l2_1. So steps:

After step7 (p1 in l1_8), steps:

8. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_8
9. drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_1 c1
10. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
11. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (a2 is there)
12. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
13. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
14. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
15. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
16. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

This would save steps by reusing a2 instead of a1. So steps 1-7, then steps 8-16. Let's recount:

1. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
2. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
3. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
4. drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_1 c1
5. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
6. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_8 c1
7. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_8
8. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_8
9. drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_1 c1
10. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
11. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
12. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
13. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
14. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
15. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
16. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

This is still 16 steps. But using a2 to fly back.

But maybe there's a better way. Let's think again.

Wait, after step3 (p1 in l1_1), we can load it into a1 (which is in l1_1) and fly to l2_1. But that skips the need to go to l1_8. But we have to satisfy constraint3 (p1 in l1_8). So no, we have to go to l1_8.

Alternative approach: Instead of flying p1 to l1_1 and then driving to l1_8, perhaps fly directly to l1_8? But airports are only l1_1 and l2_1. So airplanes can only land at airports. So to get to l1_8, which is not an airport, you can't fly there. So must use a truck.

Therefore, the steps are necessary.

So the plan must include:

- Loading p1 into a2 (satisfies constraint4)
- Flying to l1_1
- Using truck t1 to move to l1_8 (satisfies constraint3)
- Then bringing it back to l1_1, flying back to l2_1
- Loading into t2 (satisfies constraint1)
- Driving to l2_2

Now, checking constraints:

- p1 is in t2 (step14)
- Before that, p1 was in a2 (step11) and in t1 (steps5,8)
- p1 is in l1_8 (step7)
- p1 is in a2 (step1 and step11)

So all constraints are met.

But the plan is quite long. Is there a way to make it shorter?

Wait, when p1 is loaded into a2 in step1, flown to l1_1, unloaded. Then, truck t1 drives from l1_8 to l1_1 (step4), loads p1 (step5), drives to l1_8 (step6), unloads (step7). Then, p1 is in l1_8. Now, to get it back, we need to load into t1 again (step8), drive to l1_1 (step9), unload (step10), then load into a2 (step11), fly back (step12), unload (step13), load into t2 (step14), drive (step15), unload (step16).

Alternatively, after step7, can we use another airplane to fly from l1_8? No, because airplanes can only be at airports. So p1 must be moved to an airport (l1_1) to fly back.

So the steps are necessary.

Thus, the minimal plan would be 16 steps. But maybe there's a shorter way.

Wait, step4: drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_1 c1. Then step5: loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1. Then step6: drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_8 c1. step7: unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_8.

After that, step8: loadtruck p1 t1 l1_8. step9: drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_1 c1. step10: unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1.

But could we combine steps4-7 into fewer steps? For example, if after step3 (p1 in l1_1), instead of driving t1 to l1_1, load p1 into a different truck? But there's only t1 in c1. So no.

Alternatively, could we fly p1 directly back after getting it to l1_8? No, because l1_8 is not an airport. So must drive back to l1_1.

So I think the steps are necessary. But perhaps there's a smarter way.

Wait, maybe after step7, p1 is in l1_8. Then, we need to get it back to l2_1. But instead of driving back to l1_1 and flying, could we use another airplane? But a1 is already in l1_1. So to use a1, we have to be at l1_1.

Alternatively, after step7, load p1 into t1, drive to l1_1, then load into a1, fly to l2_1. That would save steps compared to using a2 again.

So steps:

After step7:

8. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_8
9. drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_1 c1
10. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
11. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
12. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
13. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
14. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
15. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
16. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

This way, steps 11-12 use a1 instead of a2. But a1 is in l1_1 initially, so it's available. This plan is still 16 steps. Doesn't save steps.

Alternatively, after step7, maybe use a different airplane, but there's only a1 and a2. a2 is in l1_1 after step2. So we can use a2 to fly back.

But the steps remain the same.

So perhaps the minimal plan is indeed 16 steps. But maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, let's think again. The initial state:

- p1 is in l2_1 (c2)
- a2 is in l2_1 (airport)
- t2 is in l2_1 (assuming the corrected state)

Wait, if truck t2 is in l2_1 initially, then to move p1 to l2_2, it's just drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2 and unload. But the constraints require p1 to go through l1_8 and a2.

So the problem requires that even though the direct route is possible, the constraints force a longer path.

But the problem says to provide an optimal plan, i.e., the shortest possible.

But given the constraints, the plan must include those detours. So the minimal plan must include the necessary steps to satisfy all constraints.

But maybe there's a shorter path. Let's think differently.

Alternative plan:

1. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 → but wait, t2 is in l2_1 (if the corrected initial state). But constraint2 says that if p1 is in t2, it must have been in a2 or t1 before. So we can't load into t2 directly because initially p1 hasn't been in a2 or t1 yet.

So the first time p1 is in t2 must be after being in a2 or t1.

So first, p1 must be loaded into a2 or t1 before being in t2.

Therefore, the steps must first move p1 into a2 or t1, then into t2.

So the plan must involve moving p1 from l2_1 to a2 or t1, then to t2.

But t1 is in c1 (l1_8), so how to get p1 into t1? It has to be moved to c1 first.

Thus, the initial steps must involve moving p1 to c1 via a2.

So the plan outline is:

- Load p1 into a2 (satisfies constraint4)
- Fly a2 to l1_1
- Unload p1 in l1_1
- Drive t1 to l1_1
- Load p1 into t1 (satisfies prior state for constraint2)
- Drive t1 to l1_8 and unload (satisfies constraint3)
- Then, move p1 back to c2 via a1 or a2
- Load into t2 and drive to l2_2

But how to get p1 back to c2.

So steps:

1. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
2. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
3. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
4. drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_1 c1
5. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
6. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_8 c1
7. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_8 (constraint3)
8. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_8
9. drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_1 c1
10. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
11. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
12. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
13. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
14. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (constraint1, with prior state in a1)
15. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
16. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

This is 16 steps. The only difference is using a1 instead of a2 for the return flight.

But maybe there's a way to use a2 for the return flight, which is already at l1_1.

So steps:

After step7:

8. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_8
9. drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_1 c1
10. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
11. loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
12. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
13. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
14. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
15. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
16. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

This is also 16 steps, same as before.

But is there a way to reduce the steps? Let's see.

Wait, after step3 (p1 in l1_1), truck t1 is in l1_8. So we have to drive t1 to l1_1 to load p1. Then drive back to l1_8 to unload. Then drive back to l1_1 again. This is three drives for t1: l1_8 → l1_1 → l1_8 → l1_1.

But perhaps there's a way to avoid one of these drives.

For example:

After step3 (p1 in l1_1), drive t1 from l1_8 to l1_1 (step4), load p1 (step5), drive to l1_8 (step6), unload (step7). Now p1 is in l1_8 (constraint3 met). Then, to get p1 back to l1_1, load into t1 (step8), drive to l1_1 (step9), unload (step10). Then fly back.

So steps4-10 are necessary. So no way to shorten that.

Therefore, the plan requires 16 steps. However, perhaps there's a smarter way.

Another idea: When p1 is in l1_8 (step7), can we fly it directly from l1_8 to l2_1? No, because airplanes can only fly between airports. l1_8 is not an airport.

Thus, the plan must be as outlined.

Now, let's check if all constraints are met:

- p1 is in t2 (step14)
- Before that, p1 was in a2 (steps1-3) and in t1 (steps5-7,8-10)
- p1 is in l1_8 (step7)
- p1 is in a2 (steps1-3)

All constraints are satisfied.

So the final plan would have 16 actions. But perhaps there's a shorter plan.

Wait, what if after step7 (p1 in l1_8), instead of driving back to l1_1, we use another truck? But there's only t1 in c1. So no.

Alternative approach: Can we satisfy the constraints without moving p1 all the way back to c2 via airplane? For example, after getting p1 to l1_8, can we load it into a different airplane and fly to l2_1? But airplanes can only be at airports. So p1 has to be moved back to l1_1 (an airport) to fly.

Thus, the steps are necessary.

Therefore, the optimal plan is the 16-step plan outlined earlier.
