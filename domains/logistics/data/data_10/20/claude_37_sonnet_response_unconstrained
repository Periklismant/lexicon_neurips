Let me analyze this problem step by step.

First, let's clarify the objects and their initial states:

**Locations**:
- In city c1: l1_1 (airport), l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5, l1_6, l1_7, l1_8
- In city c2: l2_1 (airport), l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5, l2_6, l2_7, l2_8

**Packages**:
- p1 is in location l2_6 (in city c2)
- p2 is in location l1_2 (in city c1)

**Trucks**:
- t1 is in location l1_2 (in city c1)
- t2 is in location l2_1 (in city c2)

**Airplanes**:
- a1 is in location l1_1 (airport in city c1)
- a2 is in location l2_1 (airport in city c2)

The goal is to have:
- p1 in location l2_8 (in city c2)
- p2 in location l1_2 (in city c1) - which is already satisfied

So I need to plan how to move p1 from l2_6 to l2_8.

Wait, I notice there's an inconsistency in the initial state description. It says "Package t1 is in location l1_2" and "Package t2 is in location l2_1" - but t1 and t2 are trucks, not packages. Let me assume this is a typo and that the trucks are in these locations.

So I'll assume:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_2 (in city c1)
- Truck t2 is in location l2_1 (in city c2)

Given this, let's plan how to move p1 from l2_6 to l2_8:

1. Drive truck t2 from airport l2_1 to location l2_6 to pick up package p1
2. Load package p1 into truck t2 at location l2_6
3. Drive truck t2 from location l2_6 to location l2_8
4. Unload package p1 from truck t2 at location l2_8

This should satisfy the goal. Let me write out the plan in the required format:

```
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_6 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_6
drivetruck t2 l2_6 l2_8 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_8
```

Actually, let me check the constraints again. The problem statement says "A valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints:" but no constraints are listed. So I'll assume there are no additional constraints.

Let me verify that this plan meets all the action preconditions:

1. "drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_6 c2": 
   - t2 is situated in l2_1 ✓
   - l2_1 and l2_6 are both locations in city c2 ✓

2. "loadtruck p1 t2 l2_6":
   - p1 and t2 are both in location l2_6 ✓ (after the previous action)

3. "drivetruck t2 l2_6 l2_8 c2":
   - t2 is situated in l2_6 ✓ (after the previous actions)
   - l2_6 and l2_8 are both locations in city c2 ✓

4. "unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_8":
   - t2 is situated in l2_8 ✓ (after the previous actions)
   - p1 is in t2 ✓ (after the previous actions)

The plan satisfies all preconditions and achieves the goal. Since p2 is already in location l1_2, we don't need to do anything with it.

Now, to check if this is an optimal plan, I need to see if there's any shorter valid plan. Since we need to move p1 from l2_6 to l2_8, and that requires:
1. Getting a truck to l2_6
2. Loading p1 into the truck
3. Moving the truck to l2_8
4. Unloading p1 at l2_8

These are the minimum necessary steps, so this plan is optimal.

The final optimal plan is:
```
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_6 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_6
drivetruck t2 l2_6 l2_8 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_8
```

Actually, I need to double-check the initial state again. I realized there might be more inconsistencies. Let me review the initial state:

"Package t1 is in location l1_2" - This seems wrong, t1 is a truck.
"Package t2 is in location l2_1" - This seems wrong, t2 is a truck.
"Package p1 is in location l2_6" - This seems correct.
"Package p2 is in location l1_2" - This seems correct.
"Package a1 is in location l1_1" - This seems wrong, a1 is an airplane.
"Package a2 is in location l2_1" - This seems wrong, a2 is an airplane.

I believe the correct initial state should be:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_2
- Truck t2 is in location l2_1
- Package p1 is in location l2_6
- Package p2 is in location l1_2
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

With this understanding, the plan I've developed remains valid.

Let me check if there's a way to use airplanes to make the plan more efficient. Since p1 is in l2_6 and needs to go to l2_8, both of which are in city c2, it's more efficient to use a truck for this local move rather than involving an airplane. So the optimal plan remains as I stated above.

Confirming my answer:
```
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_6 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_6
drivetruck t2 l2_6 l2_8 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_8
```

Ah, I need to address one more detail. The plan I provided has the action "loadtruck p1 t2 l2_6", and the action description in the problem is: "loadtruck p t l": Load package p in truck t. Both p and t are in location l.

So the precondition checks out: both p1 and t2 are in location l2_6 when this action is performed.

After the action, the effects are:
1. p1 is no longer situated in l2_6 (it's in t2 now)
2. p1 is in t2

This aligns with the effects described for the loadtruck action in the problem statement: "(i) p is no longer situated in l, and (ii) p is in t."

I also notice a typo in the problem statement where "unloadairplane" is mislabeled as "loadairplane" for the second time it appears. But based on context, I understand it's meant to be "unloadairplane".

I'm confident in the plan I've provided, but I'll double-check one more time:

1. "drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_6 c2":
   - Precondition: t2 is in l2_1, and both l2_1 and l2_6 are in city c2 ✓
   - Effect: t2 moves from l2_1 to l2_6 ✓

2. "loadtruck p1 t2 l2_6":
   - Precondition: Both p1 and t2 are in location l2_6 ✓
   - Effect: p1 is loaded into t2 ✓

3. "drivetruck t2 l2_6 l2_8 c2":
   - Precondition: t2 is in l2_6, and both l2_6 and l2_8 are in city c2 ✓
   - Effect: t2 moves from l2_6 to l2_8 ✓

4. "unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_8":
   - Precondition: t2 is in l2_8 and p1 is in t2 ✓
   - Effect: p1 is unloaded from t2 into l2_8 ✓

This satisfies the goal of having p1 in location l2_8. Since p2 is already in location l1_2, the entire goal is met.

Checking for optimality: This plan uses the most direct route to move p1 from l2_6 to l2_8, so it seems optimal. No unnecessary actions or detours.

So, the optimal plan is:
```
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_6 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_6
drivetruck t2 l2_6 l2_8 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_8
```
