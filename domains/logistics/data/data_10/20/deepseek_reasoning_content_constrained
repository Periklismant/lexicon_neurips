Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. Hmm, the goal is to get p1 to l2_8 and p2 to stay in l1_2. Wait, but p2 is already in l1_2 initially, right? So maybe the main challenge is moving p1. But there are a bunch of constraints we need to satisfy. Let's list out all the constraints first to make sure I don't miss any.

The constraints are:

1. At some state, p1 is in l2_6. And if that's true, then p1 must be in l1_8 at s or after.
2. At some state, p1 is in t2. If so, then either p2 is in l1_8 or p1 is in l2_5 at or after s.
3. At some state, p2 is in l1_7.
4. At some state, p2 is in t2.
5. At some state, p1 is in t1 or a1.
6. At some state, p1 is in l2_4.
7. At some state, p2 is in l1_1.
8. At some state, p1 is in a2.
9. At some state, p2 is in a1.

Wow, that's a lot. Let's start with the main goal: getting p1 from l2_6 to l2_8. Since l2_6 is in city c2, maybe we can use a truck in c2. But the initial locations: t1 is in l1_2 (c1), t2 is in l2_1 (c2). So t2 is in c2. So perhaps we can use t2 to move p1 within c2.

But p1 starts in l2_6. To move it via truck, we need to load it into t2. But t2 is initially at l2_1. So first, drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_6. Then load p1 into t2, drive to l2_8, and unload. But wait, the problem is that l2_8 is a location in c2. So that's possible. But what about the constraints?

Let's check the constraints. Let's see:

- We need p1 to be in l2_6 at some state. But initially, p1 is already in l2_6. So that condition is satisfied at the initial state. But then, the constraint says that if p1 is in l2_6 in some state s, then in s or after, p1 must be in l1_8. Wait, but l1_8 is in city c1. So how can p1 get to l1_8? That's in another city. So maybe we have to move p1 to c1 first. But that complicates things because the main goal is to have p1 in l2_8. Hmm. Wait, but the constraint is conditional. If p1 is ever in l2_6, then after that, it needs to be in l1_8 at some point. But since the initial state has p1 in l2_6, that's a problem. Because the initial state already has p1 in l2_6, so according to the constraint, in the initial state s0, since p1 is in l2_6, then in s0 or after, p1 must be in l1_8. But the final goal is for p1 to be in l2_8, which is in c2. So we have to first move p1 to l1_8 in c1, then somehow get it back to c2. But that seems inefficient. Wait, but maybe the initial state's p1 being in l2_6 is already triggering the first constraint. So we have to make sure that after the initial state, p1 is moved to l1_8 at some point. But the main goal is to have p1 in l2_8. So perhaps the plan involves moving p1 from l2_6 to c1 via airplane, then back to c2. Let's see.

But first, let's note that the initial state has:

- p1 at l2_6 (c2)
- p2 at l1_2 (c1)
- t1 at l1_2 (c1)
- t2 at l2_1 (c2)
- a1 at l1_1 (c1's airport)
- a2 at l2_1 (c2's airport)

So to move p1 from c2 to c1, we need to use airplanes. For example, load p1 into a2 (which is at l2_1), fly a2 to l1_1 (c1's airport), then unload p1 there. Then use a truck in c1 to move it to l1_8.

But the main goal is to have p1 in l2_8, which is in c2. So moving p1 to c1 would require moving it back. That seems like a lot of steps, but maybe necessary to satisfy the constraints.

But let's check the constraints again. The first constraint says that if p1 is in l2_6 (which it is initially), then p1 must be in l1_8 at s or after. So the initial state already triggers this, so we have to ensure that at some point after the initial state, p1 is in l1_8. So even if we immediately move p1 from l2_6, we still have to have it reach l1_8. Wait, but the constraint is that if in any state s, p1 is in l2_6, then in s or after, p1 must be in l1_8. So since in the initial state, p1 is in l2_6, we need to have p1 in l1_8 at some point after the initial state. So even if we move p1 out of l2_6 in the first step, we still have to make sure that p1 ends up in l1_8 at some point.

But the final goal is for p1 to be in l2_8. So the plan must include moving p1 from l2_6 to l1_8, then somehow back to c2, then to l2_8. But that's a long path. Let's think about how to do that.

Alternatively, maybe the initial state counts as the state where p1 is in l2_6, so the constraint requires that p1 must be in l1_8 at some point after that. So even if p1 is moved from l2_6, the constraint is still satisfied as long as it's moved to l1_8 later. So the plan needs to include moving p1 to l1_8, then moving it back to c2.

But how to do that? Let's outline possible steps:

1. Move p1 from l2_6 to l2_1 (airport) via truck t2. Then load into a2, fly to l1_1 (c1's airport), unload, load into truck t1, drive to l1_8, unload (satisfies the constraint that p1 is in l1_8). Then load back into a1, fly to l2_1, unload into t2, drive to l2_8, unload. But this would be a long plan. Also, need to satisfy other constraints.

But let's check other constraints. For example, we have to have p2 in l1_7 at some point. p2 starts in l1_2. So use t1 to drive to l1_7 and unload. Then maybe reload and bring back to l1_2. But the final goal requires p2 to be in l1_2, which it already is. Wait, no: the original state says "Package p2 is in location l1_2", and the goal is "Package p2 is in location l1_2". So p2 is already there. So the constraints that require moving p2 to l1_7, l1_1, t2, a1, etc., must be satisfied during the plan, but then p2 must end up back in l1_2. So that's tricky. Because if we move p2 away from l1_2, we need to bring it back.

Wait, but the goal is to have p2 in l1_2. So p2 must start there and maybe be moved and then returned. For example:

- Load p2 into t1 (which is in l1_2), drive t1 to l1_7, unload p2 (so p2 is in l1_7, satisfying that constraint). Then load p2 again, drive back to l1_2, unload. That would take care of the "p2 in l1_7" constraint, and return it to the original location.

Similarly, for the constraint that p2 is in t2: but t2 is in c2. How can p2 get into t2? Since p2 is in c1, t2 is in c2. So to get p2 into t2, we need to move p2 to c2. That would require using airplanes. For example, load p2 into a1 (at l1_1), fly to l2_1, unload into t2. Then load into t2, drive somewhere, unload, then maybe fly back. But this would complicate things, but it's necessary to satisfy the constraint that p2 is in t2 at some state.

Similarly, p2 must be in a1 at some state. So load p2 into a1 (which is in l1_1), then maybe unload again.

So considering all these constraints, the plan must involve moving both p1 and p2 through various locations and vehicles.

But the main problem is p1's constraints. Let's outline the steps for p1:

Initial state: p1 in l2_6 (c2)

Constraints:

- Must be in l2_6 at some state (already true initially)
- If in l2_6, then must be in l1_8 at or after. So we need to move p1 to l1_8.
- Must be in t2 at some state. So p1 must be loaded into t2.
- When p1 is in t2, then either p2 is in l1_8 or p1 is in l2_5 at or after. Since p1's final goal is l2_8, l2_5 is in c2. So maybe when p1 is in t2, we can drive to l2_5 first, then to l2_8. That would satisfy the condition.
- Must be in l2_4 at some state. So p1 has to be in l2_4.
- Must be in a2 at some state. So p1 has to be loaded into a2.
- Also, the condition that in some state, p1 is in t1 or a1. Since t1 is in c1 and a1 is in c1, this requires moving p1 to c1.

So the plan for p1 would involve:

1. From l2_6, load into t2 (but t2 is in l2_1, so first drive t2 to l2_6. So drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_6. Then load p1 into t2. Now p1 is in t2. This satisfies the constraint that p1 is in t2. Now, when this happens, the constraint requires that either p2 is in l1_8 or p1 is in l2_5 at or after this state. Since we need to satisfy that, perhaps after loading p1 into t2, drive t2 to l2_5. Then unload p1 in l2_5 (so p1 is in l2_5, satisfying the condition). Then load again into t2, drive to l2_8, unload. But then also need to move p1 to l1_8. Hmm, but this might not be compatible.

Alternatively, after loading p1 into t2 (state s), we drive t2 to l2_5, so in the next state, p1 is in l2_5. That would satisfy the constraint (since after s, p1 is in l2_5). But then, how to get p1 to l1_8.

Wait, but we have to get p1 to l1_8 to satisfy the first constraint. So maybe after moving p1 to l2_5, then we need to fly it to c1.

So steps for p1:

- Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_6: drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_6 c2
- Load p1 into t2: loadtruck p1 t2 l2_6 (now p1 is in t2, satisfying the constraint. At this state s, we need to ensure that either p2 is in l1_8 or p1 is in l2_5 after s. So after this, perhaps drive t2 to l2_5: drivetruck t2 l2_6 l2_5 c2. Then unload p1: unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5. Now p1 is in l2_5, which satisfies the condition. Then load p1 back into t2, drive to l2_4: drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2, unload (so p1 is in l2_4, satisfying another constraint). Then load into t2 again, drive to l2_1 (airport), load into a2, fly to l1_1, unload, load into t1, drive to l1_8, unload (now p1 is in l1_8, satisfying the first constraint). Then load into a1, fly back to l2_1, load into t2, drive to l2_8. That's a lot, but let's see.

But also, we have to satisfy the constraint that p1 is in a2. So during this process, when we load p1 into a2 (when flying to c1), that's satisfied.

But this seems very long. Let's check if there's a shorter path.

Alternatively, maybe after moving p1 to l1_8, we can fly it back to c2 and then to l2_8.

But let's also consider the constraints for p2. For example, p2 must be in l1_7, l1_1, t2, a1.

So steps for p2:

p2 starts in l1_2. Need to get it to l1_7 (using t1), l1_1 (using a1), into t2 (which is in c2, so need to fly to c2), into a1.

But since the final goal is p2 in l1_2, we have to bring it back.

Let's try to outline the plan step by step, integrating all constraints.

First, handle the constraint that p1 must be in l1_8 after being in l2_6. So:

1. Move p1 from l2_6 to l2_1 via t2:

   a. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_6: drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_6 c2
   b. Load p1 into t2: loadtruck p1 t2 l2_6 (now p1 is in t2, satisfying constraint)
   c. Now, because p1 is in t2 (state s), we need to ensure that either p2 is in l1_8 or p1 is in l2_5 at or after s. Let's choose to have p1 in l2_5.
   d. Drive t2 from l2_6 to l2_5: drivetruck t2 l2_6 l2_5 c2
   e. Unload p1: unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (now p1 is in l2_5, satisfying the condition)
   f. Now, to get p1 to l2_4: drive t2 to l2_4, load p1, unload there.
   g. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_4: drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2
   h. Load p1: loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5? Wait, no, after unloading in l2_5, p1 is in l2_5. So to get to l2_4, we need to load into t2 again. But t2 is in l2_5 after step d. So:

   e. After unloading p1 in l2_5, drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_4: drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2
   f. Then load p1 into t2: but p1 is in l2_5, and t2 is in l2_4. Can't load. Oops, that's a problem. So maybe after unloading in l2_5, we need to have t2 stay there. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps after unloading in l2_5, p1 is in l2_5. Then, to get it to l2_4, we need another truck? But t2 is the only truck in c2. So we have to use t2 again. So:

   e. Unload p1 in l2_5 (p1 is there)
   f. Drive t2 back to l2_5 to l2_4 (but t2 is already in l2_5 after step d). Wait, step d was driving to l2_5, then step e is unload. Then t2 is in l2_5. So drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_4: drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2. Then load p1 into t2 (but p1 is in l2_5, t2 is in l2_4. Can't load. So that's impossible.

Hmm, so maybe we need to adjust the steps. Perhaps after loading p1 into t2 in l2_6, drive t2 to l2_5, unload (so p1 is in l2_5), then drive t2 to l2_4 (empty), but that doesn't help. Alternatively, after unloading p1 in l2_5, we need to move p1 to l2_4 another way. But how? Maybe use airplane. But l2_5 is not an airport. So that's not possible. So perhaps the only way is to have p1 in l2_4 while in t2. Wait, the constraint is that p1 must be in l2_4 at some state. So maybe after loading p1 into t2, drive to l2_4, then unload. Let's try:

1. Drive t2 to l2_6: drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_6 c2
2. Load p1 into t2: loadtruck p1 t2 l2_6 (p1 in t2, satisfying constraint)
3. Drive t2 to l2_4: drivetruck t2 l2_6 l2_4 c2 (so now p1 is in t2 at l2_4)
4. Unload p1 in l2_4: unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (now p1 is in l2_4, satisfying constraint)
5. Now, drive t2 to l2_5: drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2 (empty)
6. Then load p1 into t2 again? But p1 is in l2_4, and t2 is in l2_5. Can't. So maybe this approach isn't working.

Alternatively, after loading p1 into t2 in l2_6, drive to l2_4, unload (satisfies l2_4 constraint). Then, since p1 is in l2_4, we need to move it to l1_8. But l1_8 is in c1, so we need to fly. So from l2_4, drive t2 to l2_1 (airport), load into a2, fly to l1_1, unload, then load into t1, drive to l1_8.

But also, we have the constraint that p1 must be in a2. So when we load into a2, that's satisfied.

So steps for p1:

1. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_6: drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_6 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_6 (now p1 in t2, satisfies "p1 in t2" constraint)
   - At this state s, the constraint requires that after s, either p2 is in l1_8 or p1 is in l2_5. Let's choose p1 in l2_5 later.
3. Drive t2 to l2_4: drivetruck t2 l2_6 l2_4 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (now p1 in l2_4, satisfies that constraint)
5. Drive t2 back to l2_5: drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2 (empty)
6. Now, load p1 into t2 again. Wait, p1 is in l2_4, t2 is in l2_5. Can't. So this approach isn't working.

Alternative approach: After step 2 (p1 in t2), drive t2 to l2_5.

3. drivetruck t2 l2_6 l2_5 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (now p1 is in l2_5, which satisfies the conditional after step 2)
5. Now, to get p1 to l2_4: need to move it from l2_5. But how? Maybe drive t2 back to l2_5, load p1, drive to l2_4. Wait, but after step 4, p1 is in l2_5, t2 is in l2_5. So:

5. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (possible since both are there)
6. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2
7. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (now p1 is in l2_4)
   - Satisfies the constraint for l2_4.
8. Now, to get p1 to l1_8. So need to move to airport l2_1.

9. drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1: drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
10. load p1 into a2: loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (now p1 is in a2, satisfies that constraint)
11. fly a2 to l1_1: flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
12. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (now p1 is in l1_1)
13. load p1 into t1 (which is in l1_2 initially. Wait, t1 is in l1_2. So need to move t1 to l1_1.

14. drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1: drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
15. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (but p1 is in l1_1, t1 is there)
16. drive t1 to l1_8: drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_8 c1
17. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_8 (now p1 is in l1_8, satisfying the first constraint)
18. Now, need to get p1 back to c2's l2_8. So load into a1 (at l1_1)
19. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (a1 is in l1_1)
20. fly a1 to l2_1: flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
21. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 (now p1 is in l2_1)
22. load into t2: loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
23. drive t2 to l2_8: drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_8 c2
24. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_8 (done for p1's goal)

But this plan has a lot of steps. Let's see if we can optimize.

But also, during this process, we need to handle p2's constraints.

p2's constraints:

- Must be in l1_7
- Must be in t2
- Must be in a1
- Must be in l1_1
- Also, the constraint that when p1 is in t2, then after that, either p2 is in l1_8 or p1 is in l2_5. We already handled that by moving p1 to l2_5.

But for p2:

p2 starts in l1_2. To get to l1_7:

- Use t1 to drive from l1_2 to l1_7, unload p2.

But since p2 is initially in l1_2, and we need to move it to l1_7, then back.

Also, to get p2 into t2 (which is in c2), we need to fly p2 to c2. So:

For p2:

- Load p2 into a1 (at l1_1, but initially a1 is in l1_1. Wait, initial state says "Package a1 is in location l1_1". Wait, but a1 is an airplane, not a package. Wait, the original state description says:

"Package a1 is in location l1_1"

Wait, no, that's a mistake. The objects include "airplane a1" and "airplane a2". So the original state probably has "Airplane a1 is in location l1_1", not Package a1. But the user wrote:

The original state of the world is the following:

	"Location l1_1 is in city c1"
	...
	"Package t1 is in location l1_2"
	"Package t2 is in location l2_1"
	"Package p1 is in location l2_6"
	"Package p2 is in location l1_2"
	"Package a1 is in location l1_1"
	"Package a2 is in location l2_1"

Wait, that's a problem. Because a1 and a2 are airplanes, not packages. So this must be a typo. The user probably meant "Airplane a1 is in location l1_1", but they wrote "Package a1...". Similarly for a2. This is a critical error. Because if a1 is a package, then we can't fly it. But according to the problem statement, airplanes can fly. So this must be a mistake in the initial state description. Assuming that it's a typo, and the correct initial state has airplanes a1 and a2 in their respective airports.

Assuming that, the original state should be:

"Airplane a1 is in location l1_1"

"Airplane a2 is in location l2_1"

So I'll proceed with that assumption. Otherwise, the problem is impossible because airplanes can't be moved if they are packages.

So with that in mind, let's correct the initial state:

- Airplane a1 is at l1_1 (c1's airport)
- Airplane a2 is at l2_1 (c2's airport)
- Trucks t1 is at l1_2 (c1)
- Truck t2 is at l2_1 (c2)
- Package p1 is at l2_6 (c2)
- Package p2 is at l1_2 (c1)

Now, back to p2's constraints.

To get p2 into t2 (which is in c2), we need to move p2 to c2. So steps:

- Load p2 into t1 (which is in l1_2), drive to l1_1 (airport), load into a1, fly to l2_1, unload into t2, then drive somewhere.

But we have to return p2 to l1_2 at the end. So:

For p2:

1. Load p2 into t1: loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
2. Drive t1 to l1_1: drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
3. Unload p2: unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (now p2 is in l1_1, satisfying the constraint that p2 is in l1_1)
4. Load p2 into a1: loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (now p2 is in a1, satisfying that constraint)
5. Fly a1 to l2_1: flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
6. Unload p2: unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (now p2 is in l2_1)
7. Load p2 into t2: loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (satisfies p2 in t2)
8. Now, drive t2 to l2_5 (to satisfy the condition when p1 was in t2, but we need to check if that's needed. Alternatively, after p2 is loaded into t2, drive to l2_5, unload, but how does that help? Not sure. But the constraint is that when p1 is in t2 (step 2 in p1's plan), then after that, either p2 is in l1_8 or p1 is in l2_5. Since in p1's plan we had p1 in l2_5 later, that would satisfy it. But during the time when p2 is in t2, perhaps driving to l2_5 isn't necessary.

But let's integrate all steps.

Now, combining both p1 and p2's steps:

The plan would have interleaved actions for both packages.

But to manage this, perhaps we can first handle p2's movement to satisfy its constraints, then focus on p1.

But this could get very complicated. Let's try to outline a possible plan step by step.

Step 1: Move p2 from l1_2 to l1_7 using t1.

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
2. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_7 c1
3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_7 (now p2 is in l1_7, satisfying constraint)
4. drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_2 c1 (drive back)
5. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (p2 is back)

But wait, the final goal requires p2 to be in l1_2, which is already satisfied. So steps 1-5 handle p2's constraint to be in l1_7.

But also, p2 needs to be in l1_1, a1, and t2.

So steps 6-... for p2:

6. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
7. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
8. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (p2 in l1_1, constraint satisfied)
9. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (p2 in a1, constraint satisfied)
10. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (move to c2)
11. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (p2 in l2_1)
12. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (p2 in t2, constraint satisfied)
13. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2 (drive to l2_5)
14. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 (p2 in l2_5)
15. Now, need to return p2 to l1_2. So load into a2, fly back to l1_1, then truck.

But this is getting very long. Maybe we can interleave steps for p1 and p2.

But this is getting too complicated. Let's try to find the shortest possible plan that satisfies all constraints.

Alternative approach:

For p1's movement:

- From l2_6, drive t2 to l2_6, load, drive to l2_8. But can't because of constraints.

Wait, but the first constraint requires that if p1 is ever in l2_6, then it must later be in l1_8. Since p1 starts in l2_6, the initial state already triggers this, so we have to move p1 to l1_8. So regardless of other steps, p1 must go to l1_8.

So the minimal plan must involve moving p1 to l1_8 and back to l2_8.

For p1:

1. Drive t2 to l2_6: drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_6 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_6 (now p1 in t2)
   - Now, the constraint that when p1 is in t2, either p2 in l1_8 or p1 in l2_5. So after this, ensure p1 goes to l2_5.
3. drivetruck t2 l2_6 l2_5 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (now p1 in l2_5)
5. Now, drive t2 to l2_1: drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
6. load p1 into a2: loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (now in a2)
7. fly a2 to l1_1
8. unload p1: unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
9. load into t1: need to drive t1 to l1_1. So drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1: drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
10. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
11. drive to l1_8: drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_8 c1
12. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_8 (p1 in l1_8, satisfying first constraint)
13. Now, get p1 back to c2:
14. drive t1 back to l1_1
15. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (assuming a1 is at l1_1)
16. fly a1 to l2_1
17. unload p1: unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
18. load into t2: loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
19. drive to l2_8: drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_8 c2
20. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_8 (done)

For p2's constraints:

- Need to be in l1_7, l1_1, t2, a1.

Let's handle these during p1's plan.

For example:

While t1 is moving to l1_1 (step 9 for p1), we can load p2 into t1 initially:

But p2 starts in l1_2. So:

At step 9: drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 (to get to l1_1 for p1). So before that, load p2 into t1:

0. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
1. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 (this is step 9 in p1's plan)
2. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (now p2 is in l1_1)
   - Satisfies the constraint p2 in l1_1
3. Then, load p2 into a1: loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (satisfies p2 in a1)
4. fly a1 to l2_1 (step 16 in p1's plan)
5. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (now p2 is in l2_1)
6. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (when t2 is back at l2_1 after step 5 in p1's plan)
   - Now p2 is in t2, satisfying that constraint
7. drive t2 to l2_5 (step 3 in p1's plan)
   - But t2 is carrying p2 and p1? No, because p1 was unloaded at l2_5. So maybe after step 4 in p1's plan (unload p1 at l2_5), t2 is empty. Then when t2 returns to l2_1 (step 5), it can carry p2.

Wait, let's integrate:

In p1's plan:

Step 1-4: p1 is moved to l2_5.

Step 5: drive t2 back to l2_1.

At step 5, t2 is in l2_1. At this point, p2 can be loaded into t2.

So during p1's step 5 (drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2), after that:

6. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (p2 is now in t2, satisfying the constraint)
7. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_8 c2 (carrying p2)
8. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_8 (but final goal requires p2 to be in l1_2. So we need to move p2 back.)

But this complicates things. Alternatively, after loading p2 into t2, drive to l2_5, unload, then fly back to c1.

But this is getting too involved. Given the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to outline a plan that covers all the necessary steps, even if it's lengthy.

Final Plan Outline:

1. Move p2 to l1_7 using t1.
2. Return p2 to l1_2.
3. Move p2 to l1_1, load into a1, fly to c2, unload into t2.
4. Move p1 through t2 to l2_5, then to l2_4.
5. Fly p1 to c1, move to l1_8.
6. Fly p1 back to c2, then to l2_8.
7. Return p2 to l1_2.

But each of these steps must be written in actions.

Considering the complexity and the need to satisfy all constraints, here's a possible plan:

```
```
drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_7 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_7
drivetruck t1 l1_7 l1_2 c1
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_6 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_6
drivetruck t2 l2_6 l2_5 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_8 c1
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_8
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_8
drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_1 c1
loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_8 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_8
drivetruck t2 l2_8 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
```
```

But I'm not sure if this covers all constraints. For example, p1 must be in a2: when we load p1 into a2 in step 14, that's covered. p2 in a1: step 4. p1 in l2_4: step 11-12. p1 in t1: step 17. p2 in t2: step 9. p1 in l2_6: initially, but the first constraint requires that after being there, it must go to l1_8, which it does. Also, when p1 is in t2 (step 7), the condition requires that after that, either p2 is in l1_8 or p1 in l2_5. Since p1 is later in l2_5 (step 10), that satisfies it. 

This plan seems to cover all the constraints, but it's very long. Maybe there's a shorter path. But given the complexity of the constraints, especially the ones requiring multiple intermediate states, this might be the optimal plan.
