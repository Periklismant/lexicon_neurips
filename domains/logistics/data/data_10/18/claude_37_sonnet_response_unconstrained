Let me analyze this problem step by step:

First, let's clarify what objects we have:
- Locations: l1_1 (airport in city c1), l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5, l2_1 (airport in city c2), l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5
- Cities: c1, c2
- Packages: p1, p2
- Trucks: t1, t2
- Airplanes: a1, a2

Starting state:
- Location l1_1 is in city c1 (airport)
- Locations l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5 are in city c1
- Location l2_1 is in city c2 (airport)
- Locations l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5 are in city c2
- Truck t1 is in location l1_3
- Truck t2 is in location l2_1
- Package p1 is in location l2_4
- Package p2 is in location l2_4
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (airport in c1)
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1 (airport in c2)

Goal:
- Package p1 is in location l2_1 (airport in c2)
- Package p2 is in location l1_3 (in city c1)

I see some issues with the initial state. The problem says:
- "Package t1 is in location l1_3"
- "Package t2 is in location l2_1"
- "Package a1 is in location l1_1"
- "Package a2 is in location l2_1"

But t1 and t2 are trucks, and a1 and a2 are airplanes, not packages. Let's assume what was meant was:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_3
- Truck t2 is in location l2_1
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

Let me plan how to achieve the goal:

1. For p1 (currently in l2_4, need to move to l2_1):
   - Use truck t2 to transport p1 from l2_4 to l2_1
   
2. For p2 (currently in l2_4, need to move to l1_3):
   - Use truck t2 to transport p2 from l2_4 to l2_1 (airport)
   - Use airplane a2 to transport p2 from l2_1 to l1_1 (airport in c1)
   - Use truck t1 to transport p2 from l1_1 to l1_3

Let's work out the detailed plan:

1. Move truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_4:
   `drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2`

2. Load package p1 into truck t2 at l2_4:
   `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4`

3. Load package p2 into truck t2 at l2_4:
   `loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4`

4. Drive truck t2 back to l2_1:
   `drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2`

5. Unload package p1 from truck t2 at l2_1:
   `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1`
   
   (Goal 1 achieved: p1 is in l2_1)

6. Load package p2 from truck t2 into airplane a2 at l2_1:
   `unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1`
   `loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1`

7. Fly airplane a2 from l2_1 to l1_1:
   `flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1`

8. Unload package p2 from airplane a2 at l1_1:
   `unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1`

9. Move truck t1 from l1_3 to l1_1:
   `drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1`

10. Load package p2 into truck t1 at l1_1:
    `loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1`

11. Drive truck t1 from l1_1 to l1_3:
    `drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1`

12. Unload package p2 from truck t1 at l1_3:
    `unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3`
    
    (Goal 2 achieved: p2 is in l1_3)

Wait, I've noticed something wrong in the problem statement. It says:
- "loadairplane p ap l": Load package p in airplane ap. Both p and ap are in location l.
- "loadairplane p ap l": Unload package p from airplane ap in location l.

Both loading and unloading an airplane have the same action name. I believe the second one should be "unloadairplane". Let's assume the correct actions are:
- "loadairplane p ap l": Load package p in airplane ap. Both p and ap are in location l.
- "unloadairplane p ap l": Unload package p from airplane ap in location l.

With this assumption, my plan should be correct.

Let me double-check the plan:

1. `drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2` - Preconditions: t2 is in l2_1, l2_1 and l2_4 are in c2 ✓
2. `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4` - Preconditions: p1 and t2 are in l2_4 ✓
3. `loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4` - Preconditions: p2 and t2 are in l2_4 ✓
4. `drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2` - Preconditions: t2 is in l2_4, l2_4 and l2_1 are in c2 ✓
5. `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1` - Preconditions: t2 is in l2_1, p1 is in t2 ✓
6. `unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1` - Preconditions: t2 is in l2_1, p2 is in t2 ✓
7. `loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1` - Preconditions: p2 and a2 are in l2_1 ✓
8. `flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1` - Preconditions: a2 is in l2_1 ✓
9. `unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1` - Preconditions: a2 is in l1_1, p2 is in a2 ✓
10. `drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1` - Preconditions: t1 is in l1_3, l1_3 and l1_1 are in c1 ✓
11. `loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1` - Preconditions: p2 and t1 are in l1_1 ✓
12. `drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1` - Preconditions: t1 is in l1_1, l1_1 and l1_3 are in c1 ✓
13. `unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3` - Preconditions: t1 is in l1_3, p2 is in t1 ✓

This plan seems feasible and optimal, as it uses the minimum number of actions to achieve both goals.

Here's the final plan:
```
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
```

Wait, I found one more issue. The problem statement says there's an action:
- "loadairplane p ap l": Unload package p from airplane ap in location l.

But in my plan, I used `unloadairplane` which isn't defined in the problem. Let's reread the problem statement:

The actions are:
- "loadtruck p t l"
- "loadairplane p ap l" 
- "unloadtruck p t l"
- "loadairplane p ap l" (duplicated)
- "drivetruck t l_from l_to c"
- "flyairplane ap l_from l_to"

Given that there's a "loadtruck" and "unloadtruck", it's logical that there should be "loadairplane" and "unloadairplane". Since "loadairplane" is mentioned twice, I think the second one should be "unloadairplane". In my plan, I've used "unloadairplane", but to adhere to the exact problem statement, I should replace it with "loadairplane" (assuming the second mention is correct).

Wait actually, if we look at the preconditions, the first "loadairplane" is for loading a package into an airplane, and the second one is for unloading. The actions have different preconditions and effects, so they are different actions. Let's clarify this by looking at the effects:

- "loadairplane": After loading a package p in an airplane ap at location l, (i) p is no longer situated in l, and (ii) p is in ap.
- "unloadairplane": After unloading a package p from an airplane ap in a location l, (i) p is no longer in ap, and (ii) p is situated in l.

So there is indeed an "unloadairplane" action. But in the list of available actions, it's mistakenly listed as "loadairplane" twice. So, I'll stick with "unloadairplane" in my plan.

But wait, let me double-check the action names again:

The actions are:
- "loadtruck p t l": Load package p in truck t.
- "loadairplane p ap l": Load package p in airplane ap.
- "unloadtruck p t l": Unload package p from truck t.
- "loadairplane p ap l": Unload package p from airplane ap (this is likely a typo, it should be "unloadairplane").
- "drivetruck t l_from l_to c": Drive truck t from location l_from to l_to.
- "flyairplane ap l_from l_to": Fly airplane ap from l_from to l_to.

And the preconditions for the fourth action (which is duplicated) are:
- "unloadairplane": You may only unload package p from a airplane ap in a location l if (i) ap is situated in l, and (ii) p is in ap.

So this confirms that the second mention of "loadairplane" should be "unloadairplane". So my original plan with "unloadairplane" is correct.

On second thought, let me double check the problem statement: it says:
"loadairplane p ap l": Load package p in airplane ap. Both p and ap are in location l.
"loadairplane p ap l": Unload package p from airplane ap in location l.

The action name is exactly the same, but the second one is used for unloading. This is confusing. To be safe, I'll stick to using "loadairplane" for both loading and unloading operations, since that's what's explicitly mentioned in the problem statement.

But when I look at the effects section, it clearly says:
"loadairplane": After loading a package p in an airplane ap at location l, (i) p is no longer situated in l, and (ii) p is in ap.
"unloadairplane": After unloading a package p from an airplane ap in a location l, (i) p is no longer in ap, and (ii) p is situated in l.

This indicates that there are two separate actions: "loadairplane" and "unloadairplane". So the second mention of "loadairplane" in the available actions section must be a typo.

Ok, looking at this carefully, I think "unloadairplane" is a action since it is mentioned in the preconditions and effects. However, in the list of available actions, it's mistakenly written as "loadairplane" twice. So, the correct list of actions should be:
- "loadtruck p t l"
- "loadairplane p ap l"
- "unloadtruck p t l"
- "unloadairplane p ap l" (not "loadairplane" again)
- "drivetruck t l_from l_to c"
- "flyairplane ap l_from l_to"

So I'll continue using "unloadairplane" in my plan.

Wait, I'm making things too complicated. Let me go with what the problem statement explicitly says in the list of available actions:
- "loadtruck p t l"
- "loadairplane p ap l"
- "unloadtruck p t l"
- "loadairplane p ap l" (duplicated, but this is what the problem says)
- "drivetruck t l_from l_to c"
- "flyairplane ap l_from l_to"

So, to be literal and adhere to the problem statement, I'll use "loadairplane" for both loading and unloading operations. But since this is ambiguous, I would typically ask for clarification in a real-world scenario.

Actually, I think there is a copying error in the "availabe actions" section, as the second statement should read:
- "unloadairplane p ap l"

Furthermore, in the preconditions section, there is an entry for "unloadairplane", and in the effects section, there is also an entry for "unloadairplane". So I am confident that the action to unload a pacakge from an airplane is "unloadairplane", not "loadairplane".

Let me correct my plan:

```
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
```

I'm confident that this plan is correct.

Now that I've completed the planning, let me double check the initial state again to make sure the implementation is correct:

Starting state:
- Location l1_1 is in city c1 (airport)
- Locations l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5 are in city c1
- Location l2_1 is in city c2 (airport)
- Locations l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5 are in city c2
- Package t1 is in location l1_3 (error: t1 is a truck, not a package)
- Package t2 is in location l2_1 (error: t2 is a truck, not a package)
- Package p1 is in location l2_4
- Package p2 is in location l2_4
- Package a1 is in location l1_1 (error: a1 is an airplane, not a package)
- Package a2 is in location l2_1 (error: a2 is an airplane, not a package)

I assume the intended initial state is:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_3
- Truck t2 is in location l2_1
- Package p1 is in location l2_4
- Package p2 is in location l2_4
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

With this assumption, my plan is correct.

In summary, my final plan is:

```
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
```

This plan should achieve the goal of having package p1 in location l2_1 and package p2 in location l1_3.

Just to be explicit, I'm assuming:
1. The second mention of "loadairplane" in the available actions is a typo, and it should be "unloadairplane".
2. The mentions of packages t1, t2, a1, and a2 in the initial state are errors, and they should be truck t1, truck t2, airplane a1, and airplane a2 respectively.

With these assumptions, the plan is optimal as it uses the minimum number of actions to achieve the goals.

Actually, I just noticed we were told to wrap the plan with triple backticks to delinate the start and the end of the plan, so let's do that explicitly:
```
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
```

Actually, the instructions say to mark the start and end of the problem with "3 '`' characters", not 3 backticks. So let me correct that:

```
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
```

Actually, to make sure I'm following the instructions correctly, let's review them once more:

"Delineate the plan with one top line and one bottom line containing only 3  '`' characters."

So, I'm supposed to include lines with just three backticks at the top and bottom of the plan.

```
```
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
```
```

But I'm finding this formatting a bit awkward. Let me clarify more carefully. We're told to "Delineate the plan with one top line and one bottom line containing only 3  '`' characters."

So, I should have a line with just three backticks at the top of the plan and another line with just three backticks at the bottom.

```
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
```
