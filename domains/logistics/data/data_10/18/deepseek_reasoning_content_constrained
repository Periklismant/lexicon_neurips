Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. So, the goal is to get p1 to l2_1 and p2 to l1_3, right? But there are a bunch of constraints we have to satisfy along the way. Let me start by understanding the initial state and the required conditions.

First, the initial state:
- Locations: c1 has l1_1 (airport), l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5. c2 has l2_1 (airport), l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5.
- Packages: p1 and p2 are both in l2_4 (which is in c2). Trucks t1 is in l1_3 (c1), t2 in l2_1 (c2). Airplanes a1 in l1_1 (c1's airport), a2 in l2_1 (c2's airport).

The goal is p1 in l2_1 and p2 in l1_3.

Now, the constraints. Let's list them out:

1. At some state, p1 is in l1_1.
2. At some state, p2 is in l2_1.
3. If p2 is ever in l2_1, then either p2 was in l2_4 or l1_4 before or after that state.
4. At some state, p1 is in l1_5 or p2 is in a1.
5. At some state, p2 is in l1_1.
6. If p2 is in l1_1, then there's an earlier state where p1 is in l1_4.
7. At some state, p1 is in t1. (This is listed twice, maybe a typo, but we need to ensure it's met.)
8. At some state, p2 is in l1_3 (which is part of the goal, but also a constraint here).
9. If p2 is in l1_3, then earlier there was a state where p1 is in l1_3 or p2 is in l2_3.
10. At some state, p1 is in l1_3.
11. At some state, p2 is in l2_2.
12. Another mention of p1 in t1 (so maybe two instances needed? Or duplicate constraint).
13. At some state, p1 is in l2_2.

Hmm, some constraints might be redundant, but need to check all. Let's plan step by step.

First, moving p1 from l2_4 (c2) to l2_1. Since l2_1 is an airport in c2, maybe using a truck to move it to the airport, then an airplane. But wait, the initial positions of trucks: t2 is in l2_1. So p1 is in l2_4 (c2). So maybe use t2 to drive to l2_4, load p1 into t2, drive back to l2_1, then load into a2 (airplane in l2_1), fly to another airport, but wait, the goal is l2_1 for p1. Wait, no. Wait, the goal is p1 in l2_1. Oh, so maybe p1 just needs to be delivered to l2_1. But p1 starts in l2_4. So how to get it there. Since t2 is in l2_1. So t2 can drive to l2_4 (same city, c2), load p1, drive back to l2_1, unload. Then p1 is in l2_1. That seems straightforward. But let's check the constraints.

But wait, the constraints say that p1 must be in l1_1 at some state. So p1 has to go from c2 to c1's airport. So maybe we need to involve an airplane. Let's see.

Wait, the goal is p1 in l2_1 (which is in c2) and p2 in l1_3 (c1). So p1 needs to stay in c2, but the constraint requires p1 to be in l1_1 (c1's airport). That seems conflicting. Wait, no: the goal is p1 in l2_1 (c2's airport), but the constraint says that in at least one state, p1 must be in l1_1 (c1's airport). So p1 has to be moved to l1_1 at some point, then moved back to l2_1? That complicates things.

Similarly, p2 needs to go from l2_4 (c2) to l1_3 (c1). So that requires moving between cities, which probably needs airplanes.

So let's outline the steps for both packages.

For p1:

Start in l2_4 (c2). To get to l2_1 (c2's airport). But the constraints require p1 to be in l1_1 (c1's airport) at some point. So p1 must first go from l2_4 to l2_1 (via truck t2), then be loaded into airplane a2 (which is already at l2_1). Fly a2 to l1_1 (c1's airport). Then unload p1 there. Then, to get p1 back to l2_1, we need to load it back into a2 (but a2 is now in l1_1?), then fly back. But wait, airplanes can fly between airports. So a2 is in l2_1. So to get p1 to l1_1, we need to fly a2 to l1_1, but that's in a different city. Wait, no. Wait, airplanes can fly between any airports, regardless of city? The problem says "airplanes may move between airports." So airports are locations in cities, but the cities might not matter for airplanes. So yes, a2 can fly from l2_1 (c2) to l1_1 (c1), but need to check if the flyairplane action allows that. The flyairplane action's precondition is that the airplane is in l_from. So yes, as long as a2 is in l2_1, it can fly to l1_1.

So steps for p1:

1. Use truck t2 (in l2_1) to drive to l2_4 (same city c2). drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
2. Load p1 into t2 at l2_4. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
3. Drive t2 back to l2_1. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
4. Unload p1 at l2_1. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 → Now p1 is in l2_1. But the constraint requires p1 to be in l1_1 at some point. So after this, we need to move p1 to l1_1.

So then:

5. Load p1 into a2 (which is at l2_1). loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
6. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
7. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 → Now p1 is in l1_1, satisfying the first constraint. Then, to get it back to l2_1:

8. Load p1 into a1 (which is in l1_1) → but a1 is in l1_1. Wait, a1 is in l1_1 (initial state: "Package a1 is in location l1_1" — wait, wait, no: looking back at the original state, the "Package a1" is in l1_1. Wait, no, the original state says:

Wait, the original state lists:

"Package t1 is in location l1_3"

"Package t2 is in location l2_1"

"Package p1 is in location l2_4"

"Package p2 is in location l2_4"

"Package a1 is in location l1_1"

"Package a2 is in location l2_1"

Wait, that's a mistake. Wait, the objects include trucks t1, t2; airplanes a1, a2. So the original state probably has:

"truck t1 is in location l1_3"

"truck t2 is in location l2_1"

"airplane a1 is in location l1_1"

"airplane a2 is in location l2_1"

But the user wrote "Package t1", etc. That's probably a typo. Because t1 is a truck. So I need to correct that in my understanding. So initial state:

- Truck t1 is in l1_3 (c1)
- Truck t2 is in l2_1 (c2)
- Airplane a1 is in l1_1 (c1)
- Airplane a2 is in l2_1 (c2)
- Packages p1 and p2 are in l2_4 (c2)

So, for p1's journey to l1_1:

After step 4, p1 is in l2_1. Then, load into a2 (which is in l2_1), fly to l1_1 (c1's airport), unload. Then, to get back to l2_1, we need to load p1 into a1 (which is in l1_1) and fly back? But a1 is in l1_1. So fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1, but wait, l2_1 is in c2. But airplanes can fly between any airports. So:

After step 7 (p1 in l1_1):

8. Load p1 into a1. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
9. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
10. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 → Now p1 is back in l2_1, which is the goal.

But this seems lengthy. But maybe necessary to satisfy the constraint that p1 is in l1_1. However, this adds steps. Also, we need to check other constraints.

Now, for p2: starts in l2_4 (c2), needs to go to l1_3 (c1). So need to move between cities. So likely using airplane.

Possible steps for p2:

1. Use truck t2 (in l2_1) to drive to l2_4. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
2. Load p2 into t2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
3. Drive t2 back to l2_1. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
4. Unload p2 into l2_1. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 → Now p2 is in l2_1, satisfying constraint 2. But then, according to constraint 3, if p2 is in l2_1, then either p2 was in l2_4 (which it was) or l1_4 at s or after. Since p2 was in l2_4 before, that's okay. So constraint 3 is satisfied.

Then, load p2 into a2 (in l2_1) and fly to l1_1 (c1's airport). Then unload, then use truck t1 (in l1_3) to drive to l1_1, load p2, drive to l1_3, unload. Wait, but t1 is in l1_3. So:

5. Load p2 into a2. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
6. Fly a2 to l1_1. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
7. Unload p2 from a2 into l1_1. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 → Now p2 is in l1_1, satisfying constraint 5. Then, to get to l1_3:

8. Use truck t1 (in l1_3) to drive to l1_1. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
9. Load p2 into t1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
10. Drive back to l1_3. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
11. Unload p2. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 → Now p2 is in l1_3, meeting the goal.

But during this process, let's check the constraints:

- Constraint 4: At some state, p1 is in l1_5 or p2 is in a1. Let's see. In the p1 steps, when p1 is loaded into a1 (step 8), which is in l1_1. So when p1 is in a1, that would satisfy "p2 is in a1"? No, that's p1 in a1. Wait, the constraint is "Package p1 is in l1_5" OR "Package p2 is in a1". So maybe during the p2 steps, if we load p2 into a1 at some point. Alternatively, move p1 to l1_5. Let's see.

In the current plan for p1, after step 10, p1 is in l2_1. But in the steps for p1, during the process, after step 7, p1 is in l1_1. Then step 8 is loading into a1. So maybe after step 8, p1 is in a1. Then, step 9 is flying a1 to l2_1. But during that flight, p1 is in a1. So perhaps the constraint can be satisfied during this step. Wait, the constraint is that in at least one state, "Package p1 is in l1_5" OR "Package p2 is in a1". Let's see.

If we can get p2 into a1 at some point. For example, when p2 is in l1_1 (step 7 of p2's plan), we could load p2 into a1 (which is in l1_1), then fly a1 to l2_1. But that would require:

After step 7 (p2 in l1_1), load p2 into a1. Then fly a1 to l2_1, then unload. But then p2 would end up in l2_1, which is not the goal. So that's a problem. Alternatively, maybe during the process of moving p1, we can have p2 in a1.

Alternatively, maybe use a1 to transport p2. Let's think. Let's adjust the p2 plan:

Instead of using a2 to fly p2 to l1_1, maybe use a1. But a1 is in l1_1 initially. So to get a1 to l2_1 to load p2, then fly back. But that's complicated. Alternatively, after moving p1 to l1_1, perhaps load p2 into a1 when it's in l1_1.

Wait, in the p2 plan, after step 7, p2 is in l1_1. Then, if we load p2 into a1 (which is in l1_1), that would satisfy the constraint "p2 is in a1". Then, we can unload p2 from a1 in l1_1 again (but that's redundant). So perhaps:

After step 7 of p2's plan (p2 in l1_1), do:

8. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 → Now p2 is in a1. This satisfies constraint 4 (since p2 is in a1). Then unload p2 from a1 in l1_1 again (unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1), then proceed to load into truck t1. But this adds steps. But maybe necessary for the constraint.

Alternatively, after loading p2 into a1, fly a1 to l1_3's airport? Wait, no. The airports are l1_1 and l2_1. So other locations are not airports. So to move p2 from l1_1 to l1_3, which is in the same city, we need a truck. So the original plan to use t1 is okay.

But including loading p2 into a1 would add steps but satisfy constraint 4. Let's see:

In the adjusted p2 plan:

After step 7 (p2 in l1_1):

8. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 → Now p2 is in a1. This satisfies constraint 4 (p2 is in a1). Then:

9. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 → Now p2 is back in l1_1.

Then proceed with truck steps. So this adds two actions but satisfies the constraint. So this is necessary.

Now, let's check other constraints.

Constraint 6: If p2 is in l1_1 (which happens in step 7 of p2's plan), then there must be an earlier state where p1 is in l1_4. So before p2 is in l1_1, p1 must have been in l1_4 at some point. How can we arrange that?

In the current p1 plan, p1 is moved to l1_1 (step 7). To get p1 into l1_4, perhaps we need to move it there before or after.

Wait, in the p1 plan, after step 7, p1 is in l1_1. Then, when we load it into a1 (step 8), and fly to l2_1. So to get p1 into l1_4, perhaps after step 7 (p1 in l1_1), use truck t1 (in l1_3) to drive to l1_1, load p1, drive to l1_4, unload. Then, pick it up again. But that complicates the plan.

Alternatively, maybe during the movement of p1, after being in l1_1, we move it to l1_4. But why? Because we need to have p1 in l1_4 before p2 is in l1_1.

Wait, the constraint is: if p2 is in l1_1 (which happens in step 7 of p2's plan), then there must be an earlier state where p1 was in l1_4. So in the p1 plan, before p2 reaches l1_1, we need to have p1 in l1_4.

But in the current p1 plan, p1 is moved to l1_1 (step 7), then loaded into a1 (step 8). So before p2 is in l1_1 (step 7 of p2's plan), we need to have p1 in l1_4. But how?

Wait, the timing between the two plans (p1 and p2) is concurrent. So maybe the steps for p1 and p2 are interleaved. Let's think about the order.

The initial steps for p1 and p2 can be done in parallel. For example:

1. Move t2 to l2_4, load p1 and p2, drive back to l2_1. But wait, trucks can carry multiple packages, but each load and unload is per package. So for p1 and p2:

Wait, both p1 and p2 are in l2_4. So t2 can drive to l2_4, load both packages, then drive back. But each load is a separate action.

So steps for both:

For p1 and p2:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
3. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
4. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
5. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
6. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

Now both p1 and p2 are in l2_1. Then, p1 can be loaded into a2 and flown to l1_1, etc. But this way, steps are saved.

But let's see how this affects the constraints.

So after these steps, p2 is in l2_1, satisfying constraint 2. Then, constraint 3: since p2 was in l2_4 before, that's okay.

Now, for p1 to reach l1_1, we load into a2 (in l2_1), fly to l1_1.

So steps:

7. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
8. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
9. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 → Now p1 is in l1_1 (constraint 1 met).

Then, to get p1 back to l2_1:

10. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (a1 is in l1_1)
11. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
12. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 → p1 in l2_1 (goal met).

For p2: after step 6, p2 is in l2_1. To get to l1_3:

13. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (a2 is in l2_1 after flying p1 to l1_1)
Wait, after step 8, a2 is in l1_1. So after step 8, a2 is in l1_1, so can't be used to load p2 in l2_1. So maybe we need to use a different airplane. Or adjust the order.

Alternatively, after step 6, p2 is in l2_1. To move p2 to l1_1, we can use a2 (which is in l2_1) to fly to l1_1:

7. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
8. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
9. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 → Now p2 is in l1_1 (satisfies constraint 5). Then, to get to l1_3:

10. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
11. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
12. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
13. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 → Goal met for p2.

But in this case, the constraint 6 says that if p2 is in l1_1 (step 9), then there must be an earlier state where p1 is in l1_4. So before step 9, p1 must have been in l1_4.

But in this plan, p1's journey is steps 7-9: p1 is loaded into a2 and flown to l1_1. But how does p1 get to l1_4? It seems not. So we need to adjust the plan to ensure that p1 is in l1_4 at some point before p2 is in l1_1.

So perhaps after p1 is in l1_1 (step 9 of the p1 plan), we need to move p1 to l1_4 using truck t1. But that would be after p2 is already in l1_1, which violates the constraint. So we need p1 to be in l1_4 before p2 is in l1_1.

This complicates things. Let's think.

Alternative approach: before moving p2 to l1_1, ensure p1 is in l1_4.

But how can p1 get to l1_4? Since p1 is initially in l2_4 (c2), then moved to l2_1, then flown to l1_1 (c1), then perhaps loaded into truck t1 and driven to l1_4.

Wait, after p1 is in l1_1 (step 9 of p1's plan), we can:

14. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
15. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
16. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
17. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4 → Now p1 is in l1_4.

But this would be after p2 is already in l1_1 (step 9 of p2's plan), so the constraint 6 would not be satisfied. Therefore, we need to have p1 in l1_4 before p2 is in l1_1.

So perhaps, after p1 is flown to l1_1 (step 9), before moving p2 to l1_1, move p1 to l1_4.

But then, how to get p1 back to l2_1 later.

Alternatively, maybe p1 needs to go to l1_4 before being flown to l1_1. But that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the steps are interleaved. For example:

- Move p1 to l2_1 (initial steps)
- Move p1 to l1_1 via a2
- Then move p1 to l1_4 using t1
- Then proceed to move p2 to l1_1, which would satisfy constraint 6.

But then p1 needs to be moved back to l2_1, which requires flying again.

This is getting complicated. Let's outline the steps again with interleaved actions to meet all constraints.

Let me attempt a step-by-step plan with interleaved actions for p1 and p2, ensuring all constraints are met.

1. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2 (t2 goes to l2_4)
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (load p1)
3. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (load p2)
4. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2 (drive back to l2_1)
5. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (p1 now in l2_1)
6. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (p2 now in l2_1; satisfies constraint 2)

Now, p1 needs to go to l1_1 (constraint 1), and p2 needs to go to l1_3 (goal). But let's handle constraints in order.

Next, for p1 to reach l1_1:

7. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (a2 is at l2_1)
8. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (fly to c1's airport)
9. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (p1 in l1_1; meets constraint 1)

Now, p1 is in l1_1. To get back to l2_1, we can use a1:

10. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (a1 is at l1_1)
11. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (fly to c2's airport)
12. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 (p1 now in l2_1; goal met)

But before that, need to handle the constraints related to p2.

For p2, after step 6, it's in l2_1. To move to l1_3:

13. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (but a2 is at l1_1 now; so cannot. Oops, after step 8, a2 is in l1_1. So we need to use another airplane. Wait, a2 is in l1_1 after step 8, so to fly p2 to l1_1, we need to use a different airplane. Let's see available airplanes: a1 is in l1_1 initially, but after step 10, a1 is loaded with p1 and flown to l2_1. Hmm, this complicates things.

Alternatively, after step 9, a2 is in l1_1. So to move p2 from l2_1 to l1_1, we need another airplane. But the only other airplane is a1, which is in l1_1. So we can fly a1 to l2_1, load p2, and fly back.

But let's see:

After step 6, p2 is in l2_1.

To move p2 to l1_1:

7. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (a2 is in l2_1)
8. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (now a2 is in l1_1)
9. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (p2 in l1_1; meets constraint 5)

But now, constraint 6 requires that before p2 is in l1_1 (step 9), p1 must have been in l1_4. So before step 9, p1 needs to be in l1_4.

But currently, p1 is still in l2_1 after step 6. Wait, in this alternative plan, after step 6, p1 is in l2_1 (from step 5). So how can p1 get to l1_4 before p2 is in l1_1 (step 9)? It's impossible unless we have p1 moved to l1_4 first.

Wait, this approach is not working. Let's try to reorder steps.

Alternative approach:

First, move p1 and p2 to l2_1.

Then, move p2 to l1_1 via a2.

But before moving p2 to l1_1, ensure p1 is in l1_4.

So after moving p1 to l2_1:

- Move p1 to l1_1 via a2.
- Then move p1 to l1_4 using truck t1.
- Then move p2 to l1_1, which requires p1 to have been in l1_4 before.

But how:

Steps:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
3. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
4. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
5. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
6. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

Now p1 and p2 are in l2_1.

7. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
8. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
9. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 → p1 in l1_1 (constraint 1 met)

10. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1 (t1 drives to l1_1)
11. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
12. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
13. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4 → p1 in l1_4 (now, this is before p2 is moved to l1_1)

Now, p1 is in l1_4. Then, proceed to move p2 to l1_1:

14. loadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (a2 is in l1_1 after step 8)
15. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1 (fly back to l2_1 to load p2? Wait, no. Wait, p2 is in l2_1. So to move p2 to l1_1, need to load it into an airplane in l2_1. But after step 8, a2 is in l1_1. So a2 is not available in l2_1. So need to use another airplane. The only other airplane is a1, which is in l1_1 initially.

Wait, a1 is in l1_1. So if we want to use a1 to transport p2 from l2_1 to l1_1, we need to fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1, load p2, then fly back. So steps:

14. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (a1 now in l2_1)
15. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
16. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1 (a1 back to l1_1)
17. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 → p2 in l1_1 (constraint 5 met). Now, before this step (17), p1 was in l1_4 (step 13). So constraint 6 is satisfied (p1 was in l1_4 before p2 is in l1_1).

Now, after p2 is in l1_1 (step 17), we need to move it to l1_3 using truck t1:

18. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 (t1 is in l1_4 after step 12)
19. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
20. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
21. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 → p2 in l1_3 (goal met)

For p1, after step 13, p1 is in l1_4. We need to get it back to l2_1. How?

22. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4 (t1 is now in l1_3 after step 20. So need to move t1 back to l1_4. Hmm, this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, after step 13, p1 is in l1_4. To get it back to l1_1:

22. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
23. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
24. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
25. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 → p1 in l1_3 (constraint 10 met)

Then, to move p1 from l1_3 to l2_1:

But l1_3 is in c1. So need to use an airplane. But p1 is in l1_3. So use truck t1 to drive to l1_1, load into a1, fly to l2_1.

26. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
27. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
28. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (p1 in l1_1)
29. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
30. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
31. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 → p1 in l2_1 (goal met)

But this is a very long plan. Let's check if all constraints are met:

Constraints:

1. p1 in l1_1: steps 9 and 28.
2. p2 in l2_1: step 6.
3. If p2 in l2_1 (step6), then p2 was in l2_4 before (yes).
4. p1 in l1_5 or p2 in a1: let's see. In step 15, p2 is loaded into a1 (l2_1). So step15: loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1. Then p2 is in a1. So this meets constraint4.
5. p2 in l1_1: step17.
6. If p2 in l1_1 (step17), then earlier p1 in l1_4 (step13) → yes.
7. p1 in t1: steps 11, 23, 27 (when loaded into t1)
8. p2 in l1_3: step21 (goal met)
9. If p2 in l1_3 (step21), then earlier p1 in l1_3 or p2 in l2_3. Let's see: p1 is in l1_3 step25. So before step21, p1 is in l1_3 at step25, but step21 is after. Hmm, need to check the order. Wait, step25 is after step21. So this doesn't satisfy. So constraint9 requires that before p2 is in l1_3, there was a state where p1 is in l1_3 or p2 in l2_3. But in this plan, p1 is in l1_3 only after p2 is already there. So this violates constraint9.

Ah, this is a problem. So we need to ensure that before p2 is in l1_3 (step21), there's a state where p1 is in l1_3 or p2 is in l2_3.

In this plan, p1 is in l1_3 at step25, which is after p2 is in l1_3. So that's too late. So we need to adjust.

How can we get p1 in l1_3 before p2 is in l1_3?

Alternatively, have p2 in l2_3 at some point.

p2 starts in l2_4. To get to l2_3, use truck t2:

But t2 is in l2_1 after step4. So steps after step6 (p2 in l2_1):

7. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
8. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
9. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
10. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 → but this would make p2 in l2_1 again, but having been in l2_3. But this adds steps and may help with constraint9.

Then proceed as before. But this seems convoluted.

Alternatively, during the movement of p2 to l1_3, pass through l2_3.

But l2_3 is in c2, and p2 needs to go to c1. So not directly helpful.

Alternatively, when p2 is moved from l2_4 to l2_1 via truck, drive through l2_3. But the drivetruck action can go directly from l2_4 to l2_1 if they are connected. But the problem doesn't specify the connectivity between locations. Are trucks allowed to drive between any two locations in the same city? The problem states: "Trucks may move between locations in a city". So presumably, any location in the same city is reachable. So maybe the drivetruck action can go from any location to any other in the same city. So, for example, t2 can drive from l2_1 to l2_3 directly.

But the initial steps for p2 are to move from l2_4 to l2_1. So adding a detour via l2_3 would allow p2 to be in l2_3, satisfying the condition.

So modifying steps:

After step6 (p2 in l2_1):

7. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2 (drive t2 to l2_3)
8. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (p2 is now in t2 in l2_3)
9. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2 (drive back)
10. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (p2 back in l2_1)

Now, during step8, p2 is in l2_3. So this satisfies the condition for constraint9: if p2 is in l1_3 (later), then there's an earlier state where p2 was in l2_3. So this would satisfy constraint9.

But this adds more steps. However, it's necessary.

But this makes the plan even longer. But it's required to meet the constraint.

So incorporating this into the plan:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
3. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
4. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
5. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
6. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
7. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2 (move to l2_3)
8. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (p2 in t2 at l2_3)
9. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2 (return)
10. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (p2 back in l2_1)

Now, step8 satisfies that p2 is in l2_3. So later, when p2 is in l1_3 (goal), the constraint9 is met because there was a state (step8) where p2 was in l2_3.

Now, proceeding with moving p1 and p2:

11. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
12. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
13. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 → p1 in l1_1 (constraint1)
14. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1 (t1 moves to l1_1)
15. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
16. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
17. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4 → p1 in l1_4 (before p2 is moved to l1_1)
18. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (a1 is in l1_1 initially, so need to fly to l2_1)
Wait, a1 is initially in l1_1. So to load p2 into a1, which is in l2_1, we need to fly a1 to l2_1 first.

But p2 is in l2_1. So steps:

18. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (a1 now in l2_1)
19. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (p2 in a1)
20. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1 (a1 back to l1_1)
21. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 → p2 in l1_1 (constraint5 met)
22. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 (t1 moves back to l1_1)
23. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
24. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
25. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 → p2 in l1_3 (goal met; constraint8)

For p1, after step17 (in l1_4), need to move back to l2_1:

26. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1 (after step24, t1 is in l1_3)
27. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
28. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
29. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 → p1 in l1_1
30. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (a1 is in l1_1 after step20)
31. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
32. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 → p1 in l2_1 (goal met)

Now, checking the constraints:

- Constraint9: p2 in l1_3 (step25). Earlier, p2 was in l2_3 (step8). So satisfies "at least one condition (p2 in l2_3)" holds before. So yes.

- Constraint10: p1 in l1_3: step29, p1 is in l1_1, no. Wait, no. In this plan, p1 is in l1_4 (step17), then moved to l1_1 (step29). Then loaded into a1 and flown to l2_1. So p1 is never in l1_3. So constraint10 is not met.

Constraint10 says: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "Package p1 is in location l1_3"". So we need to have p1 in l1_3 at some point.

In this plan, after step17, p1 is in l1_4. Then moved to l1_1 (step29), then flown to l2_1. So p1 is never in l1_3. So this is a problem.

To fix this, we need to have p1 in l1_3 at some point.

How? Perhaps after step17, drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_3 and unload p1 there.

But let's adjust the plan:

After step17 (p1 in l1_4):

26. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1 (drive to l1_3)
27. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 → p1 in l1_3 (constraint10 met)
28. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (to move it back)
29. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
30. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 → p1 in l1_1
31. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
32. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
33. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 → p1 in l2_1 (goal)

Now, step27 satisfies constraint10.

But this adds more steps. Let's check:

- After step17: t1 is in l1_4 with p1 in it.
- step26: drive to l1_3.
- step27: unload p1 into l1_3 (constraint10 met)
- step28: load p1 back into t1.
- step29: drive to l1_1.
- step30: unload p1 into l1_1.
- Then proceed to fly to l2_1.

Now, all constraints should be met.

Let's verify all constraints:

1. p1 in l1_1: steps13,30.
2. p2 in l2_1: step6,10.
3. If p2 in l2_1 (steps6,10), then p2 was in l2_4 or l1_4. Since p2 was in l2_4 before (step3), this is satisfied.
4. p1 in l1_5 or p2 in a1: step19, p2 is loaded into a1 (l2_1), so yes.
5. p2 in l1_1: step21.
6. If p2 in l1_1 (step21), earlier state with p1 in l1_4 (step17) → yes.
7. p1 in t1: steps15,28, and others.
8. p2 in l1_3: step25 (goal).
9. If p2 in l1_3 (step25), earlier state with p1 in l1_3 (step27) or p2 in l2_3 (step8). Yes, step8.
10. p1 in l1_3: step27.
11. p2 in l2_2: Not yet addressed. Wait, constraint11 requires p2 in l2_2 at some state.

Oh, right! I missed constraint11: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "Package p2 is in location l2_2"". So in the current plan, p2 is never in l2_2. So this is a problem.

So need to add steps to get p2 to l2_2.

How can p2 get to l2_2? Since p2 is in l2_1 (step10), we can use truck t2 to drive to l2_2 and unload.

Steps after step10:

11. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2 (drive to l2_2)
12. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (p2 is in t2 at l2_2)
13. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 → p2 in l2_2 (constraint11 met)
14. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (to continue moving)
15. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 (drive back)
16. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (p2 back in l2_1)

But this adds steps. Now, after step16, p2 is back in l2_1. Then proceed with moving p1 and p2 as before.

But this significantly increases the plan length. However, it's necessary to meet constraint11.

So incorporating these steps:

After step10 (p2 in l2_1):

11. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
12. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
13. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 → p2 in l2_2 (constraint11)
14. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
15. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
16. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

Now, continue with moving p1 and p2:

17. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
18. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
19. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 → p1 in l1_1 (constraint1)
20. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
21. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
22. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
23. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4 → p1 in l1_4 (before p2 is moved to l1_1)
24. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
25. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
26. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
27. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 → p2 in l1_1 (constraint5)
28. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
29. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
30. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
31. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 → p2 in l1_3 (goal)
32. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1
33. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4 (wait, p1 is already in l1_4 from step23)
34. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
35. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1
36. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 → p1 in l1_3 (constraint10)
37. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
38. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
39. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
40. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
41. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
42. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 → p1 in l2_1 (goal)

This is getting excessively long. I'm probably missing a more optimal path. But given the time constraints, perhaps I should look for a way to satisfy all constraints with fewer steps.

Alternatively, when moving p2 from l2_1 to l1_1, make a stop at l2_2. But since p2 is in l2_1, we can drive t2 to l2_2, unload p2 there (meeting constraint11), then reload and continue.

So steps after step10:

11. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
12. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 → p2 in l2_2 (constraint11)
13. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
14. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
15. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

Now, p2 has been in l2_2 (step12). Proceed as before.

This adds four steps but meets constraint11.

Finally, the plan is very long, but I think it's necessary to meet all constraints. However, the user requested an optimal plan (shortest possible). So perhaps there's a smarter way.

Let me try to find a shorter path.

Alternative idea:

Use a2 to transport p1 to l1_1, then use a1 to transport p2 from l2_1 to l1_1, but during that process, ensure p1 is in l1_4 and p2 passes through required locations.

But I'm running out of time. Given the complexity, I'll proceed to outline the steps as per the latest plan, ensuring all constraints are met, even if it's lengthy.

The final plan would look something like:

```
```
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
```
```

But this is very long. However, considering the constraints, it's necessary. The user requested an optimal plan, but given the complexity, this might be the shortest possible. Alternatively, I might have missed a more efficient sequence. But under time constraints, this is the best I can do.
