Okay, let's try to figure out this planning problem. So, the goal is to get p1 to l2_4 and p2 to l1_5. But there are a bunch of constraints we need to satisfy along the way. Let me start by understanding the initial state and the constraints.

First, the initial state: p1 is at l1_4 (which is in c1), p2 is at l2_4 (in c2). The trucks and airplanes are in different locations. Trucks can move within their city, airplanes between airports. So, to move packages between cities, we probably need airplanes.

Let's list out all the constraints to make sure I don't miss any. The constraints are a bit complex, so I need to check each one:

1. At least one state where p1 is in l1_4. Well, that's the initial state, so that's already satisfied. Wait, but do we need to make sure that this state is part of the plan? The initial state is already given, so maybe this constraint is automatically met. The problem says "must hold in at least one state", so maybe the initial state counts. But need to confirm if the constraints refer to states in the plan or any state. Since the initial state is part of the problem, I think that constraint is already satisfied.

Wait, the first constraint is "Package p1 is in location l1_4" must hold in at least one state. Since the initial state has p1 at l1_4, that's covered. So that's okay. But then there's a conditional constraint: if p1 is in l1_4 in some state s, then either p2 is in l2_3 or l1_2 must hold in s or after. But since the initial state is s0 where p1 is at l1_4, we need to ensure that in the plan, either p2 is moved to l2_3 or l1_2 at some point after s0. So maybe during the plan, p2 has to be in one of those locations at some point after the initial state.

Other constraints:

3. At least one state where p1 is in l2_3 and p2 is in l1_4. So we need both to be true at the same time in some state.

4. p2 must be in a1 (airplane a1) at some state.

5. p2 must be in l2_1 (the airport in c2) at some state.

6. If p2 is in l2_1 in some state, there must be an earlier state where p2 is in l2_5 or p1 is in l2_2.

7. p1 must be in l2_1 (airport in c2) at some state.

8. If p1 is in l2_1, there must be an earlier state where p1 is in l2_3 or l1_5.

9. p2 must be in l1_5 (the goal, but this is also a constraint to happen at some state, which the goal requires at the end).

10. If p2 is in l1_5, there must be an earlier state where p1 is in l2_2 or p2 is in l1_4.

11. p2 must be in l2_3 at some state.

12. p1 must be in a2 (airplane a2) at some state.

13. p2 must be in l1_1 (airport in c1) at some state.

14. If p2 is in l1_1, then either p1 is in l2_2 or p2 is in l1_4 must hold at that state or after.

15. p2 must be in l1_4 at some state. But the initial state has p2 in l2_4, so this requires moving p2 to l1_4, then maybe back?

This is a lot. Let's see. The main goal is to get p1 to l2_4 and p2 to l1_5, but along the way, all these constraints must be satisfied.

Let me try to outline a possible path.

First, moving p1 from l1_4 (c1) to l2_4 (c2). To do that, we might need to use a truck to move p1 to the airport in c1 (l1_1), load it onto airplane a1, fly to c2's airport (l2_1), unload, then use a truck in c2 to move it to l2_4. But wait, the initial positions: a1 is at l1_1 (correct), a2 is at l2_1. So a1 is in c1's airport, a2 in c2's.

But for p1 to get to l2_4, which is in c2, we need to transport it via airplane. Similarly, p2 needs to go from l2_4 (c2) to l1_5 (c1), which would require airplane transport as well.

But there are multiple constraints that complicate this. Let's tackle them step by step.

First, let's handle the constraints that require certain packages to be in certain locations or vehicles.

Constraint 12: p1 must be in a2. But a2 is the airplane in c2's airport. So to load p1 into a2, we need to have a2 in l2_1 (its initial location) and p1 there as well. But p1 starts in c1. So we need to get p1 to l2_1, then load it into a2. But why would we do that? Because the constraint requires p1 to be in a2 at some state. So even if we unload it later, we need to have that step.

Similarly, constraint 4: p2 must be in a1. a1 is in c1's airport. So p2 needs to be loaded into a1 at some point. But p2 starts in c2. So we need to transport p2 to c1's airport (l1_1) and load it into a1.

Constraint 13: p2 must be in l1_1 (c1's airport). That can happen when unloading from a1. But to get p2 to l1_1, we need to fly it there via airplane. So perhaps p2 is flown to l1_1, then unloaded, which would satisfy this constraint.

Constraint 5: p2 must be in l2_1 (c2's airport). Initially, p2 is in l2_4. So perhaps when moving p2 via truck to l2_1 (airport), then load into airplane, but that would require moving it to the airport. Wait, l2_1 is the airport in c2. So maybe drive p2 from l2_4 to l2_1 via truck t2. But t2's initial location is l2_5. Wait, initial state says "Package t1 is in location l1_5" and "Package t2 is in location l2_5". Wait, wait, the initial state lists "Package t1 is in location l1_5", but t1 is a truck. Wait, that's a mistake in the problem statement. Let me check.

Looking back: The original state says:

"Package t1 is in location l1_5"

"Package t2 is in location l2_5"

But t1 and t2 are trucks. So that must be a typo. Probably, it's supposed to be "Truck t1 is in location l1_5", same for t2. Because otherwise, packages named t1 and t2 are present, which are not mentioned in the objects. The objects include "truck t1", "truck t2". So the initial state probably has the trucks in those locations, not packages. So I'll assume that the initial state is:

Truck t1 is in l1_5.

Truck t2 is in l2_5.

Similarly, "Package a1 is in location l1_1" â€” but a1 is an airplane. Wait, the objects list "airplane a1", "airplane a2". So again, the initial state probably has airplanes in those locations. So the correct initial state should be:

Airplane a1 is in l1_1.

Airplane a2 is in l2_1.

But the problem statement says:

"Package a1 is in location l1_1"

"Package a2 is in location l2_1"

But that's incorrect because a1 and a2 are airplanes, not packages. So this is a problem. Wait, maybe the problem statement has a typo. Let me check again.

In the problem statement under "The original state of the world is the following", it lists:

"Package t1 is in location l1_5"

"Package t2 is in location l2_5"

"Package p1 is in location l1_4"

"Package p2 is in location l2_4"

"Package a1 is in location l1_1"

"Package a2 is in location l2_1"

Wait, this is confusing. Because t1 and t2 are trucks, a1 and a2 are airplanes. So the initial state is incorrect. This must be a mistake. Because otherwise, the packages are named t1, t2, a1, a2, which are not part of the objects. The objects include packages p1 and p2. So the correct initial state for the trucks and airplanes should be:

Truck t1 is in l1_5.

Truck t2 is in l2_5.

Airplane a1 is in l1_1.

Airplane a2 is in l2_1.

And the packages p1 and p2 are in their respective locations.

So the problem statement has a typo here. But since the user provided this, I have to work with it. Wait, no, the user is the one who provided the problem statement. So perhaps the user made a mistake. Wait, looking back:

The user's problem statement under "The original state of the world is the following" includes:

"Package t1 is in location l1_5"

"Package t2 is in location l2_5"

"Package p1 is in location l1_4"

"Package p2 is in location l2_4"

"Package a1 is in location l1_1"

"Package a2 is in location l2_1"

But according to the objects listed, the packages are p1 and p2. The trucks are t1 and t2. The airplanes are a1 and a2. So the initial state is wrong. But perhaps this is a translation error, and the user intended to say that the trucks and airplanes are in those locations, not packages. Because otherwise, there are packages named t1, t2, a1, a2 which are not in the objects list.

This is a problem. Because if the initial state says that t1 (a truck) is a package, that's impossible. So I think this must be a mistake, and the correct initial state should have the trucks and airplanes in those locations. So I'll proceed under the assumption that the problem statement has a typo, and the correct initial state is:

Truck t1 is in l1_5.

Truck t2 is in l2_5.

Airplane a1 is in l1_1.

Airplane a2 is in l2_1.

Packages p1 is in l1_4.

Package p2 is in l2_4.

Because otherwise, the problem is impossible. So I'll adjust accordingly.

Assuming that, let's proceed.

So, trucks t1 is in l1_5 (city c1), t2 in l2_5 (city c2). Airplanes a1 in l1_1 (c1's airport), a2 in l2_1 (c2's airport).

The goal is p1 in l2_4 (c2) and p2 in l1_5 (c1).

So, to move p1 from l1_4 (c1) to l2_4 (c2), we need to:

1. Use truck t1 in c1 to pick up p1 from l1_4.

But t1 is in l1_5. So first, drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_4 (same city c1). Then load p1 into t1. Then drive t1 to l1_1 (airport). Unload p1 at l1_1. Then load p1 onto airplane a1. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1. Unload p1 at l2_1. Then use truck t2 (in l2_5) to drive to l2_1, load p1, drive to l2_4, unload.

Wait, but t2 is in l2_5 (city c2). So to get t2 to l2_1, drive from l2_5 to l2_1 via drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2. Then load p1 into t2, drive to l2_4, unload.

But for p2 to get to l1_5 (c1), similar steps: move p2 from l2_4 to l2_1 via truck t2, load into airplane a2, fly to l1_1, unload, load into truck t1, drive to l1_5, unload.

But this is a basic plan. However, the constraints complicate things. Let's see.

Let's list all the constraints again, but numbered for clarity:

C1: p1 in l1_4 (already true in initial state, so satisfied)

C2: If C1 holds in any state s, then in s or after, p2 must be in l2_3 or l1_2. Since C1 is true in initial state, we need p2 to be in l2_3 or l1_2 at some point after.

C3: p1 in l2_3 and p2 in l1_4 at the same state.

C4: p2 in a1.

C5: p2 in l2_1.

C6: If p2 is in l2_1 (C5), then earlier state where p2 was in l2_5 or p1 in l2_2.

C7: p1 in l2_1.

C8: If p1 is in l2_1 (C7), then earlier state where p1 was in l2_3 or l1_5.

C9: p2 in l1_5 (this is the goal, but must also happen in some state before the end? No, the goal is the final state. So the final state satisfies this.

C10: If p2 is in l1_5 (which is the goal), then earlier state where p1 was in l2_2 or p2 in l1_4.

C11: p2 in l2_3.

C12: p1 in a2.

C13: p2 in l1_1.

C14: If p2 is in l1_1 (C13), then in that state or after, p1 in l2_2 or p2 in l1_4.

C15: p2 in l1_4.

This is a lot. Let's see how to satisfy these.

First, C3 requires that at some state, p1 is in l2_3 (c2) and p2 is in l1_4 (c1). So both packages are in different cities. How can this happen? Let's think.

p1 starts in l1_4. So to have p2 in l1_4, we need to move p2 from l2_4 to l1_4. But l1_4 is in c1. So p2 must be transported from c2 to c1. That would require using an airplane. So p2 would need to be driven to l2_1 (c2's airport), loaded onto a2, flown to l1_1 (c1's airport), unloaded, then driven to l1_4 via truck t1. But if we do that, then p2 would be in l1_4. But then, for C3, p1 needs to be in l2_3 at the same time.

Alternatively, perhaps during the transportation of p1 to c2, and p2 to c1, there's a point where p1 is in l2_3 and p2 is in l1_4.

Let's think step by step.

Let's outline the steps for moving p1 and p2.

Plan outline for p1:

1. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_4 (c1).

2. Load p1 into t1 at l1_4.

3. Drive t1 to l1_1 (airport).

4. Unload p1 at l1_1.

5. Load p1 into a1.

6. Fly a1 to l2_1 (c2's airport).

7. Unload p1 at l2_1.

8. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1.

9. Load p1 into t2.

10. Drive t2 to l2_4.

11. Unload p1 at l2_4.

For p2:

A. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_4.

B. Load p2 into t2 at l2_4.

C. Drive t2 to l2_1.

D. Unload p2 at l2_1.

E. Load p2 into a2.

F. Fly a2 to l1_1.

G. Unload p2 at l1_1.

H. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_1 (if needed).

Wait, t1 is initially at l1_5. After moving p1, t1 is at l1_1 (after step 3). Then after unloading p1 at l1_1 (step4), t1 is still at l1_1. So after step4, t1 is at l1_1. So for moving p2, after step G (unload p2 at l1_1), we can load p2 into t1, drive to l1_5, and unload.

But let's see the constraints.

But this plan outline may not satisfy all constraints. Let's check.

But first, let's see how to integrate the steps for p1 and p2. Because they need to be interleaved to meet the constraints.

Now, let's check the constraints:

C3: Need a state where p1 is in l2_3 and p2 is in l1_4.

But according to the plan outline, p1 is moved from l1_1 to l2_1 via airplane, then to l2_4. So p1 never goes to l2_3. So how to get p1 to l2_3?

Similarly, p2 is moved from l2_4 to l2_1 via truck, then flown to l1_1, then driven to l1_5. So p2 would be in l1_1 and then l1_5. So to get p2 to l1_4, we need a detour.

But C3 requires p2 to be in l1_4 at the same time as p1 is in l2_3. So perhaps during the transportation of p2 to l1_5, we can have p2 in l1_4.

For example, after unloading p2 at l1_1 (step G), load p2 into truck t1, drive to l1_4, unload (so p2 is in l1_4). Then drive to l1_5 and unload again. But this would add steps. But also, at the same time, p1 needs to be in l2_3.

So maybe during p1's transportation, after arriving at l2_1, instead of going directly to l2_4, we take a detour to l2_3.

So steps for p1:

7. Unload p1 at l2_1.

8. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1.

9. Load p1 into t2.

10. Drive t2 to l2_3.

11. Unload p1 at l2_3 (satisfies part of C3).

Then later, drive to l2_4.

But during that time, p2 is being moved. So if p2 is in l1_4 at the same time, then C3 is satisfied.

But how to get p2 to l1_4.

After p2 is unloaded at l1_1 (step G), load into t1, drive to l1_4, unload (so p2 is in l1_4). Then later, drive to l1_5 and unload.

So during the time when p1 is at l2_3 and p2 is at l1_4, C3 is satisfied.

But this requires additional steps. Let's see:

So for p2:

G. Unload p2 at l1_1.

H. Load p2 into t1.

I. Drive t1 to l1_4.

J. Unload p2 at l1_4. (Now p2 is in l1_4, satisfying C15 and part of C3.)

K. Load p2 into t1 again.

L. Drive t1 to l1_5.

M. Unload p2 at l1_5 (goal).

But during step J, p2 is in l1_4, which is C15. Also, C3 requires that at some state, p1 is in l2_3 and p2 in l1_4. So if p1 is in l2_3 (from step 11) and p2 is in l1_4 (step J), then this state occurs when both are true.

Now, let's check other constraints:

C12: p1 must be in a2. So a2 is in l2_1 (c2's airport). So to load p1 into a2, p1 must be in l2_1. But in the current plan, p1 is in l2_1 (after step7), then loaded into t2. So perhaps after unloading p1 at l2_1 (step7), we load p1 into a2 instead of t2. But then we need to fly a2 to somewhere. Wait, a2 is initially in l2_1. So if we load p1 into a2 in l2_1, then fly a2 to another airport, say l1_1, then unload. But this complicates the plan. But we need to have p1 in a2 at some point.

Alternatively, after p1 is in l2_1 (step7), we load it into a2, then unload it again. But why? Because C12 requires that p1 is in a2 in some state. So even if we load and unload immediately, that's acceptable. So:

7. Unload p1 at l2_1.

8. Load p1 into a2 (now p1 is in a2, satisfying C12).

9. Unload p1 from a2 (now back in l2_1).

10. Load into t2, drive to l2_3, etc.

But this adds steps but satisfies C12.

Similarly, C4: p2 must be in a1. a1 is in l1_1. So after p2 is unloaded at l1_1 (step G), load p2 into a1, then unload again. But a1 is in l1_1. So:

G. Unload p2 at l1_1.

H. Load p2 into a1 (satisfies C4).

I. Unload p2 from a1 back to l1_1.

Then proceed to load into t1.

But this adds steps but satisfies C4.

C5: p2 must be in l2_1. In the current plan, p2 is in l2_1 after step D (unload from t2). So that's satisfied.

C6: if p2 is in l2_1 (step D), then earlier state where p2 was in l2_5 or p1 in l2_2. Initially, p2 is in l2_4. So to get to l2_1, we drive from l2_4 to l2_1. But the initial position of t2 is l2_5. So to drive t2 to l2_4 to pick up p2, we need to move t2 from l2_5 to l2_4. So steps for p2:

A. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_4.

B. Load p2 into t2.

C. Drive t2 to l2_1.

D. Unload p2 in l2_1.

So, in this case, p2 was in l2_4 (initial) and moved to l2_1. But C6 requires that before p2 is in l2_1, there was a state where p2 was in l2_5 or p1 in l2_2. Since p2 was never in l2_5, and p1 was in l2_2? How can we get p1 to l2_2? l2_2 is in c2. So p1 would need to be driven there. But in the current plan, p1 is only moved to l2_1, then to l2_3, then to l2_4. So unless we take a detour.

Alternatively, maybe during the movement of p1, we take it through l2_2. For example, after unloading p1 at l2_1 (step7), load into t2, drive to l2_2, unload (so p1 is in l2_2), then later move to l2_3 and l2_4. This would satisfy the condition for C6, because when p2 is in l2_1 (step D), there's an earlier state where p1 was in l2_2.

So adding that step:

7. Unload p1 at l2_1.

8. Load p1 into t2.

9. Drive t2 to l2_2.

10. Unload p1 at l2_2. (Now p1 is in l2_2, satisfying C6's condition if needed.)

11. Load p1 into t2 again.

12. Drive to l2_3.

13. Unload p1 at l2_3.

But this complicates the plan but may be necessary for C6.

But C6 says that if p2 is in l2_1, there must be an earlier state where p2 was in l2_5 or p1 in l2_2. Since p2 starts in l2_4 and is moved to l2_1 via truck t2, the earlier state where p2 was in l2_5 doesn't happen. But if we have p1 in l2_2 before p2 is in l2_1, then C6 is satisfied. So in this case, if we have p1 in l2_2 before step D (p2 in l2_1), then it's okay.

But in the current plan, p1 is moved to l2_2 after being in l2_1. But the movement of p2 to l2_1 (step D) happens after p1 is moved to l2_2. Wait, no. Let's see the timing.

The steps for p1 and p2 are interleaved. Let's outline the entire plan step by step, considering all constraints.

This is getting complicated. Let's try to structure the plan step by step, ensuring all constraints are met.

Possible plan steps:

1. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_4 (c1). [To pick up p1.]

2. Loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4. [p1 is now in t1.]

3. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1. [Move t1 to airport.]

4. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1. [p1 is at l1_1.]

5. Loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1. [p1 in a1.]

6. Flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1. [a1 flies to c2's airport.]

7. Unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1. [p1 at l2_1.]

Now, p1 is at l2_1. This satisfies C7 (p1 in l2_1). Then, according to C8, there must be an earlier state where p1 was in l2_3 or l1_5. But p1 was in l1_5? No, p1 was in l1_4 initially. Wait, step7: p1 is in l2_1. So we need an earlier state where p1 was in l2_3 or l1_5. The only earlier states are steps 1-7. In those steps, p1 was in l1_4, l1_1, a1, then l2_1. So this violates C8. So this plan is invalid.

Therefore, we need to adjust the plan to ensure that before p1 is in l2_1, it was in l2_3 or l1_5. But l1_5 is where t1 was initially. So perhaps, after loading p1 into t1, drive to l1_5 instead of l1_1. But then how to get to the airport?

Wait, no. The airport is l1_1. So to fly p1 out, it needs to be at l1_1. So perhaps the route is:

After loading p1 into t1 at l1_4, drive to l1_5 (original location of t1), then back to l1_1. But that would add steps. For example:

1. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_4.

2. Load p1 into t1.

3. Drive t1 to l1_5. [Now p1 is in l1_5.]

4. Unload p1 at l1_5. [Now p1 is in l1_5.]

5. Load p1 into t1 again.

6. Drive t1 to l1_1.

7. Unload p1 at l1_1.

Then proceed as before. Now, when p1 is in l2_1 (step after flying), the earlier state where p1 was in l1_5 (step4) satisfies C8, because the condition is that if p1 is in l2_1, there must be an earlier state where p1 was in l2_3 or l1_5. So step4 satisfies that.

But this adds steps, making the plan longer. But we need to satisfy C8.

Similarly, other constraints may require detours.

Let's try to structure the plan considering all constraints.

First, handle C8: When p1 is in l2_1, there must be an earlier state where p1 was in l2_3 or l1_5.

Option: Have p1 in l1_5 before reaching l2_1.

So steps:

1. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_4.

2. Load p1 into t1.

3. Drive t1 to l1_5.

4. Unload p1 at l1_5. [Now p1 is in l1_5, which is part of C8's condition.]

5. Load p1 into t1 again.

6. Drive t1 to l1_1.

7. Unload p1 at l1_1.

8. Load into a1.

9. Fly to l2_1.

10. Unload p1 at l2_1. [Now, C7 is satisfied, and C8 is satisfied because step4 was earlier.]

Now, C7 and C8 are handled.

C7: p1 in l2_1 (step10).

C8: satisfied because step4 had p1 in l1_5.

Next, C12 requires p1 to be in a2. a2 is in l2_1. So after step10, p1 is in l2_1. We can load p1 into a2.

11. Loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1. [C12 satisfied.]

12. Unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1. [p1 is back in l2_1.]

Now, p1 needs to get to l2_4. So:

13. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1.

14. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1.

15. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2.

16. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4. [Goal for p1 achieved.]

Now, handle p2.

For p2, initial location l2_4.

To move to l1_5:

Need to get to c1's l1_5. So:

A. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_4. But wait, t2 is at l2_5 initially. After step13, t2 is driven to l2_1 (step13), then to l2_4 (step15). So after step16, t2 is at l2_4.

But for moving p2, perhaps use another truck. Wait, but there's only t2 in c2. So steps for p2:

A. After step16, t2 is at l2_4. Unload p1 (step16). Now, p2 is at l2_4.

B. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4.

C. Drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2.

D. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1. [Now p2 is in l2_1, satisfying C5.]

But according to C6, when p2 is in l2_1 (step D), there must be an earlier state where p2 was in l2_5 or p1 was in l2_2.

But p2 was never in l2_5. So we need p1 to be in l2_2 at some point before D.

In the current plan for p1, after step12 (p1 in l2_1), we load into t2 (step14), drive to l2_4. So p1 is in l2_4. But to have p1 in l2_2 before D (p2 in l2_1), we need to adjust the plan.

So perhaps after step12 (p1 in l2_1), instead of driving directly to l2_4, drive through l2_2.

So adjust steps for p1:

13. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1.

14. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1.

15. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2.

16. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2. [Now p1 is in l2_2.]

17. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2.

18. Drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2.

19. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4.

Now, in step16, p1 is in l2_2. Then steps for p2:

After step19, t2 is at l2_4. So:

A. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4.

B. Drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2.

C. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.

Now, when p2 is in l2_1 (step C), the earlier state where p1 was in l2_2 (step16) satisfies C6.

So C6 is satisfied.

Now, handle other constraints.

C11: p2 must be in l2_3. So during transportation, we need to have p2 in l2_3.

But how? p2 is moved from l2_4 to l2_1 via truck. To get to l2_3, we can take a detour.

Adjust steps for p2:

After step A (load p2 into t2 at l2_4):

B. Drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2.

C. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3. [Now p2 is in l2_3, satisfying C11.]

D. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3.

E. Drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2.

F. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.

Now, C11 is satisfied.

Now, C3 requires p1 in l2_3 and p2 in l1_4 at the same time. But currently, p2 is in l2_3 (step C), but p1 is in l2_2 (step16). Not sure. Let's see the timing.

Wait, the steps are interleaved. Let's outline the entire plan with all steps:

Plan steps for p1:

1. Drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1.

2. Loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4.

3. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1.

4. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5.

5. Loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5.

6. Drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1.

7. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1.

8. Loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1.

9. Flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1.

10. Unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1.

11. Loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1. [C12 satisfied.]

12. Unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1.

13. Drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2.

14. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1.

15. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2.

16. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2.

17. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2.

18. Drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2.

19. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4. [Goal for p1.]

Plan steps for p2:

20. After step19, t2 is at l2_4.

21. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4.

22. Drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2.

23. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3. [C11 satisfied.]

24. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3.

25. Drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2.

26. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1. [C5 satisfied.]

27. Loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1.

28. Flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

29. Unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1. [C13: p2 in l1_1.]

But C14 says if p2 is in l1_1, then in that state or after, p1 is in l2_2 or p2 in l1_4. At step29, p2 is in l1_1. So we need to ensure that after this, either p1 is in l2_2 or p2 is in l1_4.

In the current plan, after step29, p2 is unloaded at l1_1. To satisfy C14, we need to either have p1 in l2_2 (which was step16, but that's before step29) or p2 in l1_4 after step29.

So perhaps after step29, move p2 to l1_4.

30. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1. [Assuming t1 is at l1_1.]

But after step6, t1 was driven to l1_1 (step6). Then unloaded in step7. So t1 is at l1_1. So:

30. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

31. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1.

32. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4. [C15 satisfied and part of C3.]

Now, p2 is in l1_4. So after step32, C15 is satisfied. Also, C3 requires that at some state, p1 is in l2_3 and p2 in l1_4. But in this plan, p1 is in l2_3 during step23? No, p1 is in l2_4 at step19. Wait, no. p1 is moved to l2_3 via steps not in the current plan. Oh wait, no. The steps for p1 do not include l2_3. So C3 requires both p1 in l2_3 and p2 in l1_4. But in the current plan, p1 is never in l2_3. So this is a problem.

So to satisfy C3, we need to have p1 in l2_3 and p2 in l1_4 at the same time. So perhaps during p1's transportation, we have a detour to l2_3.

Adjust the p1 steps after step12:

13. Drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2.

14. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1.

15. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2.

16. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3. [Now p1 is in l2_3.]

17. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3.

18. Drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2.

19. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4.

Now, during p2's steps, when p2 is in l1_4 (step32), if p1 is in l2_3 during step16, then C3 is satisfied if these steps overlap.

But in this case, p1 is in l2_3 at step16 (unloaded), then loaded again. So during step16 (unload), p1 is in l2_3. But p2 is in l1_4 after step32. The timing is such that step16 occurs before step32. So at step16, p2 is not yet in l1_4. So they are not in those locations at the same time.

So this approach doesn't satisfy C3. We need to find a way to have both p1 in l2_3 and p2 in l1_4 at the same time.

Alternative approach: Have p2 in l1_4 while p1 is in l2_3.

For example, after p2 is unloaded at l1_4 (step32), p1 is moved to l2_3 before being delivered to l2_4.

But how?

Perhaps after p1 is unloaded at l2_3 (step16), then p2 is moved to l1_4 (step32). But during that time, p1 is in l2_3, and p2 is in l1_4. So the state after step32 would have p1 in l2_3 and p2 in l1_4. But after step32, p1 is still in l2_3 until step17.

So steps:

After step16 (p1 in l2_3), proceed with p2's steps to l1_4 (step32). Then, continue with p1's steps to l2_4.

So the sequence would be:

p1 steps up to step16 (unload at l2_3).

p2 steps up to step32 (unload at l1_4).

Then, p1 is loaded again and moved to l2_4.

At the state after step32, both p1 is in l2_3 and p2 in l1_4, satisfying C3.

Now, let's outline this:

Plan for p1:

... steps 1-16: p1 unloaded at l2_3.

17. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3.

18. Drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2.

19. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4.

Plan for p2:

... steps 20-32: p2 unloaded at l1_4.

Then, p2 is driven to l1_5.

33. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4.

34. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1.

35. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5. [Goal for p2.]

Now, after step32 (p2 in l1_4) and step16 (p1 in l2_3), both are true, satisfying C3.

Now, let's check other constraints:

C4: p2 must be in a1. a1 is in l1_1. So during p2's transportation, after being unloaded at l1_1 (step29), load into a1.

But step29: p2 is unloaded at l1_1.

30. Loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1. [C4 satisfied.]

31. Unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1.

32. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

33. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1.

34. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4.

35. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4.

36. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1.

37. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5.

But this adds steps but satisfies C4.

C13: p2 must be in l1_1. Satisfied at step29.

C14: if p2 is in l1_1 (step29), then in that state or after, p1 in l2_2 or p2 in l1_4. At step34, p2 is in l1_4, so this is satisfied.

C10: if p2 is in l1_5 (goal), then earlier state where p1 in l2_2 or p2 in l1_4. p2 in l1_4 at step34, which is before the goal, so satisfied.

C2: if p1 is in l1_4 (initial state), then p2 must be in l2_3 or l1_2 at or after. In the plan, p2 is in l2_3 at step23, which is after the initial state.

C9: p2 in l1_5 (goal).

C7: p1 in l2_1 (step10).

C8: satisfied because p1 was in l1_5 (step4) before l2_1.

C12: p1 in a2 (step11).

C5: p2 in l2_1 (step26).

C6: satisfied because p1 was in l2_2 (step16) before p2 is in l2_1 (step26 is after step16).

C11: p2 in l2_3 (step23).

C15: p2 in l1_4 (step34).

C3: p1 in l2_3 (step16) and p2 in l1_4 (step34) at the same state? No, because step16 occurs before step34. But in the state after step34, p2 is in l1_4 and p1 is in l2_3 (if step16 is before step34). Wait, no. Let's see the order of steps:

The steps are sequential. So after p1 is in l2_3 (step16), then p1 is loaded and moved to l2_4 (steps17-19). Then p2's steps continue. So when p2 is in l1_4 (step34), p1 is already in l2_4. So C3 is not satisfied.

This is a problem. So how to have both p1 and p2 in the required locations simultaneously?

Maybe we need to interleave the steps differently.

Let's try:

After p1 is in l2_3 (step16), instead of immediately moving to l2_4, we pause and handle p2's transportation to l1_4.

So:

p1 steps:

16. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3. [C3 part 1.]

Then proceed with p2's steps to get to l1_4.

p2 steps:

At this point, p2 is in l2_1 (step26).

27. Loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1.

28. Flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

29. Unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1. [C13.]

30. Loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1. [C4.]

31. Unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1.

32. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

33. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1.

34. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4. [C3 part 2 and C15.]

At this state, p1 is in l2_3 (step16) and p2 is in l1_4 (step34). So C3 is satisfied.

Then continue moving p1 to l2_4:

35. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3.

36. Drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2.

37. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4. [p1 goal.]

Finally, move p2 to l1_5:

38. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4.

39. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1.

40. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5. [p2 goal.]

This way, after step34, both p1 in l2_3 and p2 in l1_4 are true, satisfying C3.

Now, checking all constraints:

C1: p1 in l1_4 initially, satisfied.

C2: after initial state, p2 is in l2_3 at step23, satisfied.

C3: step34 and step16 occur in sequence, but in the state after step34, p1 is still in l2_3 (wait, no. After step16, p1 is unloaded at l2_3. Then step35 loads p1 back into t2. So during step34 (p2 unloaded at l1_4), p1 is in t2 (if step35 has already happened). So maybe not.

Wait, the steps are sequential. After step16 (p1 unloaded at l2_3), step17 (load p1 into t2) and step18 (drive to l2_4) would occur. But we paused p1's steps after step16 to handle p2's steps up to step34. So:

p1's steps:

16. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3. [C3 part1, p1 in l2_3.]

Then proceed with p2's steps up to step34 (p2 in l1_4).

Then, resume p1's steps:

35. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3.

36. Drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2.

37. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4.

So between step16 and 35, p1 is in l2_3. During that time, p2 is moved to l1_4 (step34). So at step34, p1 is still in l2_3 (since step35 hasn't happened yet). So the state after step34 has p1 in l2_3 and p2 in l1_4, satisfying C3.

Yes, that works.

Now, let's check all constraints again:

C1: Initial state.

C2: p2 in l2_3 at step23.

C3: After step34, both conditions met.

C4: p2 in a1 at step30.

C5: p2 in l2_1 at step26.

C6: p2 in l2_1 at step26, with p1 in l2_3 (step16) which happened earlier.

C7: p1 in l2_1 at step10.

C8: p1 in l1_5 at step4 before l2_1.

C9: p2 in l1_5 at step40.

C10: p2 in l1_5 (step40), earlier state has p2 in l1_4 (step34).

C11: p2 in l2_3 at step23.

C12: p1 in a2 at step11.

C13: p2 in l1_1 at step29.

C14: p2 in l1_1 (step29), then p2 is in l1_4 (step34) after.

C15: p2 in l1_4 at step34.

All constraints are satisfied.

Now, let's write out the full plan in order, interleaving steps for p1 and p2.

Full plan steps:

1. Drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1.

2. Loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4.

3. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1.

4. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5.

5. Loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5.

6. Drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1.

7. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1.

8. Loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1.

9. Flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1.

10. Unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1.

11. Loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1. [C12]

12. Unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1.

13. Drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2.

14. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1.

15. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2.

16. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3. [C3 part1]

17. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4. [Assuming p2 is still in l2_4? Wait, initial state says p2 is in l2_4. But earlier steps for p2 haven't been taken yet. So need to adjust.]

Wait, in the current plan, we have to handle p2's movement as well. Let me redo the full plan with both packages' steps interleaved.

It's getting quite involved, but let's try to list all steps in order:

Steps for p1:

1. Drive t1 to l1_4, load p1, drive to l1_5, unload.

2. Drive t1 to l1_1, unload p1.

3. Load p1 into a1, fly to l2_1.

4. Unload p1, load into a2 (C12), unload.

5. Load into t2, drive to l2_3, unload (C3 part1).

6. Then drive to l2_4.

Steps for p2:

A. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_4, load p2.

B. Drive to l2_3, unload (C11).

C. Drive to l2_1, unload (C5).

D. Load into a2, fly to l1_1, unload (C13).

E. Load into a1 (C4), unload.

F. Load into t1, drive to l1_4 (C3 part2 and C15), unload.

G. Drive to l1_5, unload (goal).

Interleaving these steps properly:

Let's see:

1. Drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1.

2. Loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4.

3. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1.

4. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5.

5. Loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5.

6. Drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1.

7. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1.

8. Loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1.

9. Flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1.

10. Unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1.

11. Loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1. (C12)

12. Unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1.

13. Drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2. (to load p2)

14. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4.

15. Drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2. (C11)

16. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3.

17. Drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2. (to reach airport)

18. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1. (C5)

19. Loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1.

20. Flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

21. Unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1. (C13)

22. Loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1. (C4)

23. Unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1.

24. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

25. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1.

26. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4. (C15 and part of C3)

27. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1. (Wait, p1 is at l2_1 from step12.)

Wait, after step12, p1 is at l2_1. Then step13 is driving t2 to l2_4. But step13 is after step12.

Hmm, this is getting too tangled. Let's try to reorganize the steps properly.

Final plan steps in order:

1. Drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1. [Move t1 to p1's location.]

2. Loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4. [Pick up p1.]

3. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1. [Move back to l1_5.]

4. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5. [Leave p1 at l1_5.]

5. Loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5. [Reload to move to airport.]

6. Drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1. [To airport.]

7. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1. [p1 at airport.]

8. Loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1. [Load into a1.]

9. Flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1. [Fly to c2's airport.]

10. Unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1. [p1 in l2_1.]

11. Loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1. [C12: p1 in a2.]

12. Unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1. [p1 back in l2_1.]

13. Drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2. [Move t2 to p2's location.]

14. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4. [Pick up p2.]

15. Drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2. [Move to l2_3.]

16. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3. [C11: p2 in l2_3.]

17. Drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2. [Move to airport.]

18. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1. [C5: p2 in l2_1.]

19. Loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1. [Load into a2.]

20. Flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1. [Fly to c1's airport.]

21. Unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1. [C13: p2 in l1_1.]

22. Loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1. [C4: p2 in a1.]

23. Unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1. [Back in l1_1.]

24. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1. [Load into t1.]

25. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1. [Move to l1_4.]

26. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4. [C15 and part of C3.]

27. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2. [Move t2 to l2_3.]

28. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3. [Assuming p1 is at l2_1? No, p1 is at l2_1 from step12. So need to load into t2.]

Wait, after step12, p1 is in l2_1. To move p1 to l2_3:

29. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1.

30. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2.

31. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3. [C3 part1.]

Now, after step31, p1 is in l2_3 and p2 is in l1_4 (step26). So C3 is satisfied.

Then, move p1 to l2_4:

32. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3.

33. Drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2.

34. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4. [Goal for p1.]

Finally, move p2 to l1_5:

35. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4.

36. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1.

37. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5. [Goal for p2.]

Now, all constraints are satisfied.

This plan has 37 steps, which is quite long. But due to the numerous constraints, it's necessary to include these steps. However, there might be a more optimal path with fewer steps. But given the time constraints, this seems to cover all the requirements.
