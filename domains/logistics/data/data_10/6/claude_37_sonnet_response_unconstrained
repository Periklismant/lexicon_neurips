Let me analyze the problem. We have two cities (c1 and c2), each with five locations (l1_1 through l1_5 for c1, and l2_1 through l2_5 for c2). We have two trucks (t1 and t2) and two airplanes (a1 and a2). We have two packages (p1 and p2).

Initial state:
- p1 is in location l1_4 (in city c1)
- p2 is in location l2_4 (in city c2)
- t1 is in location l1_5 (in city c1)
- t2 is in location l2_5 (in city c2)
- a1 is in location l1_1 (in city c1, which is an airport)
- a2 is in location l2_1 (in city c2, which is an airport)

Goal:
- p1 should be in location l2_4 (in city c2)
- p2 should be in location l1_5 (in city c1)

Essentially, we need to swap the locations of the two packages. 

Let's create a high-level plan first:
1. Use t1 to transport p1 from l1_4 to the airport l1_1
2. Use a1 to transport p1 from l1_1 to the airport l2_1 in city c2
3. Use t2 to transport p1 from l2_1 to l2_4
4. Use t2 to transport p2 from l2_4 to the airport l2_1
5. Use a2 to transport p2 from l2_1 to the airport l1_1 in city c1
6. Use t1 to transport p2 from l1_1 to l1_5

Let's work out the detailed actions:

1. Use t1 to transport p1 from l1_4 to the airport l1_1
   - drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1 (move t1 from l1_5 to l1_4)
   - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4 (load p1 into t1 at l1_4)
   - drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 (move t1 with p1 to the airport l1_1)
   - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (unload p1 from t1 at l1_1)

2. Use a1 to transport p1 from l1_1 to the airport l2_1 in city c2
   - loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (load p1 into a1 at l1_1)
   - flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (fly a1 with p1 from l1_1 to l2_1)
   - unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 (unload p1 from a1 at l2_1)

3. Use t2 to transport p1 from l2_1 to l2_4
   - drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 (move t2 from l2_5 to l2_1)
   - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (load p1 into t2 at l2_1)
   - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2 (move t2 with p1 to l2_4)
   - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (unload p1 from t2 at l2_4)

4. Use t2 to transport p2 from l2_4 to the airport l2_1
   - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (load p2 into t2 at l2_4)
   - drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2 (move t2 with p2 to the airport l2_1)
   - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (unload p2 from t2 at l2_1)

5. Use a2 to transport p2 from l2_1 to the airport l1_1 in city c1
   - loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (load p2 into a2 at l2_1)
   - flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (fly a2 with p2 from l2_1 to l1_1)
   - unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (unload p2 from a2 at l1_1)

6. Use t1 to transport p2 from l1_1 to l1_5
   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (load p2 into t1 at l1_1)
   - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1 (move t1 with p2 to l1_5)
   - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 (unload p2 from t1 at l1_5)

This should fulfill the goal of having p1 in l2_4 and p2 in l1_5.

Wait, I realized there's an issue in the initial state given. It says "Package t1 is in location l1_5" and "Package t2 is in location l2_5", but t1 and t2 are trucks, not packages. Similarly, it says "Package a1 is in location l1_1" and "Package a2 is in location l2_1", but a1 and a2 are airplanes, not packages. 

Let me assume that the intended meaning is:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_5
- Truck t2 is in location l2_5
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

With this clarification, the plan outlined above should still be valid.

Let me review the plan one more time:

1. Drive truck t1 from l1_5 to l1_4
2. Load package p1 into truck t1 at l1_4
3. Drive truck t1 from l1_4 to l1_1
4. Unload package p1 from truck t1 at l1_1
5. Load package p1 into airplane a1 at l1_1
6. Fly airplane a1 from l1_1 to l2_1
7. Unload package p1 from airplane a1 at l2_1
8. Drive truck t2 from l2_5 to l2_1
9. Load package p1 into truck t2 at l2_1
10. Drive truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_4
11. Unload package p1 from truck t2 at l2_4
12. Load package p2 into truck t2 at l2_4
13. Drive truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_1
14. Unload package p2 from truck t2 at l2_1
15. Load package p2 into airplane a2 at l2_1
16. Fly airplane a2 from l2_1 to l1_1
17. Unload package p2 from airplane a2 at l1_1
18. Load package p2 into truck t1 at l1_1
19. Drive truck t1 from l1_1 to l1_5
20. Unload package p2 from truck t1 at l1_5

This plan should achieve the goal of having p1 in l2_4 and p2 in l1_5. Let's double-check:

- p1 starts in l1_4, gets transported to l1_1, then to l2_1, and finally to l2_4, which is the goal location for p1.
- p2 starts in l2_4, gets transported to l2_1, then to l1_1, and finally to l1_5, which is the goal location for p2.

But wait, I notice that we can optimize this plan:
- For step 18, we need to have t1 at l1_1. But after step 4, t1 is already at l1_1, and we don't need t1 until step 18. So, we could potentially save some steps by keeping t1 at l1_1 and not moving it elsewhere.
- Similarly, for step 12, we need to have t2 at l2_4. But after step 11, t2 is already at l2_4, and there's no need to move it elsewhere.

But actually, now that I check the plan again, it doesn't need optimization. The plan is already optimal given the initial positions of the trucks and the goal positions of the packages.

For clarity, let me restate the optimal plan using the exact format required:

```
drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
```

Hmm, let me check again if we can optimize further. Actually, we can parallelize some actions, but I believe the problem is asking for a sequential plan.

Actually, I think there's an error in my loadairplane and unloadairplane actions. According to the problem statement:

- "loadairplane p ap l": Load package p in airplane ap. Both p and ap are in location l.
- "loadairplane p ap l": Unload package p from airplane ap in location l.

It seems the second loadairplane definition is actually for unloadairplane. Let's adjust the plan:

```
drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
```

This plan should be correct. It's actually the same as before, but I just noted the discrepancy in the task's definition.

Now, let me verify once more that all the actions in the plan are valid:

1. `drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1`: Valid because t1 is in l1_5, and both l1_5 and l1_4 are in city c1.
2. `loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4`: Valid because after the previous action, t1 is in l1_4 and p1 is in l1_4.
3. `drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1`: Valid because after the previous actions, t1 is in l1_4, and both l1_4 and l1_1 are in city c1.
4. `unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1`: Valid because after the previous actions, t1 is in l1_1 and p1 is in t1.
5. `loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1`: Valid because after the previous actions, p1 is in l1_1 and a1 is in l1_1.
6. `flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1`: Valid because after the previous actions, a1 is in l1_1.
7. `unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1`: Valid because after the previous actions, a1 is in l2_1 and p1 is in a1.
8. `drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2`: Valid because t2 is in l2_5, and both l2_5 and l2_1 are in city c2.
9. `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1`: Valid because after the previous actions, p1 is in l2_1 and t2 is in l2_1.
10. `drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2`: Valid because after the previous actions, t2 is in l2_1, and both l2_1 and l2_4 are in city c2.
11. `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4`: Valid because after the previous actions, t2 is in l2_4 and p1 is in t2.
12. `loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4`: Valid because after the previous actions, p2 is in l2_4 and t2 is in l2_4.
13. `drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2`: Valid because after the previous actions, t2 is in l2_4, and both l2_4 and l2_1 are in city c2.
14. `unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1`: Valid because after the previous actions, t2 is in l2_1 and p2 is in t2.
15. `loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1`: Valid because after the previous actions, p2 is in l2_1 and a2 is in l2_1.
16. `flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1`: Valid because after the previous actions, a2 is in l2_1.
17. `unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1`: Valid because after the previous actions, a2 is in l1_1 and p2 is in a2.
18. `loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1`: Valid because after the previous actions, p2 is in l1_1 and t1 is in l1_1 (from step 4, and t1 hasn't moved since).
19. `drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1`: Valid because after the previous actions, t1 is in l1_1, and both l1_1 and l1_5 are in city c1.
20. `unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5`: Valid because after the previous actions, t1 is in l1_5 and p2 is in t1.

All actions are valid, and the plan achieves the goal. Thus, the optimal plan is:

```
drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
```

This plan should be the optimal solution for the given problem.

Actually, I'm noticing a discrepency in the action names and their descriptions. Let me double-check:

- "loadtruck p t l": Load package p in truck t. Both p and t are in location l.
- "loadairplane p ap l": Load package p in airplane ap. Both p and ap are in location l.
- "unloadtruck p t l": Unload package p from truck t in location l.
- "loadairplane p ap l": Unload package p from airplane ap in location l.

The last one should be "unloadairplane p ap l", not "loadairplane p ap l". I think this is a typo in the problem statement. But for clarity, I'll rewrite the correct actions:

```
drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
```

One thing I notice is that the problem says the delineate the plan with one top line and one bottom line containing only 3  '`' characters. So the format should be:

```
```
drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
```
```

Actually, I see one more optimization opportunity. After we drove truck t1 to the airport l1_1 and unloaded p1 from it, the truck is still at the airport. Instead of using a1 to transport p1 to l2_1, we can use a1 to transport p2 from l1_1 to l2_1. This would save steps.

But wait, p2 is not at l1_1 at this point; it's still at l2_4. So we can't do that optimization. Let me double-check if there are any other optimizations:

I notice one more thing: after we move p1 from l1_4 to l2_4, the truck t2 is still at l2_4 with p2. So, it makes sense to continue with p2 from there.

Actually, I think the plan is already optimal. We need to get p1 from l1_4 to l2_4 and p2 from l2_4 to l1_5. The only way to transport packages between cities is using airplanes, which can only land and take off from airports. So, we need to:
1. Use a truck to take p1 from l1_4 to the airport l1_1
2. Use an airplane to take p1 from l1_1 to l2_1
3. Use a truck to take p1 from l2_1 to l2_4
4. Use a truck to take p2 from l2_4 to the airport l2_1
5. Use an airplane to take p2 from l2_1 to l1_1
6. Use a truck to take p2 from l1_1 to l1_5

This matches the plan I've described.

In fact, the plan we've created is 20 steps in total, which seems to be the minimal number of steps required to accomplish the goal. So, I believe the plan is optimal.

Let me restate the plan:

```
drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
```
