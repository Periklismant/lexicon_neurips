Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. So, the goal is to get package p1 to l2_4 and p2 to l1_5. Let's start by understanding the initial state and the available actions.

First, let's note the initial positions. Both p1 and p2 are in their respective cities. p1 is in l1_4 (city c1), and p2 is in l2_4 (city c2). The trucks t1 and t2 are in l1_5 and l2_5, respectively. The airplanes a1 and a2 are at airports l1_1 and l2_1.

The target is to swap their locations: p1 needs to go to l2_4, which is in city c2, and p2 to l1_5 in c1. Since cities are connected by airplanes, we'll probably need to use airplanes to transport between cities. Trucks can move within the same city.

Let's break down the steps for each package.

Starting with p1: It's in l1_4 (c1). To get to l2_4 (c2), we need to first move it to an airport in c1, then load it onto an airplane, fly to c2's airport, unload, and then transport it via truck to l2_4.

Similarly, p2 is in l2_4 (c2). It needs to go to l1_5 (c1). So, move it to c2's airport, fly to c1's airport, then truck to l1_5.

But wait, the trucks are initially at l1_5 and l2_5. Let's check where the trucks are. t1 is in l1_5 (c1), t2 in l2_5 (c2). So, for p1 in c1, we need a truck to pick it up from l1_4. But t1 is in l1_5. So, we need to drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_4. Then load p1 into t1, drive back to the airport (assuming the airport in c1 is l1_1). Wait, the airport in c1 is l1_1. So, the truck would have to go from l1_4 to l1_1. Wait, but can the truck move between any locations in the city? Yes, as long as they are in the same city. So, l1_1 is in c1, so t1 can drive from l1_5 to l1_4 (same city), then to l1_1? Let me check the city structure. The initial state lists l1_1 to l1_5 as part of c1. So, all those locations are in c1, so the truck can drive between them.

Wait, the original state says "Location l1_1 is in city c1", and similarly for l1_2, l1_3, etc. So, in c1, the locations are l1_1 (airport), l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5. So, the truck t1 is at l1_5. To pick up p1 at l1_4, the truck needs to drive from l1_5 to l1_4. Then load p1 into t1. Then drive to the airport l1_1. Then unload p1 at l1_1, load it onto airplane a1 (which is already at l1_1). Then fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1 (c2's airport). Then unload p1 from a1 at l2_1. Then use truck t2 (which is in l2_5) to drive to l2_1? Wait, t2 is in l2_5 (city c2). So, to get to the airport l2_1, which is in c2, t2 can drive from l2_5 to l2_1. Then load p1 into t2, drive to l2_4 and unload. Similarly for p2.

But wait, for p2: it's in l2_4. Need to get it to l1_5. So, use truck t2 (initially at l2_5) to drive to l2_4, load p2, drive to airport l2_1, load onto a2, fly to l1_1, unload, then use truck t1 (now perhaps back in l1_5?) to drive to l1_1, load p2, drive to l1_5 and unload.

Wait, but after moving p1, what's the state of the trucks and airplanes? Let's outline the steps.

For p1:

1. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_4 (c1). Now t1 is at l1_4.
2. Load p1 into t1 at l1_4.
3. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1 (airport in c1).
4. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1. Now p1 is at l1_1.
5. Load p1 into airplane a1 (which is at l1_1).
6. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1 (c2's airport).
7. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1. Now p1 is at l2_1.
8. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (c2). But wait, t2 is in l2_5. So drive to l2_1 via possible locations. Are l2_5 and l2_1 connected? Since they are in the same city, the truck can drive directly? The drivetruck action allows moving between any two locations in the same city. So t2 can drive from l2_5 to l2_1 directly.
9. Load p1 into t2 at l2_1.
10. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4 (since l2_4 is in c2).
11. Unload p1 at l2_4. Done.

For p2:

1. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_4 (c2). Wait, but in the steps above for p1, t2 would have moved to l2_1 and then to l2_4. Wait, but in the initial state, t2 is in l2_5. So maybe we need to handle p2 first? Let me think. If we do p1 first, t2 would be moving to l2_1 and then to l2_4, which is where p2 is. But p2 is in l2_4. Wait, but after moving p1 to l2_4, we might have to handle p2. Let's see.

Wait, but when we start, p2 is in l2_4. So to move p2 to l1_5, we need to:

1. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_4 (c2). But t2 is in l2_5 initially. So first, drive t2 to l2_4, load p2, then drive to airport l2_1, load onto a2, fly to l1_1, unload, then use t1 to take it to l1_5.

But the problem is that if we process p1 first, t2 may end up in l2_4, which is where p2 is. But perhaps the order of handling the packages can be optimized.

Alternatively, process both packages in parallel. Let me see.

But let's outline both paths.

But perhaps the optimal plan would be to handle both packages in a way that minimizes steps. Let's see.

Wait, the problem requires that the plan is optimal, i.e., the shortest possible. So we need to see if there's a way to interleave the steps for p1 and p2 to save actions.

Alternatively, maybe handle p1 first, then p2, but check if any steps can be shared.

Let's first try to plan for p1:

Steps for p1:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
3. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
5. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
6. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
7. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
8. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
9. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
10. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
11. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

Then for p2:

12. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2 (but after step 10, t2 is at l2_4, so to load p2, need to drive from l2_4 to l2_4? Wait, no. Wait, p2 is in l2_4. So after step 11, p1 is at l2_4, but p2 is still there. Wait, no. Wait, the initial position of p2 is l2_4. So when we start, p2 is at l2_4, and in the process of moving p1, we might have moved t2 to l2_1, then to l2_4. So after step 10, t2 is at l2_4. Then, after unloading p1 at l2_4 (step 11), t2 is still at l2_4. So to move p2, which is at l2_4, we can load it into t2 right there.

Wait, after step 11, t2 is at l2_4 (since step 10 drove t2 to l2_4). So step 11 is unloading p1 there. Then, for p2:

12. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
13. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
14. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
15. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
16. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
17. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
18. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1 (since t1 is at l1_1 after step 3. Wait, step 3: t1 is driven from l1_4 to l1_1. Then steps 4-5: unload and load into airplane. Then t1 is still at l1_1. So after all the steps for p1, t1 is at l1_1. So for p2, after flying to l1_1, we need to drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_5 to unload p2 there.

But wait, step 18: drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
Then, unload p2:

19. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (after unloading from airplane)
Wait, let's retrace.

After p2 arrives at l1_1 via airplane a2. Then, we need to get it to l1_5. So:

17. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (after flying a2 to l1_1)
18. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (t1 is at l1_1)
19. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
20. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

So total steps for p2 would be steps 12-20. But combining with p1's steps, total steps would be 20. But maybe we can interleave.

Alternatively, perhaps while the airplane is flying, other actions can be done. For example, after flying a1 to l2_1 (step 6), maybe start moving t2 towards l2_1 in parallel. Wait, but the problem requires a sequence of actions, not parallel. So the plan has to be linear.

Alternatively, maybe after moving p1 to l2_4, we can use the same airplane a1 to carry p2 back? Wait, but p2 needs to go from c2 to c1. So a2 is at l2_1 initially, so perhaps use a2 to carry p2.

Wait, initial positions:

Airplanes: a1 is at l1_1, a2 at l2_1.

So for p2: need to get from l2_4 (c2) to l1_5 (c1). So:

- Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_4 (c2) to pick up p2. Then drive to l2_1 (airport), load into a2, fly to l1_1, unload, then drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_5.

But if we can interleave the steps for p1 and p2, maybe save some actions.

But maybe the optimal plan is 16 steps. Let me think.

Alternatively, let's see:

Plan for p1:

1. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_4 (c1)
2. Load p1 into t1 at l1_4
3. Drive t1 to l1_1 (airport)
4. Unload p1 at l1_1
5. Load p1 into a1
6. Fly a1 to l2_1
7. Unload p1 from a1
8. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (c2)
9. Load p1 into t2
10. Drive t2 to l2_4
11. Unload p1 at l2_4

For p2:

12. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_5? Wait, after step 10, t2 is at l2_4. So after step 11, t2 is still at l2_4. To get p2, which is at l2_4, load it into t2 there.

12. Load p2 into t2 at l2_4
13. Drive t2 to l2_1 (airport)
14. Unload p2 at l2_1
15. Load p2 into a2
16. Fly a2 to l1_1
17. Unload p2 from a2
18. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_5 (since t1 is at l1_1 after step 3)
19. Load p2 into t1 at l1_5? Wait, no, t1 is at l1_5 after step 18. Wait, after step 3, t1 was driven to l1_1. Then, after step 18, we drive it back to l1_5. But when we unload p2 at l1_1 (step 17), we need to load it into t1, which is at l1_1. Wait, no. After step 3, t1 is at l1_1. Then in step 18, driving t1 back to l1_5. So after step 18, t1 is at l1_5. Then, p2 is at l1_1 (from step 17). So to get p2 to l1_5, we need to drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_1, load p2, then drive back. That adds steps. Hmm.

Wait, let's retrace:

After step 3, t1 is at l1_1. Then steps 4-11 are for p1. Then, after step 11, t2 is at l2_4. So for p2:

At step 12: loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (p2 is here, t2 is here)
Step 13: drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
Step 14: unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
Step 15: loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (a2 is at l2_1)
Step 16: flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
Step 17: unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (now p2 is at l1_1)
Now, to get p2 to l1_5: need to use a truck. But t1 is at l1_1 (from step 3). Wait, after step 3, t1 was driven to l1_1. But after step 4, unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1, so t1 is still at l1_1. Then, after step 18 (which would be step 18 in the combined plan), drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_5. Wait, but we can do that after step 17.

So steps 18: drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
19: loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5? Wait, no, p2 is at l1_1. So after step 17, p2 is at l1_1. But t1 is at l1_1 (from step 3) until step 18. So before step 18, we can load p2 into t1.

Wait, after step 17, p2 is at l1_1. So step 18: loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (t1 is at l1_1)
Step 19: drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
Step 20: unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

But that adds steps. So total steps would be 20.

But maybe there's a better way. Let's think. What if we use the same truck for both packages in their respective cities?

Alternatively, after moving p1 to l2_4, use the same airplane a1 to fly back to c1 to carry p2. But a1 is at l2_1 after step 6. So to fly back, but p2 is in c2. So maybe not.

Alternatively, after flying a1 to l2_1, can we fly it back? But the package p2 is in c2. So perhaps use a2 to fly to c1. Let's see.

Let me think again. The airplanes are a1 (initial at l1_1) and a2 (initial at l2_1). So for p2, which is in l2_4 (c2), we need to get it to l1_5 (c1). So:

- Use truck t2 to pick up p2 from l2_4, drive to l2_1 (airport), load into a2, fly to l1_1, unload, then use truck t1 (which is at l1_1) to drive to l1_5 and unload.

But in the initial state, t1 is at l1_5. Wait, no, initial state says "Package t1 is in location l1_5". Wait, wait, the original state says:

Original state:

"Package t1 is in location l1_5"

Wait, but t1 is a truck. Wait, the problem statement lists "truck t1" as an object, so the initial position of t1 is l1_5. Similarly for t2 at l2_5.

So t1 is initially at l1_5. So for p1:

1. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_4 (c1)
2. Load p1 into t1 at l1_4
3. Drive t1 to l1_1 (airport)
4. Unload p1 there
5. Load into a1
6. Fly a1 to l2_1
7. Unload p1
8. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (c2)
9. Load p1 into t2
10. Drive to l2_4
11. Unload p1

Then for p2:

12. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_4? No, t2 is at l2_4 after step 10. So p2 is at l2_4. So:

12. Load p2 into t2 at l2_4
13. Drive t2 to l2_1
14. Unload p2 at l2_1
15. Load into a2
16. Fly a2 to l1_1
17. Unload p2 at l1_1
18. Drive t1 from l1_1 (after step 3, t1 was at l1_1, then unloaded. But after step 3, t1 was driven to l1_1 and left there. So after step 3, t1 is at l1_1. Then in step 4, we unload p1, but t1 remains there. So after step 17, p2 is at l1_1, and t1 is at l1_1. So:

18. Load p2 into t1 at l1_1
19. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_5
20. Unload p2 at l1_5

So total steps would be 20. But maybe there's a way to optimize this.

Wait, after step 19 (driving t1 to l1_5), we can unload p2 there. So steps are 20.

But is there a way to reduce this? Let's see.

Alternative approach: after step 11 (p1 is at l2_4), the airplane a1 is at l2_1. For p2, we need to use a2 (which is at l2_1 initially). Wait, no. a2 is at l2_1 in the initial state. So for p2:

- Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_4 (c2). Load p2 into t2, drive to l2_1, load into a2, fly to l1_1, then truck t1 (which is at l1_1 after step 3) drives to l1_5.

But let's see:

Plan for p2:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2
2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
3. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
5. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
6. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
7. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
8. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
9. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 (wait, no, p2 is at l1_1. t1 is driven to l1_5, so need to load at l1_1 before driving.)

Wait, that's a problem. If t1 is at l1_1 after step 3 (from p1's plan), then after step 7, p2 is at l1_1. So:

8. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
9. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
10. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

So total steps for p2 would be 10. But combined with p1's steps (11 steps), total would be 21. Hmm, but maybe some steps can be interleaved.

Alternatively, let's try to interleave the two processes. For example, while a1 is flying to l2_1, we can start processing p2's movement.

Wait, but the problem requires a sequence of actions. So all actions must be in order. So perhaps the minimal steps are 20. But maybe there's a smarter way.

Alternative idea: Use airplanes for both directions. For example, after moving p1 to l2_1 via a1, then use a2 to move p2 to l1_1. Let's outline this.

Plan:

For p1:

1. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_4 (c1)
2. Load p1 into t1
3. Drive t1 to l1_1
4. Unload p1
5. Load into a1
6. Fly a1 to l2_1
7. Unload p1
8. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (c2)
9. Load p1 into t2
10. Drive t2 to l2_4
11. Unload p1

For p2:

12. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1 (c2) (but t2 is at l2_4 after step 10)
13. Load p2 into t2 (but p2 is at l2_4, so perhaps we can load p2 when t2 is at l2_4, before driving back to l2_1)

Wait, after step 10, t2 is at l2_4. So p2 is at l2_4. So step 12 can be:

12. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
13. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
14. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
15. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
16. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
17. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
18. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (t1 is at l1_1 from step 3)
19. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
20. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

This gives 20 steps. Is there a way to reduce this?

Wait, what if after step 19, when t1 is driven to l1_5, which is its original location, we can avoid some steps. For example, after step 3, t1 is at l1_1. So after loading p2 into t1 at l1_1 (step 18), driving it to l1_5 (step 19) and unloading (step 20) completes the plan.

Yes, this is 20 steps. But maybe there's a shorter way. Let's see.

Alternative approach: Use airplanes to transport both packages in both directions. Let's see:

But airplanes can only carry packages if they're loaded at their current location. Let's see.

Another idea: After step 6, a1 is at l2_1. Can we use a1 to carry p2 back? But p2 is in c2's l2_4. So, after step 11, a1 is at l2_1. If we load p2 into a1, fly back to l1_1, then unload. But wait, p2 is in l2_4. So to get it to l2_1, we need t2 to transport it.

But perhaps after step 11 (unloading p1 at l2_4), t2 is at l2_4. So:

12. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
13. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
14. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
15. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (since a1 is at l2_1 after step 6)
16. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
17. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
18. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
19. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
20. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

This way, we use a1 for both directions. But since a1 is at l2_1 after step 6, we can use it to carry p2 back. This would save steps because we don't need to use a2. However, a2 is at l2_1 initially. So maybe using a2 is better. Wait, a2 starts at l2_1, so for p2's flight, we can use a2 to fly to l1_1. Let's see:

Alternatively, steps 15-17 for p2 would be:

15. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
16. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
17. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

Then steps 18-20 as before.

But using a2 instead of a1. Either way, same number of steps.

So the total steps are 20. But perhaps there's a way to interleave actions.

Wait, what if after step 6 (fly a1 to l2_1), we start processing p2's truck movement. For example:

After step 6 (a1 is at l2_1), steps for p2 can be:

7. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2 (to pick up p2)
8. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
9. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
10. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
11. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
12. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
13. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
14. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
15. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
16. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

Then continue with p1's steps:

17. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (Wait, no, this would be mixed up. Maybe not.)

Alternatively, process p1 and p2 in parallel:

But in sequence. Let's think:

1. Drive t1 to l1_4, load p1, drive to l1_1, unload, load into a1, fly to l2_1. (steps 1-6)
2. At the same time, drive t2 to l2_4, load p2, drive to l2_1, load into a2, fly to l1_1. Then drive t1 (which is at l1_1) to l1_5.

But in sequence, not parallel. So:

After step 6 (fly a1 to l2_1), process p2:

7. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2
8. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
9. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
10. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
11. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
12. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
13. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
14. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
15. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
16. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
Then continue with p1's steps:
17. unloadtruck p1 a1 l2_1 (Wait, no. After step 6, a1 is at l2_1. Then we need to load p1 into t2. So step 7 would be:

7. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 (to pick up p1)
8. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
9. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
10. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

But this way, steps for p2 are interspersed. Let me try to reorder:

Plan:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
3. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
5. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
6. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

7. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2
8. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
9. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
10. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
11. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
12. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

13. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 (Wait, no. After step 6, p1 is in a1, which is at l2_1. So step 6 is fly, then step 7 onward:

7. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 (but need to unload after flying)
Wait, no. After step 6 (fly), the effect is a1 is now at l2_1, and p1 is still in a1. So after step 6, p1 is in a1 at l2_1. So step 7 should be unload p1 from a1 at l2_1.

7. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
8. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 (wait, t2 is initially at l2_5. To load p1, which is at l2_1, we need t2 to be there.

But this approach is getting complicated. Maybe the initial approach of handling p1 first, then p2, leading to 20 steps is necessary.

But I'm wondering if there's a way to optimize. For example, after unloading p1 at l2_1 (step 7), t2 can be driven to l2_1 to load p1 (step 8), drive to l2_4 (step 9), unload p1 (step 10). Then, t2 is at l2_4 with p2 there. Load p2 (step 11), drive to l2_1 (step 12), unload (13), load into a2 (14), fly to l1_1 (15), unload (16), load into t1 (17), drive to l1_5 (18), unload (19). So total steps would be 19. Let's count:

Steps for p1:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
3. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
5. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
6. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
7. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
8. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
9. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
10. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
11. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

Steps for p2:

12. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (t2 is at l2_4)
13. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
14. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
15. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
16. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
17. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
18. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (t1 is at l1_1)
19. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
20. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

So it's 20 steps. I don't see a way to reduce it further. So the optimal plan should have 20 steps.

But let's cross-verify. Is there a way to combine steps or avoid redundant actions?

For example, when moving t2 to l2_1 for p1 (step 8), then after unloading p1 at l2_4 (step 11), t2 is at l2_4. Then, load p2 into t2 there (step 12), drive back to l2_1 (step 13), unload p2 (step 14), then load into a2 (step 15). So this is necessary.

Alternatively, after step 11 (t2 at l2_4 with p1 unloaded), load p2 into t2 (step 12), drive to l2_1 (step 13), unload (14), load into a2 (15), fly (16), unload (17), load into t1 (18), drive to l1_5 (19), unload (20). Yes, 20 steps.

I think this is the optimal plan. So the answer should be this sequence.
