There seems to be a formatting error in the initial state. The state description contains "Package t1 is in location l1_5" but t1 is a truck, not a package. Similarly, t2, a1, and a2 are also described as packages, but they are a truck and two airplanes. I'll need to infer the correct initial state from context.

I assume these should be as follows:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_5
- Truck t2 is in location l2_3
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

Also, I don't see where packages p1 and p2 are initially located. I'll assume they're both at location l2_1 (the airport in city c2).

So the corrected initial state is:
- Location l1_1 is in city c1 (airport)
- Location l1_2 is in city c1
- Location l1_3 is in city c1
- Location l1_4 is in city c1
- Location l1_5 is in city c1
- Location l2_1 is in city c2 (airport)
- Location l2_2 is in city c2
- Location l2_3 is in city c2
- Location l2_4 is in city c2
- Location l2_5 is in city c2
- Truck t1 is in location l1_5
- Truck t2 is in location l2_3
- Package p1 is in location l2_1
- Package p2 is in location l2_1
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

The goal is:
- Package p1 is in location l1_1
- Package p2 is in location l2_5

Let me plan:

For package p1:
- It's at l2_1 (airport in city c2)
- It needs to go to l1_1 (airport in city c1)
- This requires air transport

For package p2:
- It's at l2_1 (airport in city c2)
- It needs to go to l2_5 (in city c2)
- This requires truck transport within city c2

Plan for p1:
1. Load p1 onto airplane a2 at l2_1
2. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1
3. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1

Plan for p2:
1. We need truck t2 (which is at l2_3) to come to l2_1
2. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1
3. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_1
4. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_5
5. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_5

Combined plan:
1. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
2. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
3. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
4. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
5. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
6. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
7. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5

Wait, there's a typo in the actions. The action to unload from an airplane is also called "loadairplane" instead of "unloadairplane". Let me assume it should be "unloadairplane".

Let me double check this plan for correctness:

Initial state:
- Package p1 is in location l2_1
- Package p2 is in location l2_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1
- Truck t2 is in location l2_3

Actions:
1. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
   Precondition: p1 and a2 are both at l2_1 ✓
   Effect: p1 is in a2, not at l2_1

2. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
   Precondition: t2 is at l2_3, l2_3 and l2_1 are in c2 ✓
   Effect: t2 is at l2_1, not at l2_3

3. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
   Precondition: p2 and t2 are both at l2_1 ✓
   Effect: p2 is in t2, not at l2_1

4. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
   Precondition: a2 is at l2_1 ✓
   Effect: a2 is at l1_1, not at l2_1

5. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
   Precondition: p1 is in a2, a2 is at l1_1 ✓
   Effect: p1 is at l1_1, not in a2

6. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
   Precondition: t2 is at l2_1, l2_1 and l2_5 are in c2 ✓
   Effect: t2 is at l2_5, not at l2_1

7. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
   Precondition: p2 is in t2, t2 is at l2_5 ✓
   Effect: p2 is at l2_5, not in t2

Final state:
- Package p1 is in location l1_1 ✓
- Package p2 is in location l2_5 ✓

The plan seems valid and optimal. Let me check if there's any way to do it with fewer steps.

For p1, we need:
- Load onto airplane
- Fly airplane
- Unload from airplane
These 3 steps are necessary.

For p2, we need:
- Move truck to airport
- Load onto truck
- Drive truck to destination
- Unload from truck
These 4 steps are necessary.

Since the operations for p1 and p2 can be done in parallel, the total is 7 steps, which matches our plan.

Actually, I just realized that "loadairplane p ap l" appears twice in the instructions, once for loading and once for unloading. The unloading action should be "unloadairplane p ap l" based on context.

Let me check for any other potential issues... The airport locations are designated as l1_1 and l2_1. The plan involves flying between these two airports, which is consistent with the domain rules.

I believe the plan is optimal and correct.

1. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
2. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
3. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
4. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
5. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
6. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
7. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
