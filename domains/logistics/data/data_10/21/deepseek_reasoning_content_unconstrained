Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. Hmm, the goal is to get package p1 to l2_5 and p2 to l2_1. Let me start by understanding the initial state.

First, the cities and locations. So c1 has l1_1 (which is an airport), l1_2 to l1_5. c2 has l2_1 (airport), l2_2 to l2_5. The trucks are t1 and t2. Wait, wait, looking at the original state: "Package t1 is in location l1_2". Wait, wait, that must be a typo. Because t1 is a truck, right? So probably "Truck t1 is in location l1_2". Similarly for t2. Because packages are p1, p2. Let me check the original state again. Oh, the user wrote "Package t1 is in location l1_2" but that's probably a mistake. Wait, but according to the problem statement, the world includes "truck t1" and "truck t2". So the original state must have the trucks in certain locations. But the original state as given has "Package t1 is in l1_2" — that's probably a typo. Maybe it's supposed to be "Truck t1 is in l1_2". Similarly, "Package a1 is in l1_1" — but a1 is an airplane, so maybe that's a typo too. Because airplanes should be at airports. Let me parse the original state again.

Original state:

- Locations for c1 and c2 as listed.

Then:

"Package t1 is in location l1_2" — Wait, t1 is a truck, not a package. So this must be a mistake. Maybe it's "Truck t1 is in l1_2". Similarly, "Package t2 is in location l2_3" — that should be Truck t2 in l2_3. Then the packages are p1 in l2_3, p2 in l2_4. Airplanes a1 in l1_1 (airport), a2 in l2_1 (airport). So that makes sense. So the user probably made a typo in listing the original state. So the trucks are t1 in l1_2 (city c1), t2 in l2_3 (city c2). The packages: p1 is in l2_3 (same as t2's location), p2 in l2_4. Airplanes a1 at l1_1 (c1's airport), a2 at l2_1 (c2's airport).

The goal is p1 in l2_5 and p2 in l2_1. So for p2, since it's in l2_4, maybe we can use truck t2 (which is in l2_3) to drive to l2_4, pick up p2, then drive to l2_1? Wait, l2_1 is an airport in c2. But can a truck drive from l2_4 to l2_1? Since l2_4 is in c2, and l2_1 is in c2, so yes. So for p2: drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_4 (if possible; check city). Since l2_3 and l2_4 are both in c2. Then load p2 into t2 at l2_4, then drive t2 to l2_1, unload p2 there. That seems straightforward. But wait, initial position of t2 is l2_3. So steps would be: drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_4, load p2, drive to l2_1, unload. That would get p2 to l2_1.

For p1, which is in l2_3. The goal is l2_5. Let's see. l2_5 is in c2, so using truck t2. But t2 is in l2_3. So maybe load p1 into t2 at l2_3, drive to l2_5, unload. Wait, but wait, p1 is already in l2_3 where t2 is. So load p1 into t2, drive t2 to l2_5, unload. That's possible. But then we need to do that for p1 and also handle p2. But the problem is that both p1 and p2 need to be moved. So the plan would need to handle both. However, the truck t2 is in l2_3. Let's see: t2 is in l2_3, p1 is in l2_3, p2 in l2_4. So first, load p1 into t2 at l2_3. Then drive t2 to l2_4 (to get p2). But wait, after loading p1 into t2, drive to l2_4, load p2, then drive to l2_5 (for p1) and l2_1 (for p2). But that might not work because after driving to l2_4, you can unload p1 there, but that's not the goal. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe move p1 first. So:

For p1:

1. Load p1 into t2 at l2_3.

2. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_5.

3. Unload p1 at l2_5.

For p2:

But t2 is now in l2_5. To get p2 from l2_4, t2 needs to drive back to l2_4, load p2, then drive to l2_1.

But that would require driving t2 from l2_5 to l2_4 (possible in c2), load p2, drive to l2_1, unload. But that's two trips. The total steps would be:

Actions for p1:

loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2

unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

Then for p2:

drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2

loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2

unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

So that's 7 actions. But maybe there's a more optimal way. Wait, but initially, t2 is at l2_3. So:

Alternatively, for p2: since p2 is in l2_4, which is in c2. The goal is l2_1. So t2 could drive from l2_3 to l2_4, load p2, drive to l2_1, unload. That's three actions. Then, for p1: t2 is now in l2_1, but p1 is in l2_3. So t2 would need to drive back to l2_3 (from l2_1 via other locations?), but l2_1 is an airport. Wait, cities have multiple locations. The truck can drive between any locations in the same city. So l2_1 is in c2, so t2 can drive from l2_1 to l2_3 if there's a path. Wait, but the locations in c2 are l2_1, l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5. So the truck can drive directly between any two locations in c2. So for example, from l2_1 to l2_3 directly. So, after delivering p2 to l2_1, drive t2 to l2_3 again, load p1, drive to l2_5. So total steps:

For p2:

drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2

loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2

unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 → 4 actions.

Then for p1:

drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2 → drive from l2_1 to l2_3.

loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2

unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 → another 4 actions. Total of 8.

But the previous approach was 7 actions. Which is better? Wait, the first approach had:

For p1: load, drive, unload (3 steps).

Then, drive to l2_4 (1), load p2 (2), drive to l2_1 (3), unload (4). So total 3+4=7 steps. So that's better.

But in the first approach, after delivering p1 to l2_5, the truck is at l2_5. Then to get p2, it needs to drive from l2_5 to l2_4 (possible, same city). Then load p2, drive to l2_1, unload. So that's three more steps. So total steps would be 3 (for p1) + 3 (for p2 after) = 6 steps? Wait no:

Wait, let's outline the steps:

1. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

2. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2

3. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 → p1 done.

Then for p2:

4. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2

5. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

6. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2

7. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 → p2 done.

So total 7 steps. But maybe there's a way to do it in fewer steps. Let's see.

Alternatively, use airplanes. Wait, p1 is in l2_3 (c2), which is a city. The goal is l2_5 (c2). So using a truck is the way. For p2, it's in l2_4 (c2), needs to go to l2_1 (airport in c2). So using a truck is also feasible. However, perhaps using an airplane for p2. But the airplanes are a1 in l1_1 (c1's airport) and a2 in l2_1 (c2's airport). So a2 is already at l2_1. But p2 is in l2_4, which is a non-airport location. To use an airplane, you need to get the package to an airport. But l2_1 is the airport. So for p2, since the goal is l2_1, maybe just drive the truck to l2_1. So using the truck is better.

So the initial plan using the truck for both seems feasible. But let's check if there are any constraints. The problem says that the plan must satisfy all constraints, but the user hasn't listed any additional constraints beyond the preconditions of the actions. So the main constraints are the action preconditions.

Another thing to check: Are there any other vehicles or ways to transport the packages? For example, if a package needs to move between cities, you might need an airplane. But in this case, both packages are in c2, and their destinations are also in c2. So no need for airplanes. So using truck t2 (which is in c2) should be sufficient.

So the optimal plan would be:

For p1:

1. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

2. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2

3. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

For p2:

4. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2

5. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

6. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2

7. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

That's 7 actions. But is there a way to reduce the steps? Let's see. Maybe reorder the actions.

Wait, when you load p1 into t2 at l2_3, then drive to l2_5. Then, after unloading p1, the truck is at l2_5. Then drive to l2_4 (step 4), load p2 (step5), drive to l2_1 (step6), unload (step7). That's 7 steps.

But what if we do the p2 first?

For p2:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2

2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

3. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2

4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 → p2 done.

Then, t2 is at l2_1. Then, drive to l2_3:

5. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2

6. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

7. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2

8. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 → p1 done. Total 8 steps. So the previous order is better.

Alternatively, can we interleave the steps?

Like:

1. load p1 into t2 at l2_3.

2. drive to l2_4.

But then you can't unload p1 there. Hmm. No, that's not helpful. Or:

Wait, maybe when moving from l2_3 to l2_5, can we pass through other locations? But the drive action allows moving directly between any two locations in the same city. So it's a single step. So no need for intermediate steps.

So the initial plan of 7 steps seems optimal.

Wait, but is there a way to combine the steps? Let's see. For example, after moving to l2_5 with p1, then moving to l2_4, but perhaps the truck can carry both packages. Let's check. The problem doesn't state any constraints on the capacity of trucks, so assuming they can carry multiple packages. So in the initial plan, after unloading p1 at l2_5, the truck is empty. Then, drive to l2_4, load p2, drive to l2_1. So that's correct.

Alternatively, could the truck pick up p2 first, then p1? Let me think. Wait, p1 is in l2_3 (truck's initial location), p2 is in l2_4. So:

1. drive t2 to l2_4.

2. load p2.

3. drive back to l2_3.

4. load p1.

5. drive to l2_5, unload p1.

6. drive to l2_1, unload p2.

That's 6 steps. Wait, let's check:

Step 1: drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2.

Step 2: loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4.

Step3: drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2.

Step4: loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3.

Step5: drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2.

Step6: unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5.

Step7: drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2.

Step8: unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.

That's 8 steps, which is worse than the previous 7. So no gain.

Alternatively, after loading p2 in l2_4, drive to l2_1, unload p2 (that's 3 steps), then drive to l2_3, load p1, drive to l2_5 (another 3 steps). Total 6 steps. Wait:

Steps:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2 → 1.

2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 → 2.

3. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2 →3.

4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 →4. (p2 done)

5. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2 →5.

6. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 →6.

7. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2 →7.

8. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 →8.

Still 8 steps. So no improvement.

So the initial plan of 7 steps seems better. Unless there's a way to carry both packages at once. Let's see: can the truck carry both p1 and p2?

Assuming that the truck can carry multiple packages, then after loading p1 and p2, drive to l2_5, unload p1, then drive to l2_1 and unload p2. Let's see:

1. load p1 into t2 at l2_3.

2. drive to l2_4.

3. load p2 into t2 at l2_4.

4. drive to l2_5.

5. unload p1.

6. drive to l2_1.

7. unload p2.

That's 7 steps as well. Let's check:

Step 1: loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3.

Step2: drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2.

Step3: loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4.

Step4: drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2.

Step5: unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5.

Step6: drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2.

Step7: unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.

Yes, that's 7 steps. But is this valid? Let's check preconditions:

Step1: p1 and t2 are in l2_3. Load possible.

Step2: drive from l2_3 to l2_4 (same city). Possible.

Step3: p2 is in l2_4, t2 is there. Load possible.

Step4: drive to l2_5. Possible.

Step5: t2 is in l2_5, p1 is in t2. Unload possible.

Step6: drive to l2_1. Possible.

Step7: t2 in l2_1, p2 in t2. Unload possible.

Yes, that works. So this plan is 7 steps as well. But is it better than the previous approach? Let's see. The total steps are the same. But does this sequence work?

Yes. So this is another valid 7-step plan. But perhaps this is better because it's more efficient in movement. Let's see:

Original approach: 7 steps.

Alternative approach with loading both packages:

Yes, the steps are:

load p1 → drive to l2_4 → load p2 → drive to l2_5 → unload p1 → drive to l2_1 → unload p2. So same number of steps. But maybe this is more efficient. Both are 7 steps, so either is acceptable as optimal.

But which is shorter? Both are same. So either is optimal.

But wait, in the alternative approach, step4 is driving to l2_5 (from l2_4). Then step6 is driving from l2_5 to l2_1. Are those locations connected? Yes, same city. So possible.

So both plans are valid and optimal. So either can be presented.

But perhaps there's a way to do it in 6 steps. Let's think. For example:

1. load p1 into t2 at l2_3.

2. drive to l2_5, unload p1 (steps 1-3).

3. Then drive to l2_4 (step4), load p2 (step5), drive to l2_1 (step6), unload (step7). 7 steps.

Alternatively, if after unloading p1 at l2_5, can the truck drive directly to l2_1? Wait, l2_5 is in c2. So truck can drive from l2_5 to l2_1 directly. Then, after unloading p1 at l2_5, drive to l2_4 (is that possible? Wait, no. Because after unloading p1, the truck is at l2_5. To get to l2_4, it has to drive from l2_5 to l2_4. Then load p2, then drive to l2_1. So that's:

Steps:

1. load p1.

2. drive to l2_5.

3. unload p1.

4. drive to l2_4.

5. load p2.

6. drive to l2_1.

7. unload p2.

Same 7 steps.

Alternatively, is there a way to avoid driving from l2_5 to l2_4? For example, if after loading p1, the truck goes to l2_4 first, then to l2_5. But that would require:

1. load p1.

2. drive to l2_4.

3. load p2.

4. drive to l2_5.

5. unload p1.

6. drive to l2_1.

7. unload p2.

Same as the alternative plan.

So no, it's still 7 steps.

So the optimal plan length is 7 steps.

Now, let's verify that there are no shorter plans. For example, can we use airplanes to reduce steps?

For instance, moving p2 to the airport via airplane. But p2 is in l2_4. To use an airplane, you need to load it into a truck, drive to an airport, load into airplane, fly to destination. But since the destination is l2_1 (airport), maybe:

But for p2, which is in l2_4 (c2), the airport is l2_1. So using the truck to drive directly to l2_1 is more efficient. Because using an airplane would require:

1. drive t2 to l2_4.

2. load p2.

3. drive to l2_1.

4. unload p2.

Which is three steps (drive, load, drive, unload) → 4 steps. Wait, no: steps would be:

drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_4 (1), load p2 (2), drive to l2_1 (3), unload (4). So four steps. But in the previous plan, handling both p1 and p2 takes 7 steps. But if we use airplanes for one of them, maybe we can do better?

Wait, but p1 is in c2, needs to go to l2_5. So no need for airplanes. So using the truck is better.

So no, using airplanes doesn't help here.

Thus, the optimal plan is 7 steps. Now, writing the plan in the required format. Let's pick one of the 7-step plans. Let's choose the one where both packages are loaded into the truck in sequence.

The steps would be:

1. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

2. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2

3. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

4. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2

5. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

6. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2

7. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

Wait, but in this plan, after step4, the truck is at l2_5 with both p1 and p2. Then unload p1 (step5), then drive to l2_1 (step6), unload p2 (step7). Yes, that works. So this plan is 7 steps. Let's check each step's preconditions:

1. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3: p1 and t2 are in l2_3. Correct.

2. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2: t2 is in l2_3, moving to l2_4 in c2. Correct.

3. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4: p2 and t2 are in l2_4. Correct.

4. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2: Yes.

5. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5: t2 is in l2_5, p1 is in t2. Correct.

6. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2: Possible.

7. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1: t2 is in l2_1, p2 is in t2. Correct.

Yes, this plan is valid and achieves both goals in 7 steps.

Alternatively, the other plan where p1 is delivered first:

1. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

2. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2

3. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

4. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2

5. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

6. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2

7. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

Also valid. Which one is better? Both have the same number of steps. So either is acceptable.

But the user wants an optimal plan, and since both are 7 steps, either is correct. I'll choose the second one because it's more straightforward for each package sequentially.

Now, formatting the plan with the required triple backticks.
