I'll analyze this logistics planning problem and provide an optimal plan that satisfies all the constraints.

First, let me correct some issues in the problem statement:
- There seems to be confusion between trucks/airplanes and packages in the initial state (t1, t2, a1, a2 are listed as packages)
- There's a duplicate action definition for "loadairplane" where one should be "unloadairplane"

Let me assume the correct initial state is:
- Trucks t1 is in location l1_5 and t2 is in location l2_1
- Airplanes a1 is in location l1_1 and a2 is in location l2_1
- Packages p1 is in location l2_2 and p2 is in location l1_5

Now I'll create a plan that satisfies all constraints and achieves the goal:

```
drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
```
