Let me analyze the problem statement. 

We have a logistics problem where we need to transport packages from initial locations to goal locations using trucks (for intra-city transport) and airplanes (for inter-city transport).

First, let me check for any inconsistencies or errors in the problem statement:

1. The actions include "loadairplane" twice, where the second one should be "unloadairplane".
2. Some packages are stated to be t1, t2, a1, and a2, which seem to be trucks and airplanes, not packages.

Let me clarify the initial state based on what makes logical sense:

Objects:
- Locations: l1_1, l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5, l2_1, l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5
- Cities: c1, c2
- Packages: p1, p2
- Trucks: t1, t2
- Airplanes: a1, a2
- Airports: l1_1 (in city c1), l2_1 (in city c2)

Initial state:
- All l1_x locations are in city c1
- All l2_x locations are in city c2
- Truck t1 is in location l1_5 (not "Package t1")
- Truck t2 is in location l2_1 (not "Package t2")
- Package p1 is in location l2_2
- Package p2 is in location l1_5
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (not "Package a1")
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1 (not "Package a2")

Goal:
- Package p1 should be in location l1_2
- Package p2 should be in location l2_4

Let me plan how to achieve this goal:

For p1:
1. We need to move p1 from l2_2 to l1_2
2. Since they're in different cities, we need to use an airplane
3. We need to:
   a. Move p1 from l2_2 to airport l2_1 using truck t2
   b. Load p1 onto airplane a2 at l2_1
   c. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1
   d. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1
   e. Load p1 onto truck t1 (need to move t1 from l1_5 to l1_1 first)
   f. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_2
   g. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_2

For p2:
1. We need to move p2 from l1_5 to l2_4
2. Since they're in different cities, we need to use an airplane
3. We need to:
   a. Load p2 onto truck t1 at l1_5
   b. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_1 (airport)
   c. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_1
   d. Load p2 onto airplane a1 at l1_1
   e. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1
   f. Unload p2 from a1 at l2_1
   g. Load p2 onto truck t2 at l2_1
   h. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4
   i. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_4

Now I'll put together a complete plan with a careful ordering of actions:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2     (Move truck t2, which is at airport l2_1, to l2_2 where p1 is)
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2           (Load package p1 into truck t2 at l2_2)
3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2     (Move truck t2 with p1 back to airport l2_1)
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1         (Unload p1 from t2 at airport l2_1)
5. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1        (Load p1 onto airplane a2 at airport l2_1)
6. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1       (Fly a2 with p1 from airport l2_1 to airport l1_1)
7. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1      (Unload p1 from a2 at airport l1_1)

Hmm, wait. I think I might have misunderstood the initial state. Let me double-check:

The initial state says:
"Package t1 is in location l1_5"
"Package t2 is in location l2_1"
"Package p1 is in location l2_2"
"Package p2 is in location l1_5"
"Package a1 is in location l1_1"
"Package a2 is in location l2_1"

This doesn't make sense since t1, t2, a1, and a2 are not packages. Let's assume these statements are actually meant to tell us where the trucks and airplanes are located. So:

- Truck t1 is in location l1_5
- Truck t2 is in location l2_1
- Package p1 is in location l2_2
- Package p2 is in location l1_5
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

Let me continue the plan from step 7:

8. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1        (I realize this is incorrect as t1 is at l1_5, not l1_1. Let me revise)

Let me revise the plan with a corrected understanding of the initial state:

For p1 (from l2_2 to l1_2):
1. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2     (Move truck t2 to get p1)
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2           (Load p1 into t2)
3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2     (Move t2 with p1 to airport)
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1         (Unload p1 at airport)
5. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1        (Load p1 onto airplane a2)
6. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1       (Fly a2 to city c1's airport)
7. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1      (Unload p1 at city c1's airport)
8. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1     (Move truck t1 from l1_5 to airport l1_1)
9. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1           (Load p1 into t1)
10. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1    (Move t1 to destination l1_2)
11. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2        (Unload p1 at destination)

For p2 (from l1_5 to l2_4):
12. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_5 c1    (Move t1 back to get p2)
13. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5          (Load p2 into t1)
14. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1    (Move t1 with p2 to airport)
15. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1        (Unload p2 at airport)
16. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1       (Load p2 onto airplane a1)
17. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1      (Fly a1 to city c2's airport)
18. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1     (Unload p2 at city c2's airport)
19. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1          (Load p2 into t2)
20. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2    (Move t2 to destination l2_4)
21. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4        (Unload p2 at destination)

Now let me check if I can optimize this plan:

I notice that I'm sending t1 back and forth. Let me see if I can rearrange the actions to be more efficient:

1. We first need to get p1 from l2_2 to l1_2
2. We also need to get p2 from l1_5 to l2_4

Since t1 is initially at l1_5 where p2 is, and t2 is at l2_1, we might be able to start moving packages concurrently.

But wait, there's a potential issue: After step 11, t1 is at l1_2. We then need to send it back to l1_5 to pick up p2, but p2 is already at l1_5 from the beginning. We should handle p2 first, or use a more efficient ordering.

Let me revise the plan again to be more optimal:

For p2 (from l1_5 to l2_4):
1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5          (Load p2 into t1, which is already at l1_5)
2. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1    (Move t1 with p2 to airport)
3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1        (Unload p2 at airport)
4. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1       (Load p2 onto airplane a1)
5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1      (Fly a1 to city c2's airport)
6. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1     (Unload p2 at city c2's airport)
7. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1          (Load p2 into t2)
8. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2    (Move t2 to destination l2_4)
9. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4        (Unload p2 at destination)

For p1 (from l2_2 to l1_2):
10. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2     (Move truck t2 to get p1)
11. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2           (Load p1 into t2)
12. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2     (Move t2 with p1 to airport)
13. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1         (Unload p1 at airport)
14. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1        (Load p1 onto airplane a2)
15. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1       (Fly a2 to city c1's airport)
16. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1      (Unload p1 at city c1's airport)
17. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1           (Load p1 into t1)
18. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1    (Move t1 to destination l1_2)
19. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2        (Unload p1 at destination)

The plan length is 19 actions. Let me see if I can optimize further...

I could potentially use different resources for the two packages simultaneously. For example, while truck t1 is transporting p2, truck t2 could be transporting p1, and vice versa for the airplanes. But I need to check if this would actually save steps.

Let me try a concurrent approach:

Package p1 (using truck t2 and airplane a2):
1. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2     (Move truck t2 to get p1)
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2           (Load p1 into t2)
3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2     (Move t2 with p1 to airport)
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1         (Unload p1 at airport)
5. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1        (Load p1 onto airplane a2)
6. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1       (Fly a2 to city c1's airport)
7. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1      (Unload p1 at city c1's airport)

Package p2 (using truck t1 and airplane a1):
8. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5          (Load p2 into t1, which is already at l1_5)
9. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1    (Move t1 with p2 to airport)
10. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1        (Unload p2 at airport)
11. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1       (Load p2 onto airplane a1)
12. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1      (Fly a1 to city c2's airport)
13. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1     (Unload p2 at city c2's airport)

Now we need to complete both tasks:
14. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1           (Load p1 into t1)
15. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1    (Move t1 to destination l1_2)
16. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2        (Unload p1 at destination)
17. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1          (Load p2 into t2)
18. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2    (Move t2 to destination l2_4)
19. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4        (Unload p2 at destination)

The plan is still 19 steps, but we've ordered it differently to handle both packages somewhat concurrently.

Actually, let me see if I can optimize further. I notice that:
- Steps 8-13 for p2 have to happen after t1 is done with steps 14-16 for p1
- But steps 14-16 for p1 have to happen after steps 1-7 for p1

In other words, we're introducing a dependency where none exists. Let me revise the ordering:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
5. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
6. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
7. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

At this point, we can do two things in parallel:
- Continue with p1 using t1
- Start with p2 using t1

The issue is that we need t1 for both tasks, so we can't really parallelize further. Let's continue:

8. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
9. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
10. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
11. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
12. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
13. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
14. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
15. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
16. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
17. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
18. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
19. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

This still results in a 19-step plan. Let me check once more if I can optimize...

Wait, I just realized a potential optimization. Since p1 is at l2_2 and needs to go to l1_2, and p2 is at l1_5 and needs to go to l2_4, we could:
1. Move p1 from l2_2 to airport l2_1 using truck t2
2. Move p2 from l1_5 to airport l1_1 using truck t1
3. Load p1 onto airplane a2 and p2 onto airplane a1
4. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1 and a1 from l1_1 to l2_1
5. Unload p1 at l1_1 and p2 at l2_1
6. Load p1 onto truck t1 at l1_1 and p2 onto truck t2 at l2_1
7. Drive t1 to l1_2 and t2 to l2_4
8. Unload p1 at l1_2 and p2 at l2_4

Let me organize this into a plan:

For p1:
1. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2     (Move truck t2 to get p1)
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2           (Load p1 into t2)
3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2     (Move t2 with p1 to airport)
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1         (Unload p1 at airport)
5. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1        (Load p1 onto airplane a2)

For p2 (can be done concurrently with steps for p1):
6. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5          (Load p2 into t1, which is already at l1_5)
7. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1    (Move t1 with p2 to airport)
8. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1        (Unload p2 at airport)
9. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1       (Load p2 onto airplane a1)

Now we fly the airplanes:
10. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1       (Fly a2 to city c1's airport)
11. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1      (Fly a1 to city c2's airport)

Let's unload, load in the destination cities, and deliver:
12. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1      (Unload p1 at city c1's airport)
13. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1           (Load p1 into t1)
14. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1    (Move t1 to destination l1_2)
15. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2        (Unload p1 at destination)
16. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1     (Unload p2 at city c2's airport)
17. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1          (Load p2 into t2)
18. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2    (Move t2 to destination l2_4)
19. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4        (Unload p2 at destination)

I've tried various configurations, but it seems like 19 steps is the minimum for this problem.

Let me write out the final plan:

```
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
```

Actually, let me verify a couple of things:

- First, do airplanes fly from airports to airports? The problem says "airplanes may move between airports" but it doesn't explicitly state that the two locations (l_from and l_to) in the "flyairplane" action need to be airports. Let's assume they do need to be airports.

- Second, let me double-check the initial state again:

"Truck t1 is in location l1_5" (in city c1)
"Truck t2 is in location l2_1" (in city c2)
"Package p1 is in location l2_2" (in city c2)
"Package p2 is in location l1_5" (in city c1)
"Airplane a1 is in location l1_1" (airport in city c1)
"Airplane a2 is in location l2_1" (airport in city c2)

The goal is:
"Package p1 is in location l1_2" (in city c1)
"Package p2 is in location l2_4" (in city c2)

So we need to move:
- p1 from l2_2 to l1_2 (across cities)
- p2 from l1_5 to l2_4 (across cities)

My plan seems correct, but let me make sure there are no mistakes:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2      (Move truck t2 from the airport to get p1)
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2            (Load p1 into t2)
3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2      (Move t2 with p1 to the airport)
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1          (Unload p1 at the airport)
5. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1         (Load p1 onto airplane a2)
6. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5            (Load p2 into t1, which is already at l1_5)
7. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1      (Move t1 with p2 to the airport)
8. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1          (Unload p2 at the airport)
9. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1         (Load p2 onto airplane a1)
10. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1       (Fly a2 from c2's airport to c1's airport)
11. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1       (Fly a1 from c1's airport to c2's airport)
12. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1      (Unload p1 at c1's airport)
13. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1           (Load p1 into t1)
14. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1     (Move t1 to destination l1_2)
15. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2         (Unload p1 at destination)
16. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1      (Unload p2 at c2's airport)
17. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1           (Load p2 into t2)
18. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2     (Move t2 to destination l2_4)
19. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4         (Unload p2 at destination)

Everything looks correct in this plan. Let me double-check each step:

1. t2 starts at l2_1, so it can drive to l2_2
2. t2 and p1 are both at l2_2, so p1 can be loaded into t2
3. t2 is at l2_2, so it can drive back to l2_1
4. t2 is at l2_1 and contains p1, so p1 can be unloaded
5. a2 and p1 are both at l2_1, so p1 can be loaded into a2
6. t1 and p2 are both at l1_5, so p2 can be loaded into t1
7. t1 is at l1_5, so it can drive to l1_1
8. t1 is at l1_1 and contains p2, so p2 can be unloaded
9. a1 and p2 are both at l1_1, so p2 can be loaded into a1
10. a2 is at l2_1, so it can fly to l1_1
11. a1 is at l1_1, so it can fly to l2_1
12. a2 is at l1_1 and contains p1, so p1 can be unloaded
13. t1 and p1 are both at l1_1, so p1 can be loaded into t1
14. t1 is at l1_1, so it can drive to l1_2
15. t1 is at l1_2 and contains p1, so p1 can be unloaded
16. a1 is at l2_1 and contains p2, so p2 can be unloaded
17. t2 and p2 are both at l2_1, so p2 can be loaded into t2
18. t2 is at l2_1, so it can drive to l2_4
19. t2 is at l2_4 and contains p2, so p2 can be unloaded

The plan is valid, and the final state achieves our goal of having p1 at l1_2 and p2 at l2_4.

Let me check if I can reorder any steps to make the plan shorter...

I notice that steps 10 and 11 (flying the airplanes) can be reordered, but that doesn't reduce the plan length.

Also, I notice I didn't capitalize the actions and used underscores in the city and location names. Let me correct that in the final plan:

```
DRIVETRUCK t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
LOADTRUCK p1 t2 l2_2
DRIVETRUCK t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
UNLOADTRUCK p1 t2 l2_1
LOADAIRPLANE p1 a2 l2_1
LOADTRUCK p2 t1 l1_5
DRIVETRUCK t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
UNLOADTRUCK p2 t1 l1_1
LOADAIRPLANE p2 a1 l1_1
FLYAIRPLANE a2 l2_1 l1_1
FLYAIRPLANE a1 l1_1 l2_1
UNLOADAIRPLANE p1 a2 l1_1
LOADTRUCK p1 t1 l1_1
DRIVETRUCK t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
UNLOADTRUCK p1 t1 l1_2
UNLOADAIRPLANE p2 a1 l2_1
LOADTRUCK p2 t2 l2_1
DRIVETRUCK t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
UNLOADTRUCK p2 t2 l2_4
```

Actually, I see that the action names in the problem statement are lowercase, so I'll stick with those. And I don't see underscores in the location names, so I'll omit those too.

```
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
```

Oh, but the location names in the problem statement DO have underscores:
"Package t1 is in location l1_5"

So the correct format is:

```
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
```

Upon further reading of the problem, it states "loadairplane" twice, where one is actually supposed to be "unloadairplane":
```
"loadtruck p t l": Load package p in truck t. Both p and t are in location l.
"loadairplane p ap l": Load package p in airplane ap. Both p and ap are in location l.
"unloadtruck p t l": Unload package p from truck t in location l.
"loadairplane p ap l": Unload package p from airplane ap in location l.
```

This second "loadairplane" is supposed to be "unloadairplane". And indeed, I've been using "unloadairplane" in my plan. So my plan should be correct in that regard.

Here's the final, optimal plan with 19 steps:

```
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
```
