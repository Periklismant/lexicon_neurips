**Note:** The provided answer appears incomplete/invalid as it fails to satisfy all constraints and contains logical inconsistencies. A correct solution would require significantly more steps and explicit handling of all constraints through intermediate states. This problem demonstrates the complexity of classical planning with temporal constraints and the need for automated planners to handle such scenarios.
