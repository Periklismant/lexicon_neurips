Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. Hmm, the goal is to get package p1 to l1_2 in city c1 and package p2 to l2_4 in city c2. Let's see where everything starts.

First, looking at the initial state. Wait, the original state says "Package t1 is in location l1_5", "Package t2 is in location l2_1", but t1 and t2 are trucks, right? Because the objects listed include trucks t1 and t2. Oh, wait, maybe that's a typo. Wait, the original state descriptions might have a mistake. Let me check again.

The original state lists "Package t1 is in location l1_5". Wait, but t1 is a truck. Trucks are in locations, not packages. That must be a mistake. Similarly, "Package t2 is in location l2_1", but t2 is a truck. Same with "Package a1 is in location l1_1" and "Package a2 is in location l2_1" â€” a1 and a2 are airplanes. So the initial state probably should state that the trucks and airplanes are in those locations, not as packages. Maybe it's a typo in the problem description. Because otherwise, the problem would be impossible. For example, if t1 is a package, then we can't drive it. But the problem mentions trucks t1 and t2, so I think the original state should have the trucks and airplanes in those locations, not as packages. So assuming that's a mistake, let's proceed.

So correct initial state:

Truck t1 is in l1_5.

Truck t2 is in l2_1.

Airplane a1 is in l1_1 (airport of c1).

Airplane a2 is in l2_1 (airport of c2).

Packages: p1 is in l2_2 (city c2), p2 is in l1_5 (city c1).

So, the goal is to get p1 to l1_2 (c1) and p2 to l2_4 (c2).

Constraints: Well, the constraints aren't listed here, but the problem says "must abide by the following constraints" but the user didn't paste them. Wait, looking back: the user wrote "A valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints:" but then nothing. Maybe it's a formatting error, but perhaps there are no additional constraints beyond the usual preconditions. So maybe the constraints are just the standard action preconditions.

So, for p1: it's in l2_2 (c2). Need to get it to l1_2 (c1). Since cities are connected by airplanes. So possible steps: use truck in c2 to move p1 to the airport (l2_1), load into airplane a2, fly to c1's airport (l1_1), unload, then use a truck in c1 to move to l1_2.

Wait, but c2's airport is l2_1. So p1 is in l2_2. So first, maybe use truck t2 (which is in l2_1) to drive to l2_2. Wait, but t2 is in l2_1. So drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2 (same city c2). Then load p1 into t2. Then drive t2 back to l2_1 (airport). Then unload p1 at l2_1, then load into airplane a2 (which is at l2_1). Then fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1. Then unload p1 at l1_1. Then use truck t1, which is in l1_5. But wait, l1_1 is the airport of c1. So maybe there's another truck in c1? Wait, the objects include t1 and t2. t1 is in l1_5 (city c1). So to move from l1_1 (airport) to l1_2, need a truck. Wait, but t1 is in l1_5. So drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_1? But l1_1 is in c1. So truck t1 can drive there. Then load p1 into t1 at l1_1, drive to l1_2, and unload.

But wait, the initial state of t1 is in l1_5, so maybe:

For p1:

1. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2 (c2) [since t2 is in l2_1, and l2_2 is in c2].

2. Load p1 into t2 at l2_2.

3. Drive t2 back to l2_1.

4. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1.

5. Load p1 into airplane a2 at l2_1.

6. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1 (c1's airport).

7. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1.

8. Now, to get p1 to l1_2. Need a truck in c1. t1 is in l1_5, so drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_1.

9. Load p1 into t1 at l1_1.

10. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_2.

11. Unload p1 at l1_2. Done.

For p2: it's in l1_5 (c1). Need to get to l2_4 (c2). So similar approach:

1. Use t1 (already in l1_5) to load p2.

Wait, but if we use t1 for both p1 and p2, the sequence might be interleaved. Let's see.

Wait, p2 is in l1_5. So steps for p2:

1. Load p2 into t1 at l1_5 (since t1 is there).

2. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_1 (airport of c1).

3. Unload p2 at l1_1.

4. Load p2 into airplane a1 (which is at l1_1).

5. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1 (c2's airport).

6. Unload p2 at l2_1.

7. Then, use truck t2 (in l2_1) to drive to l2_4 (which is in c2).

8. Load p2 into t2 at l2_1.

9. Drive t2 to l2_4.

10. Unload p2 at l2_4. Done.

But we need to make sure that the steps for p1 and p2 can be interleaved optimally. Let's see if we can find a plan that combines both sequences efficiently.

Let's outline the steps:

For p1:

- Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2.

- Load p1 into t2.

- Drive t2 to l2_1.

- Unload p1.

- Load into a2.

- Fly a2 to l1_1.

- Unload p1.

- Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_1.

- Load p1 into t1.

- Drive to l1_2.

- Unload.

For p2:

- Load p2 into t1 at l1_5.

- Drive t1 to l1_1 (but this conflicts with p1's steps where t1 needs to go to l1_1 after p1 arrives. Wait, but maybe we can handle this in a different order.

Alternatively, perhaps first handle p2's transport first, using a1 to fly to c2, then t2 to take it to l2_4.

Wait, let's try to plan both.

But let's think of the order. Let's process both packages' steps in parallel where possible.

But perhaps it's better to first handle p1's steps until it's loaded into a2 and flown to l1_1, and then handle p2's steps.

But let's try to find the minimal steps.

Wait, here's a possible plan:

1. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2 (c2). [For p1]

2. Load p1 into t2 at l2_2.

3. Drive t2 back to l2_1.

4. Unload p1 at l2_1.

5. Load p1 into a2.

6. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.

7. Unload p1 at l1_1.

8. Now, for p1: Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_1. [But t1 is in l1_5.]

9. Load p1 into t1 at l1_1.

10. Drive t1 to l1_2.

11. Unload p1.

For p2:

12. Load p2 into t1 at l1_5. Wait, but t1 is moving to l1_1 in step 8. So we need to handle p2 before moving t1.

So perhaps:

1. Load p2 into t1 at l1_5. [Since t1 is there.]

2. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_1. [Bringing p2 to the airport.]

3. Unload p2 at l1_1.

4. Load p2 into a1 (which is at l1_1).

5. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1 (c2's airport).

6. Unload p2 at l2_1.

7. Then, use t2 (which is in l2_1) to drive to l2_4.

8. Load p2 into t2.

9. Drive t2 to l2_4.

10. Unload p2.

But how does this interleave with p1's steps? Let's see.

So combining both sequences:

But the problem is that t1 is used for both p1 and p2. Wait, t1 is in l1_5 initially. For p2, we can load p2 into t1 at l1_5, drive to l1_1, unload, then use a1 to fly to l2_1, etc. Then, after that, for p1, we need to get t1 from l1_1 back to l1_5? No, because after step 2 (drive t1 to l1_1), t1 is there. So for p1, after we've flown a2 to l1_1 (step 6), we need t1 to be at l1_1 to load p1. But if we first handle p2, then t1 is at l1_1, so steps for p1's part would be:

After step 6 (unload p2 at l2_1), but before that, let's see:

Wait, let's outline the plan in order:

For p2:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

2. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1

3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

4. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

6. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

7. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2

Wait, but l2_4 is in c2. So t2 is in l2_1. Can drive to l2_4 directly if possible. Are l2_1 and l2_4 in the same city? Yes, both in c2. But the drive action requires that l_from and l_to are in the same city. So yes, t2 can drive from l2_1 to l2_4.

But wait, the airport is l2_1. Are the other locations connected? For example, can a truck drive from l2_1 to l2_4 directly? The problem states that trucks can move between locations in the same city, so yes. So:

7. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2

8. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4? No, because after unloading from the airplane, p2 is at l2_1. Wait, step 6 unloads p2 at l2_1. So p2 is at l2_1. Then we need to load it into t2 (which is in l2_1) and drive to l2_4.

Wait, so steps 6: p2 is at l2_1. t2 is in l2_1 (since step 0: t2 is in l2_1, but earlier steps for p1 involved driving t2 to l2_2 and back. Wait, in the earlier steps for p1, steps 1-3 would involve driving t2 from l2_1 to l2_2, then back to l2_1. But if we interleave the two package's steps, we have to make sure t2 is available.

This is getting complex. Let's try to outline the entire plan step by step, making sure that all preconditions are met.

First, for p1 (in l2_2, c2 to l1_2, c1):

- Move t2 from l2_1 to l2_2 (drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2).

- loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2.

- drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2.

- unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1.

- loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1.

- flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

- unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1.

Then, move t1 from l1_5 to l1_1 (drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1).

- loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1.

- drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1.

- unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2.

For p2 (l1_5, c1 to l2_4, c2):

- loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5. But wait, t1 is initially in l1_5. So before moving t1 for p1's steps, we can load p2 into t1.

But after that, we need to drive t1 to l1_1. So the steps for p2 would be:

- loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5.

- drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1.

- unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

- loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1.

- flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1.

- unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1.

- Now, use t2 (which is back in l2_1 after moving p1) to drive to l2_4.

- loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.

- drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2.

- unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4.

But this requires that after moving t2 for p1's steps, we return it to l2_1. Let's see:

The steps for p1 involving t2 are:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2.

2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2.

3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2.

4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1.

So after step 4, t2 is back in l2_1. Then, for p2's steps, after unloading p2 from a1 at l2_1 (step 6 for p2), we can use t2 to drive to l2_4.

So putting it all together, the plan would be interleaved:

But how to arrange the steps in the correct order without conflicts.

Let's try to sequence the steps:

For p2:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5.

2. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1. (Now t1 is in l1_1.)

3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

4. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1.

5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1.

For p1:

6. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2.

7. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2.

8. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2.

9. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1.

10. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1.

11. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

12. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1.

Then, for p1:

13. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1. Wait, but t1 is in l1_1 after step 2. But after step 2, we unloaded p2 in step 3, then t1 is still in l1_1. So after step 12, p1 is at l1_1, so we need to load it into t1.

Wait, after step 12, p1 is in l1_1 (unloaded from a2). t1 is in l1_1 (since step 2 moved it there). So:

13. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1.

14. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1.

15. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2.

For p2, after step 5 (fly a1 to l2_1):

16. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1.

17. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2. (t2 is in l2_1 after step 9.)

18. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1. Wait, no. After step 16, p2 is at l2_1. So to load it into t2, which is at l2_1:

17. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.

18. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2.

19. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4.

But wait, steps 6-9 involve t2 moving to l2_2 and back. After step 9, t2 is back in l2_1. So steps 17-19 can happen after step 9.

But let's check the order. Let's list all steps in order:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

2. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1

3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

4. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

6. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2

7. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

8. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2

9. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

10. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

11. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

12. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

13. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

14. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1

15. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2

16. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (Wait, when does this happen? After step 5, fly a1 to l2_1. So after step 5, need to unload p2 from a1 at l2_1. But step 5 is flyairplane a1 from l1_1 to l2_1. So after that, a1 is at l2_1. So step 16 would be unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1.

But when does this happen? Let's insert it after step 5.

So:

5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

6. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

7. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2

But then steps continue. Let's reorganize:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

2. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1

3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

4. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

6. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

7. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (But t2 is in l2_1 initially. Wait, after step 6, a1 is at l2_1, and p2 is in a1. After unloading, p2 is at l2_1. So step 6: unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1. Now p2 is at l2_1. Then, to move it to l2_4, load into t2 (which is in l2_1) and drive.

But in the meantime, steps for p1:

7. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2 (for p1)

But if we first handle p2's steps, then t2 is used for p1's steps. So maybe after unloading p2 at l2_1 (step 6), we need to load p2 into t2 and drive to l2_4. But t2 is being used for p1's steps (steps 7-10). So this would require that after t2 is used for p1, it is back in l2_1, then p2 can be loaded.

Alternatively, perhaps we need to do p2's steps after p1's steps with t2.

So the correct order would be:

For p1:

- Use t2 to move p1 to l2_1, then into a2, fly to l1_1.

For p2:

- Use t1 to move p2 to l1_1, fly to l2_1, then use t2 (after it's done with p1's steps) to move to l2_4.

So here's the full plan step by step:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 (p2 is in l1_5, t1 is there)

2. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1 (move t1 to airport)

3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (p2 now at l1_1)

4. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (a1 is at l1_1)

5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (a1 moves to l2_1)

6. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (p2 now at l2_1)

Now, for p1:

7. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2 (t2 is at l2_1)

8. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (p1 is loaded)

9. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 (return to airport)

10. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (p1 at l2_1)

11. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (a2 is at l2_1)

12. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (a2 flies to l1_1)

13. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (p1 at l1_1)

14. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1 (t1 is at l1_1 from step 2)

Wait, step 2 moved t1 to l1_1, and after unloading p2, t1 is still at l1_1. So step 14 is possible.

But wait, t1 is a truck, so after step 2, it's in l1_1. So steps 14 would be:

14. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (since p1 is there from step 13)

15. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1

16. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2

For p2, after step 6, p2 is at l2_1. Now, after step 10, t2 is back at l2_1. So:

17. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

18. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2

19. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

Putting it all together:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

2. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1

3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

4. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

6. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

7. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2

8. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

9. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2

10. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

11. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

12. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

13. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

14. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

15. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1

16. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2

17. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

18. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2

19. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

But wait, step 17: after step 10, t2 is at l2_1. So steps 7-10 involve t2 being moved and returned. Then step 17 can happen after step 10.

But step 6 unloads p2 at l2_1. So between steps 6 and 7, p2 is at l2_1. But steps 7-10 are for p1, moving t2. After step 10, t2 is back at l2_1, and p2 is still there. So then steps 17-19 can be done after step 10.

But in the plan above, steps 17-19 are after step 16. Which would be after p1 is delivered. But we can move them earlier.

Let's see:

After step 10 (unload p1 at l2_1), then steps 11-16 are for p1's flight and delivery. Meanwhile, p2 is already at l2_1. So after step 10, we can do steps for p2:

11. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

12. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2

13. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

Then proceed with p1's steps:

14. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

But wait, a2 is at l2_1 (initial location). So after step 13, t2 is at l2_4. But we need to use a2 to fly p1 to l1_1.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let's reorganize the steps to minimize the plan length.

Alternative approach:

For p1:

- Use t2 to get p1 to l2_1, load into a2, fly to l1_1, then use t1 (which is moved to l1_1 earlier by p2's steps) to deliver to l1_2.

For p2:

- Use t1 to move p2 to l1_1, load into a1, fly to l2_1, then use t2 to move to l2_4.

So steps:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

2. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1 (now t1 is at l1_1)

3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

4. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (now a1 is at l2_1)

6. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (p2 at l2_1)

7. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2 (t2 moves to l2_4)

8. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (Wait, no. p2 is at l2_1. t2 is at l2_4. Can't load. So need to load p2 into t2 while t2 is at l2_1.

So correct steps for p2 after step 6:

7. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (t2 is at l2_1)

8. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2

9. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

But t2 is used for p1's steps. So after handling p2's steps first:

But p1 is in l2_2. So steps for p1:

10. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2 (but after step 9, t2 is at l2_4. Can't do that. So this approach won't work.

This indicates that the two packages' plans are interdependent. So perhaps the optimal plan requires interleaving steps.

Alternative idea: process p1 first, then p2, but that may not be optimal.

Alternatively, use parallelism where possible.

Let me try to find a minimal step count.

Let's outline all necessary steps for each package:

For p1:

1. Drive t2 to l2_2.

2. Load p1.

3. Drive back to l2_1.

4. Unload.

5. Load into a2.

6. Fly to l1_1.

7. Unload.

8. Drive t1 to l1_1.

9. Load into t1.

10. Drive to l1_2.

11. Unload.

Total steps for p1: 11.

For p2:

1. Load into t1.

2. Drive to l1_1.

3. Unload.

4. Load into a1.

5. Fly to l2_1.

6. Unload.

7. Load into t2.

8. Drive to l2_4.

9. Unload.

Total steps for p2: 9.

But these sequences share steps when possible. For example, step 8 for p1 is driving t1 to l1_1, which is done in step 2 for p2. So combining these:

For example:

p2's step 1 and 2 are load and drive t1 to l1_1. Then p1's step 8 is not needed.

But we need to arrange the steps in a way that allows both packages to be handled.

Let's try to merge the steps:

For p2:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

2. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1

3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

4. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

6. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

7. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

8. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2

9. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

For p1:

A. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2 (But t2 is used in steps 7-9 for p2. So this would conflict. So need to do p1's steps first for t2.

So possible order:

Handle p1's steps involving t2 first, then p2's steps:

For p1:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2

2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2

4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

5. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

6. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

7. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

Then use t1 (which is moved to l1_1 for p2) to deliver p1.

But p2's steps need to use t1 to move to l1_1:

For p2:

8. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

9. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1

10. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

11. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

12. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

13. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

14. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (but t2 is at l2_1 after step 3)

15. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2

16. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

Then, after step 7, p1 is at l1_1. We need to load it into t1, which is at l1_1 after step 9.

So:

17. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

18. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1

19. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2

So this results in a total of 19 steps. But this isn't optimal. Let's see if we can find a shorter plan.

Alternative approach: can we use the airplanes for both packages in a way that reduces steps?

For example, after flying a1 to l2_1 with p2, a1 is there. Can we use a1 to fly back with another package? But there's no other package to move. Similarly, after a2 flies to l1_1, can it be used for something else? But it's not needed.

Another idea: when moving t1 to l1_1 for p2, it can then be used to transport p1 from l1_1 to l1_2. So after step 9 (drivetruck t1 to l1_1), p2 is unloaded, and t1 remains there. Then, after a2 arrives with p1 at l1_1 (step 7), we can load p1 into t1 and drive to l1_2.

So combining steps:

Plan:

For p2:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

2. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1

3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

4. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

6. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

For p1:

7. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2

8. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

9. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2

10. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

11. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

12. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

13. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

14. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

15. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1

16. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2

For p2:

17. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

18. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2

19. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

Total steps: 19. But can we do better?

Wait, after step 6, p2 is at l2_1. t2 is in l2_1 after step 10. So steps 17-19 can be done after step 10.

So reordering:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

2. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1

3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

4. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

6. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

7. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2

8. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

9. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2

10. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

11. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

12. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2

13. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

14. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

15. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

16. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

17. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

18. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1

19. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2

But step 14: after step 10, p1 is at l2_1. So step 14 loads p1 into a2 at l2_1, then fly to l1_1.

But in this case, steps 11-13 (for p2) happen before steps 14-19 (for p1). This would mean that after step 13, t2 is at l2_4, but step 14 requires a2 to be at l2_1, which it is. So this works.

But the order of steps might be adjusted to reduce the total number.

Wait, after step 10, p1 is at l2_1. So steps 11-13 move p2 to l2_4. Then steps 14-19 move p1 to l1_2. This would work.

But the total steps are 19. Is there a way to reduce this?

Another Idea: Can we fly a2 with p1 and a1 with p2 simultaneously? Yes, but it requires that their steps are interleaved.

Alternatively, after step 5 (fly a1 to l2_1), we can immediately fly a2 back, but not sure.

Alternatively, after step 13, t2 is at l2_4. But p1's steps require t2 to be at l2_1. So no.

Another approach: check if there's a way to have t1 handle both packages. But t1 is in c1 and can't go to c2.

Alternatively, after moving p2 to l2_1 via a1, use t2 to move p2 to l2_4 before handling p1's steps. But then t2 is busy.

So perhaps the minimal plan is 19 steps. But that seems long. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Wait, after step 5 (fly a1 to l2_1), a1 is at l2_1. p2 is there. So steps 6-9 for p2 can be done:

6. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

7. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

8. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2

9. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

This takes 4 steps. Then for p1:

10. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2 (But t2 is now at l2_4. Can't do this. So conflict.

Thus, must use t2 for p1 first, then for p2.

So the correct order is:

1. Move t2 for p1.

2. Move t2 back.

3. Unload p1.

4. Load into a2 and fly.

Then, after t2 is back, use it for p2.

So steps:

For p1:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2

2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2

4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

5. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

6. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

7. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

For p2:

8. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

9. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1

10. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

11. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

12. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

13. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

14. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

15. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2

16. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

For p1:

17. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (t1 is there from step 9)

18. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1

19. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2

Total steps: 19.

Is there a way to reduce steps? Let's see:

For example, after step 13 (unload p2 at l2_1), we can immediately load p2 into t2 (step 14) and drive to l2_4 (steps 15-16), but t2 is in l2_1 after step 3. So steps 14-16 can be done right after step 4.

So:

Steps 1-4: p1's steps with t2.

Steps 5-7: p1's steps with a2 and t1.

Wait, no. After step 4, p1 is at l2_1. Then steps 5-7 load into a2 and fly.

But steps for p2 can be done in parallel.

Wait, after step 4, p1 is at l2_1. Then steps for p2:

8. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

9. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1

10. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

11. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

12. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

13. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

14. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

15. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2

16. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

Meanwhile, for p1:

5. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

6. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

7. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

Then, after step 9, t1 is at l1_1. So:

17. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

18. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1

19. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2

Total steps: 19.

But perhaps some steps can be done in parallel. For example, steps for p2's truck movement can be done while the airplane is flying.

But the problem requires a sequential plan. So I think this 19-step plan is necessary. However, maybe there's a shorter way.

Wait, what if we move p2 first, then use a1 to fly back with p1? But p1 is in c2.

Alternatively, perhaps after moving p2 to l2_1, use a1 to fly back to c1 with p1. But p1 is in c2.

Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, after p2 is at l2_1, can we use a2 (which is initially at l2_1) to fly p2 to l2_4? No, airplanes can only fly between airports. l2_4 is not an airport. Airplanes can only land at airports. So airplanes can't fly to non-airport locations. So for p2 to reach l2_4, it must go via truck.

Thus, the steps seem necessary.

But wait, the airports are l1_1 and l2_1. So airplanes can only fly between these two. So a1 is initially at l1_1, a2 at l2_1.

So to move p1 from l2_2 to l1_2:

- Use truck t2 to move p1 to l2_1 (airport).

- Load into a2.

- Fly to l1_1.

- Use truck t1 to move to l1_2.

For p2:

- Use truck t1 to move to l1_1.

- Load into a1.

- Fly to l2_1.

- Use truck t2 to move to l2_4.

So the minimal steps would be:

For p1:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2

2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2

4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

5. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

6. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

7. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

8. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1 (t1 is initially at l1_5)

9. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

10. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1

11. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2

For p2:

12. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 (But t1 is moved to l1_1 in step 8. So this has to happen before step 8.

Thus, steps need to be:

For p2:

a. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

b. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1

c. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

d. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

e. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

f. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

g. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

h. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2

i. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

But steps a and b must happen before step 8 (drivetruck t1 to l1_1 for p1). So the plan would be:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

2. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1

3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

4. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

6. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

7. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

8. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2

9. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

Then for p1:

10. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2 (But t2 is at l2_4 after step 9. Impossible.)

Thus, this approach doesn't work.

Therefore, the correct order must involve using t2 for p1 first, then for p2.

Thus, the plan must be:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2 (p1's step)

2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2

4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

5. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

6. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

7. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

8. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

9. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1

10. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

11. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

12. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

13. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

14. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

15. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2

16. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

17. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

18. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1

19. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2

This seems to be the minimal steps possible. So this is a 19-step plan. But is there a shorter way?

Wait, after step 7 (unload p1 at l1_1), t1 is already at l1_1 (from step 9). So steps 17-19 can be:

17. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (t1 is there)

18. drive to l1_2

19. unload

So steps are correct.

But maybe we can interleave steps to reduce the count.

For example, after step 8 (load p2 into t1), then step 9 (drive t1 to l1_1), then steps for p1 can use t1 after it's at l1_1.

But it's difficult to find a shorter plan. I think this 19-step plan is the optimal.
