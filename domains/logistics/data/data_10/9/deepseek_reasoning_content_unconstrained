Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. So, the goal is to get package p1 to l2_3 and p2 to l1_4. Let me start by understanding the initial state and the available actions.

First, the initial locations: p1 is in l1_5 (city c1), and p2 is in l2_2 (city c2). The trucks and airplanes are in certain locations too. Trucks can move within their city, and airplanes can fly between airports. Airports are l1_1 (c1) and l2_1 (c2).

So, to move packages between cities, I probably need to use airplanes. Let's see. For p1 to get to c2's l2_3, which is in city c2. Since l2_3 is a city c2 location, a truck in c2 can drive there. Similarly, p2 needs to go to l1_4 in c1, which would require a truck in c1.

Let's break down each package's journey:

For p1 (l1_5 â†’ l2_3):
- Move p1 from l1_5 to a truck in c1. The truck t1 is in l1_4. Wait, no. The initial state says "Package t1 is in location l1_4". Wait, wait, that's a typo? Because t1 is a truck. Oh, the original state probably has a typo. Let me check again.

Wait, looking back: The original state says "Package t1 is in location l1_4". That must be a mistake. Because t1 is a truck, not a package. So perhaps that's a misstatement. Maybe it should be "Truck t1 is in location l1_4". Similarly for t2. Because otherwise, the problem is impossible. Because trucks can't be loaded if they are packages. So I think that's an error in the problem description. Assuming that "Package t1..." is a typo and should be "Truck t1...". Otherwise, the problem is unsolvable. Let's proceed under that assumption.

So assuming that:
- Truck t1 is in l1_4 (city c1)
- Truck t2 is in l2_5 (city c2)
- Airplane a1 is in l1_1 (c1's airport)
- Airplane a2 is in l2_1 (c2's airport)

Packages:
- p1 in l1_5 (c1)
- p2 in l2_2 (c2)

Now, the plan for p1:
1. Get p1 from l1_5 to an airport in c1 (l1_1) using truck t1. But wait, t1 is in l1_4. So first, drive t1 to l1_5? Wait, but l1_5 is in c1. So truck t1 can drive there. Then load p1 into t1, drive to l1_1 (the airport), unload p1, load into airplane a1, fly to l2_1 (c2's airport), unload into a2 (wait, no, airplane a2 is in l2_1 initially. Wait, but we can fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1. Then unload p1 into l2_1, then load into truck t2 (but t2 is in l2_5). Wait, no. Let's think again.

Alternatively, maybe use airplane a1 to carry p1 from c1 to c2. So steps for p1:

- Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_5. Then load p1 into t1. Then drive t1 to l1_1 (the airport in c1). Unload p1 at l1_1. Then load p1 into airplane a1. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1 (c2's airport). Then unload p1 at l2_1. Then load p1 into truck t2 (but where is t2? If t2 is in l2_5, we need to drive t2 to l2_1. But can trucks move to airports? Yes, if the airport is a location in their city. Since l2_1 is in c2, and t2 is in c2. So drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1. Then load p1 into t2, drive to l2_3, and unload.

Wait, but initial position of t2 is l2_5. So steps for p1:

1. Drive t1 (c1's truck) from l1_4 to l1_5 (where p1 is). Then load p1 into t1.
2. Drive t1 to l1_1 (airport in c1). Unload p1 at l1_1.
3. Load p1 into airplane a1 (which is at l1_1).
4. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1 (airport in c2).
5. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1.
6. Now, need to get p1 to l2_3. So use truck t2 (which is in l2_5). Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (airport). Load p1 into t2. Then drive t2 to l2_3. Unload p1 there.

Similarly for p2: it needs to go from l2_2 (c2) to l1_4 (c1). So:

1. Use truck t2 (in l2_5) to drive to l2_2. Load p2 into t2.
2. Drive t2 to l2_1 (airport). Unload p2 there.
3. Load p2 into airplane a2 (which is at l2_1). Fly a2 to l1_1 (c1's airport).
4. Unload p2 at l1_1. Then use truck t1 (in c1) to drive to l1_1, load p2, drive to l1_4, and unload.

But wait, the initial position of t1 is l1_4. So after moving t1 to l1_5 and then to l1_1 for p1, then after that, t1 is in l1_1. So for p2's part, after flying a2 to l1_1, p2 is there. Then t1 would need to be in l1_1 to load p2. Let's check the order of actions.

Wait, but the two packages' plans can be interleaved. Let's see.

Wait, but the problem is to get both packages to their destinations. So the plan needs to handle both. Let's think of the sequence step by step.

Let me outline the steps for p1 first, then p2, but need to make sure that the trucks and airplanes are where they need to be.

But perhaps there's a way to parallelize or optimize. Let's see.

Plan for p1:

1. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_5. (drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1)
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
3. Drive t1 to l1_1. (drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1)
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
5. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
6. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
7. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
8. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1. (drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2)
9. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
10. Drive t2 to l2_3. (drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2)
11. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

For p2:

a. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2. But wait, t2 is initially at l2_5. But in the steps for p1, step 8 is driving t2 from l2_5 to l2_1. So if we do that first, then t2 is in l2_1, but p2 is in l2_2. So maybe the p2 steps need to happen before moving t2 for p1.

Wait, that's a conflict. Because to move p2, we need t2 to go to l2_2 (where p2 is) first.

So perhaps the order should be:

First handle p2's initial steps, then p1's, but that might complicate the plan.

Alternatively, find a way to handle both packages with minimal steps.

Let me think again.

p1 is in c1, needs to go to c2's l2_3.

p2 is in c2, needs to go to c1's l1_4.

So the plan would involve both airplanes.

For p1:

- Use t1 in c1 to move p1 to l1_1 (airport), load into a1, fly to l2_1, unload, then use t2 in c2 to take to l2_3.

For p2:

- Use t2 in c2 to take p2 to l2_1 (airport), load into a2, fly to l1_1, unload, then use t1 in c1 to take to l1_4.

But t1 is initially in l1_4. So for p2's part, after a2 arrives at l1_1, t1 needs to be there to load p2. But where is t1 after handling p1?

In the steps for p1, t1 is driven from l1_4 to l1_5, then to l1_1. So after step 3, t1 is in l1_1, unloaded p1. Then, after p1 is loaded into a1, t1 is still in l1_1. So after that, t1 can be used to transport p2 from l1_1 to l1_4.

But for p2, after being flown to l1_1, t1 can load it and drive to l1_4.

So the overall steps would be:

For p1:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
3. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
5. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
6. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
7. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
8. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
9. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
10. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
11. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

For p2:

A. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2 (Wait, but t2 is initially in l2_5. So for p2, first steps are to drive t2 to l2_2, load p2, drive to l2_1, load into a2, fly to l1_1, then use t1 to take to l1_4.

But the problem is that in the p1 steps, t2 is being used to move p1 from l2_1 to l2_3. So the steps for p2 would need to happen before step 8 of p1's plan.

Alternatively, perhaps interleave the steps.

So let's outline the entire plan step by step.

First, handle moving p2 to its airport:

1. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2 (where p2 is). drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
3. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1 (airport). drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
5. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
6. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
7. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

Now, to get p2 from l1_1 to l1_4:

8. Use t1, which is initially at l1_4. Wait, but in the p1 steps, we have to move t1. So perhaps after handling p2's flight, but before moving t1 for p1.

Wait, but the initial position of t1 is l1_4. So for p2:

After step 7, p2 is at l1_1. To get it to l1_4, we need t1 to be at l1_1. But initially, t1 is at l1_4. So we need to drive t1 to l1_1 to pick up p2, then drive back to l1_4.

But that would add steps. Alternatively, perhaps after handling p1's movement, use t1 to move p2.

Wait, this is getting complex. Let's try to sequence the steps properly.

Let me try to structure the plan:

For p1:

- t1 starts at l1_4. Drive to l1_5 (p1's location), load, drive to l1_1, unload. Then fly to l2_1, then use t2 to take to l2_3.

For p2:

- t2 starts at l2_5. Drive to l2_2 (p2's location), load, drive to l2_1, unload. Fly to l1_1, then use t1 to take to l1_4.

But t1 is needed for both p1 and p2. So the sequence must be such that after t1 is used for p1, it's available to take p2 from l1_1 to l1_4.

Wait, but after moving p1 to l1_1 (step 4), t1 is at l1_1. Then after unloading p1, t1 remains there. So after p2 arrives at l1_1 (step 7), t1 can load p2 and drive to l1_4.

So the steps would be:

For p1:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
3. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
5. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
6. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
7. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
8. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 (t2 moves to l2_1 to pick up p1)
9. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
10. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
11. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

For p2:

A. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2 (But wait, t2 is initially at l2_5. So if we first use t2 to handle p2, then we can't use it for p1. Wait, this is conflicting. Because after step A, t2 would be at l2_2, but for p1's steps, we need t2 to be at l2_1. So perhaps the steps need to be ordered such that p2's steps are done before p1's steps that use t2.

Wait, but the problem is that both packages require the use of t2. So the plan needs to sequence the use of t2 for both.

Alternatively, maybe use the airplane a2 for p2 first, then handle p1. Let's try:

Plan steps:

For p2:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2 (t2 goes to p2's location)
2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 (to airport)
4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
5. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
6. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
7. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
8. Now, need to get p2 to l1_4. But t1 is initially at l1_4. So drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1:
8. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
9. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
10. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
11. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

For p1:

12. But now, t1 is at l1_4 again. So drive t1 to l1_5 to pick up p1:
12. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1
13. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
14. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
15. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
16. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
17. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
18. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
19. Now, t2 is at l2_1 (from step 3). Wait, step 3 ends with t2 at l2_1. But step 4 unloads p2 there, and step 5-6 fly a2 to l1_1. So after step 3, t2 is at l2_1. Then after step 4, t2 is still there. So for p1's steps, after step 18, p1 is at l2_1. So we can drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_3:
19. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
20. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3? No, p1 is at l2_1. Wait, after step 18, p1 is unloaded from a1 at l2_1. So t2 is at l2_1. So load p1 into t2:

19. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
20. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
21. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

But wait, after step 3, t2 was at l2_1. Then step 4 is unloading p2 there, but t2 remains at l2_1. Then steps 5-7 involve a2. Then step 8: t1 is driven to l1_1. So after step 4, t2 is at l2_1. So for p1, after step 18 (unload p1 at l2_1), t2 is already there. So steps 19-21 can be done.

But this plan has 21 steps. Is there a way to optimize?

Wait, let's count steps again.

For p2:

1. drive t2 to l2_2 (from l2_5)
2. load p2 into t2
3. drive t2 to l2_1
4. unload p2 at l2_1
5. load into a2
6. fly a2 to l1_1
7. unload p2 at l1_1
8. drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1
9. load p2 into t1
10. drive t1 back to l1_4
11. unload p2

For p1:

12. drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_5
13. load p1
14. drive to l1_1
15. unload p1
16. load into a1
17. fly to l2_1
18. unload p1
19. load into t2 (which is at l2_1)
20. drive t2 to l2_3
21. unload p1

But is this the optimal plan? Let's see. Are there redundant steps?

For example, after step 10, t1 is at l1_4. Then step 12 is driving t1 from l1_4 to l1_5. That's necessary. But maybe there's a way to combine steps.

Alternatively, maybe after handling p2's delivery, use t1 to handle p1 without returning to l1_4. Let me see.

Wait, after step 10, t1 is at l1_4 (after delivering p2). So step 12 is driving from l1_4 to l1_5 (which is where p1 is). So that's necessary.

But can we reorder steps to avoid some back and forth?

Alternatively, perhaps after delivering p2 to l1_4, t1 is already there, so no need to move again. But p1 is in l1_5. So t1 needs to go from l1_4 to l1_5, load p1, drive to l1_1, etc.

Alternatively, can we handle both packages using the same airplanes or trucks more efficiently?

Alternatively, use a different airplane. For example, fly a2 to l1_1 with p2, then fly a2 back with p1. But that might not be necessary.

Alternatively, after a2 delivers p2 to l1_1, perhaps a1 can fly back. But not sure.

Alternatively, after a1 flies to l2_1, can it fly back? But for the problem, we don't need that.

Wait, the steps for p1 and p2 can be interleaved. Maybe we can do some steps in parallel where possible. But since the problem requires a sequential plan, perhaps we can find a shorter path.

Let me think again. The plan I outlined has 21 steps. But maybe there's a shorter way.

Alternative approach: Since both packages need to cross cities, use airplanes. For p1, from c1 to c2 via a1. For p2, from c2 to c1 via a2.

But for p1's case:

- t1 moves from l1_4 to l1_5 (load p1), then to l1_1 (airport), unload, fly to l2_1, then t2 (which is initially at l2_5) needs to go to l2_1 to load p1 and take to l2_3.

For p2:

- t2 moves from l2_5 to l2_2 (load p2), to l2_1 (airport), unload, fly to l1_1, then t1 (after delivering p1's steps) can take p2 to l1_4.

Wait, but if we arrange the steps such that after a2 flies to l1_1, t1 is already at l1_1 (from delivering p1 to the airport). So perhaps:

Here's a possible sequence:

1. Drive t1 to l1_5, load p1, drive to l1_1, unload. (steps 1-4)
2. Drive t2 to l2_2, load p2, drive to l2_1, unload. (steps 5-8)
3. Load p1 into a1, fly to l2_1. (steps 9-10)
4. Load p2 into a2, fly to l1_1. (steps 11-12)
5. Now, p1 is at l2_1, and p2 is at l1_1.
6. For p1: Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_3, load p1 from l2_1, drive to l2_3, unload. (but t2 is at l2_1 after step 8)
Wait, after step 8, t2 is at l2_1. So after step 10, p1 is at l2_1. So steps for p1:

10. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 (after fly)
11. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (t2 is there)
12. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
13. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

For p2:

14. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (after fly)
15. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (t1 is at l1_1 from step 4)
16. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
17. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

So total steps would be:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
3. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
5. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
6. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
7. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
8. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
9. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
10. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
11. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
12. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
13. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
14. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
15. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
16. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
17. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
18. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
19. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
20. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

Wait, but steps 12 and 13: loading p2 into a2 at l2_1 and flying to l1_1.

But p2 was unloaded at l2_1 in step 8. So step 12 is loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1.

Then step 13: fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.

Then step 14: unload p2 at l1_1.

Then steps 18-20: load into t1 (which is at l1_1 from step 3), drive to l1_4.

This totals 20 steps. Is this correct? Let's check if all preconditions are met.

For example, after step 3, t1 is at l1_1. So step 18: loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 requires p2 to be at l1_1 (after step 14), and t1 is there.

Yes. Then drive to l1_4 and unload.

This seems correct. But what about the airplane a2's initial position? Initially, a2 is at l2_1. So step 12: loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 is possible because a2 is there. Then fly to l1_1.

Yes.

But wait, step 5-8: t2 starts at l2_5, drives to l2_2, loads p2, drives to l2_1, unloads p2. So p2 is at l2_1. Then step 12: load into a2 (which is at l2_1). Then fly to l1_1.

Yes.

Now, the steps for p1:

Steps 1-4: t1 takes p1 to l1_1, unloaded. Then step 9: load into a1 (which is initially at l1_1). Then fly to l2_1. Unload. Then load into t2 (step 15), drive to l2_3.

Yes.

So this plan has 20 steps. But maybe there's a way to reduce it further.

Wait, when t2 is used to load p2 and then after that, to load p1. Let's see.

After step 8, t2 is at l2_1, having unloaded p2 there. Then, after step 11, p1 is also at l2_1. So steps 15-17: load p1 into t2, drive to l2_3, unload.

Yes.

But wait, between steps 8 and 12, there's a gap. Let's see:

After step 8: p2 is at l2_1, t2 is at l2_1.

Step 12: load p2 into a2 (which is at l2_1).

Yes.

So the plan is valid.

But is there a way to combine steps?

For example, after step 8 (unload p2 at l2_1), can we immediately load it into a2 (step 12), and fly to l1_1 (step 13). Then, after unloading (step 14), load into t1 (step 18).

But t1 is at l1_1 from step 3.

Yes.

So the plan seems valid.

But let's count the steps again:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
3. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
5. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
6. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
7. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
8. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
9. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
10. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
11. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
12. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
13. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
14. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
15. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
16. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
17. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
18. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
19. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
20. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

This totals 20 steps. But perhaps steps can be reordered to reduce the number.

Wait, after step 9 (load p1 into a1), we can immediately fly a1 (step 10). Then, during the time a1 is flying, we can handle some other steps. But since actions are sequential, we can't do that.

Alternatively, can we interleave the loading of p2 into a2 with the steps for p1?

For example, after step 8 (unload p2 at l2_1), steps 12 and 13 can be done before steps 9-11. But would that help?

If we load p2 into a2 and fly to l1_1 before handling p1's flight, then p2 arrives earlier. But t1 is already at l1_1 (from step 3). So perhaps:

After step 8 (unload p2 at l2_1):

12. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
13. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
14. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
15. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
16. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
17. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

Then proceed with p1's steps:

9. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
10. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
11. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
18. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
19. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
20. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

But this totals 20 steps as well. But the order of steps is different. However, this might be more efficient in terms of when actions are taken, but the total number of steps remains the same.

So perhaps 20 steps is the minimum. But maybe there's a smarter way.

Wait, let's see: after step 3, t1 is at l1_1. Then after step 4, p1 is unloaded there. Then steps 9-11 are for flying p1 to l2_1. Then steps 15-17: load into t2 and drive.

But during that time, after step 8, p2 is at l2_1. Then steps 12-14: fly p2 to l1_1, then steps 18-20: load into t1 and drive.

But perhaps there's a way to load p2 into a2 before p1 is loaded into a1. For example:

After step 8 (unload p2 at l2_1):

12. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
13. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
14. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
15. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
16. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
17. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

Meanwhile, for p1:

9. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (after step 4)
10. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
11. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
18. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
19. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
20. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

This still totals 20 steps. So no reduction.

Wait, but maybe after step 3, t1 is at l1_1. Then, after step 16, t1 is at l1_4. Then step 17 unloads p2. So the steps for p2 are completed. Then, to handle p1's initial steps, we need to move t1 again from l1_4 to l1_5. Wait, no. Because steps 1-3 for p1 are before steps for p2's flight. So in this ordering, after step 17 (p2 delivered), we have to go back to steps 9-11 for p1's flight.

But in this case, the steps are:

1. t1 to l1_5, load p1, drive to l1_1, unload.
5. t2 to l2_2, load p2, drive to l2_1, unload.
12. load p2 into a2, fly to l1_1, unload.
15. load p2 into t1, drive to l1_4, unload.
9. load p1 into a1, fly to l2_1, unload.
18. load p1 into t2, drive to l2_3, unload.

This seems correct. So the total steps are 20.

Is there a way to reduce steps by combining actions?

Wait, perhaps after step 7 (t2 arrives at l2_1), we can immediately load p2 into a2 and fly, while also loading p1 into a1 and flying. But since actions are sequential, they have to be ordered.

Alternatively, after unloading p1 at l1_1 (step 4), and unloading p2 at l2_1 (step 8), we can parallelize the airplane flights. But in the plan, we have to sequence them.

Alternatively, use a different airplane for one of the packages. But there's a1 and a2. So each can handle one package.

Hmm. I think this is the optimal plan. 20 steps. But let's check if any steps can be merged or removed.

Wait, after step 3, t1 is at l1_1. After step 16, t1 is at l1_4 (delivering p2). Then, to handle p1's journey, do we need to move t1 again? No, because p1 is already handled by a1 and t2.

Wait, no. After step 4, p1 is unloaded at l1_1. Then steps 9-11: load into a1, fly to l2_1, unload. Then steps 18-20: load into t2 and deliver. So t1 isn't involved in p1's journey after step 4.

So the steps are correct.

Therefore, the final plan has 20 actions. But I need to check if this is the minimal possible.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to have fewer steps. For example, after delivering p2 to l1_1 via a2, maybe t1 can be used to deliver both p2 and p1. But no, p1 is handled by a different city's truck.

Alternatively, maybe the steps can be reordered to save some movements. For example, if t2 is used to carry both p1 and p2 in different steps. But since they are in different cities, probably not.

Another approach: Check for each package the minimal steps required.

For p1:

- Move from l1_5 to l1_1 via truck (3 steps: drive, load, drive, unload).
- Fly to l2_1 (2 steps: load, fly, unload).
- Then truck to l2_3 (3 steps: drive, load, drive, unload). Total 3+3+3=9 steps.

Wait, no. Breaking down:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 (1)
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 (2)
3. drivetruck l1_5 l1_1 (3)
4. unloadtruck p1 l1_1 (4)
5. loadairplane a1 l1_1 (5)
6. fly to l2_1 (6)
7. unload (7)
8. drive t2 to l2_1 (8)
9. loadtruck p1 t2 (9)
10. drive to l2_3 (10)
11. unload (11)

That's 11 steps for p1.

For p2:

1. drive t2 l2_5 l2_2 (12)
2. load (13)
3. drive to l2_1 (14)
4. unload (15)
5. load into a2 (16)
6. fly to l1_1 (17)
7. unload (18)
8. drive t1 to l1_1 (19)
9. load (20)
10. drive to l1_4 (21)
11. unload (22)

So total 22 steps. But the previous plan had 20 steps by interleaving.

Wait, but in the previous plan, steps 18-20 for p2 are done after p1's steps. So maybe overlapping steps reduce the total count.

But I'm not sure. The previous plan with 20 steps seems to be the minimal.

Wait, perhaps there's a way to avoid driving t1 back to l1_4. For example, after delivering p2 to l1_4, can t1 stay there? But p1 is already handled by then.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial drive of t1 is necessary. I think the 20-step plan is the optimal.
