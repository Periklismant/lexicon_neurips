Let me first go through the problem description to understand it clearly.

We have a logistics problem with:
- Cities, each with multiple locations including exactly one airport
- Trucks, which can move between locations within the same city
- Airplanes, which can move between airports
- Packages, which need to be transported to specific locations

The available actions are:
1. loadtruck p t l: Load package p in truck t at location l
2. loadairplane p ap l: Load package p in airplane ap at location l
3. unloadtruck p t l: Unload package p from truck t at location l
4. unloadairplane p ap l: Unload package p from airplane ap at location l
5. drivetruck t l_from l_to c: Drive truck t from location l_from to l_to within city c
6. flyairplane ap l_from l_to: Fly airplane ap from location l_from to l_to

Let me check the initial state:
- Locations l1_1 through l1_5 are in city c1
- Locations l2_1 through l2_5 are in city c2
- l1_1 and l2_1 are airports
- Wait, there seems to be a mistake in the initial state. It says "Package t1 is in location l1_4" and "Package t2 is in location l2_5", but t1 and t2 should be trucks, not packages.
- Similarly, it says "Package a1 is in location l1_1" and "Package a2 is in location l2_1", but a1 and a2 should be airplanes.

Let me assume the correct initial state is:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_4
- Truck t2 is in location l2_5
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1
- Package p1 is in location l1_5
- Package p2 is in location l2_2

The goal is to have:
- Package p1 in location l2_3
- Package p2 in location l1_4

I need to come up with a valid plan to achieve this goal.

For package p1, which is currently at l1_5 in city c1 and needs to go to l2_3 in city c2:
1. We need a truck to pick it up from l1_5 and take it to the airport l1_1
2. Then an airplane to fly it from airport l1_1 to airport l2_1
3. Finally, a truck to take it from airport l2_1 to l2_3

For package p2, which is currently at l2_2 in city c2 and needs to go to l1_4 in city c1:
1. We need a truck to pick it up from l2_2 and take it to the airport l2_1
2. Then an airplane to fly it from airport l2_1 to airport l1_1
3. Finally, a truck to take it from airport l1_1 to l1_4

Let's start planning:

For package p1 (l1_5 to l2_3):
1. We have truck t1 at l1_4, so we need to drive it to l1_5:
   - drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1
2. Load p1 onto t1:
   - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
3. Drive t1 to the airport l1_1:
   - drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
4. Unload p1 from t1 at the airport:
   - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
5. Load p1 onto airplane a1:
   - loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
6. Fly a1 to airport l2_1:
   - flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
7. Unload p1 from a1:
   - unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
8. We have truck t2 at l2_5, so we need to drive it to l2_1:
   - drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
9. Load p1 onto t2:
   - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
10. Drive t2 to the destination l2_3:
    - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
11. Unload p1 from t2:
    - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

For package p2 (l2_2 to l1_4):
1. We need to drive truck t2 from l2_3 to l2_2:
   - drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2
2. Load p2 onto t2:
   - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
3. Drive t2 to the airport l2_1:
   - drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
4. Unload p2 from t2:
   - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
5. Load p2 onto airplane a1 (which is at l2_1 after flying there with p1):
   - loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
6. Fly a1 back to airport l1_1:
   - flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
7. Unload p2 from a1:
   - unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
8. We need to drive truck t1 from l1_1 to l1_4:
   - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
9. Load p2 onto t1:
   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
10. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_4:
    - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

Actually, I noticed an issue with step 9 for package p2. We're loading p2 onto t1 at l1_4, but p2 is at l1_1 at that point. Let me correct this:

8. We need to drive truck t1 from l1_1 to l1_4:
   - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
9. Drive t1 back to l1_1:
   - drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
10. Load p2 onto t1:
    - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
11. Drive t1 to l1_4:
    - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
12. Unload p2 from t1:
    - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

But this seems inefficient. Let me rethink the entire plan to make it more optimal.

Actually, let's be more systematic. I'll plan the optimal route for each package separately, then combine them, using the available trucks and airplanes.

For package p1 (l1_5 to l2_3):
1. Use truck t1 to move p1 from l1_5 to airport l1_1
2. Use airplane a1 to move p1 from airport l1_1 to airport l2_1
3. Use truck t2 to move p1 from airport l2_1 to l2_3

For package p2 (l2_2 to l1_4):
1. Use truck t2 to move p2 from l2_2 to airport l2_1
2. Use airplane a1 (or a2) to move p2 from airport l2_1 to airport l1_1
3. Use truck t1 to move p1 from airport l1_1 to l1_4

Let's create the detailed plan:

For package p1:
1. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1 (move truck t1 to package p1)
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 (load p1 onto t1)
3. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1 (move t1 with p1 to airport)
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (unload p1 at airport)
5. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (load p1 onto airplane)
6. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (fly a1 with p1 to destination airport)
7. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 (unload p1 at destination airport)
8. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 (move truck t2 to airport to pick up p1)
9. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (load p1 onto t2)
10. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2 (move t2 with p1 to destination)
11. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (unload p1 at destination)

For package p2:
12. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2 (move truck t2 to package p2)
13. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (load p2 onto t2)
14. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 (move t2 with p2 to airport)
15. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (unload p2 at airport)
16. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (load p2 onto airplane)
17. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1 (fly a1 with p2 to destination airport)
18. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (unload p2 at destination airport)
19. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1 (move truck t1 to carry p2 to destination)
20. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (load p2 onto t1)
21. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1 (move t1 with p2 to destination)
22. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (unload p2 at destination)

Let me double-check this plan to make sure it's valid and optimal:

- We use truck t1 for the first leg of p1's journey and the last leg of p2's journey.
- We use truck t2 for the last leg of p1's journey and the first leg of p2's journey.
- We use airplane a1 for both p1 and p2, flying first from l1_1 to l2_1 and then back.

I think this plan is optimal because:
- Each package is handled by a truck within its starting city, then by an airplane between airports, and finally by a truck in its destination city.
- We minimize the number of truck movements, only driving trucks to locations where packages need to be picked up or dropped off.

Let me review it once more to ensure the sequence is correct and there are no additional optimizations:

1. We start with t1 at l1_4, t2 at l2_5, a1 at l1_1, a2 at l2_1, p1 at l1_5, and p2 at l2_2.
2. We use t1 to pick up p1 from l1_5 and take it to airport l1_1.
3. We use a1 to fly p1 from airport l1_1 to airport l2_1.
4. We use t2 to pick up p1 from airport l2_1 and take it to l2_3.
5. We use t2 to pick up p2 from l2_2 and take it to airport l2_1.
6. We use a1 to fly p2 from airport l2_1 to airport l1_1.
7. We use t1 to pick up p2 from airport l1_1 and take it to l1_4.

The 22-step plan I detailed above should accomplish this efficiently. However, I can think of a minor optimization: since we're not using a2, we could potentially use it to transport one of the packages instead of having a1 fly back and forth. Let me see if this can save steps:

If we use a2 to fly p2 from l2_1 to l1_1, we would avoid having to wait for a1 to fly back, which could allow the two packages to be transported in parallel. However, a1 is already at l1_1 initially, and a2 is at l2_1. So using a2 for p2 would actually be more efficient than using a1 for p2.

Let me revise the plan:

For package p1:
1. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1 (move truck t1 to package p1)
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 (load p1 onto t1)
3. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1 (move t1 with p1 to airport)
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (unload p1 at airport)
5. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (load p1 onto airplane a1)
6. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (fly a1 with p1 to destination airport)
7. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 (unload p1 at destination airport)
8. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 (move truck t2 to airport to pick up p1)
9. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (load p1 onto t2)
10. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2 (move t2 with p1 to destination)
11. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (unload p1 at final destination)

For package p2:
12. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2 (move truck t2 to package p2)
13. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (load p2 onto t2)
14. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 (move t2 with p2 to airport)
15. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (unload p2 at airport)
16. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (load p2 onto airplane a2, which is already at l2_1)
17. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (fly a2 with p2 to destination airport)
18. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (unload p2 at destination airport)
19. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1 (move truck t1 to carry p2 to final destination)
20. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (load p2 onto t1)
21. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1 (move t1 with p2 to destination)
22. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (unload p2 at final destination)

This plan uses both airplanes more efficiently. a1 is used to fly p1 from l1_1 to l2_1, and a2 is used to fly p2 from l2_1 to l1_1, avoiding having to fly the same airplane back and forth.

But let me check if I can optimize it further. Are there any steps that can be parallelized or eliminated? Let's reconsider the whole plan.

One possible optimization is to avoid moving trucks back and forth if possible. For example, if we can load multiple packages onto a truck or airplane in a single trip, that would be more efficient.

However, in this case, the packages start and end at different locations, so we need separate trips for each. Furthermore, packages p1 and p2 need to be transported in opposite directions, so we can't combine their transportation into a single trip.

One small optimization might be possible: after dropping off p1 at l2_3, truck t2 immediately goes to pick up p2 at l2_2. We could potentially have truck t2 pick up p2 first, then go to the airport to pick up p1, then drop off each package at its destination. Let me see if this would save steps:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1 (move truck t1 to package p1)
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 (load p1 onto t1)
3. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1 (move t1 with p1 to airport)
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (unload p1 at airport)
5. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (load p1 onto airplane a1)
6. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (fly a1 with p1 to destination airport)
7. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 (unload p1 at destination airport)
8. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2 (move truck t2 to pick up p2)
9. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (load p2 onto t2)
10. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 (move t2 with p2 to airport)
11. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (unload p2 at airport)
12. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (load p2 onto airplane a2)
13. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (load p1 onto t2)
14. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2 (move t2 with p1 to its destination)
15. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (unload p1 at its final destination)
16. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (fly a2 with p2 to destination airport)
17. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (unload p2 at destination airport)
18. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1 (move truck t1 to carry p2 to final destination)
19. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (load p2 onto t1)
20. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1 (move t1 with p2 to destination)
21. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (unload p2 at final destination)

Actually, this doesn't save steps. In fact, it introduces additional sequences that might not be allowed (such as loading two packages onto a truck t2).

I think the previous plan (with 22 steps) is the optimal solution for this problem.

Let me go through it once more to make sure everything aligns:

For package p1:
1. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1 (move truck t1 to package p1)
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 (load p1 onto t1)
3. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1 (move t1 with p1 to airport)
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (unload p1 at airport)
5. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (load p1 onto airplane a1)
6. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (fly a1 with p1 to destination airport)
7. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 (unload p1 at destination airport)
8. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 (move truck t2 to airport to pick up p1)
9. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (load p1 onto t2)
10. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2 (move t2 with p1 to destination)
11. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (unload p1 at final destination)

For package p2:
12. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2 (move truck t2 to package p2)
13. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (load p2 onto t2)
14. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 (move t2 with p2 to airport)
15. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (unload p2 at airport)
16. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (load p2 onto airplane a2, which is already at l2_1)
17. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (fly a2 with p2 to destination airport)
18. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (unload p2 at destination airport)
19. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1 (move truck t1 to carry p2 to final destination)
20. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (load p2 onto t1)
21. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1 (move t1 with p2 to destination)
22. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (unload p2 at final destination)

This looks like an optimal and valid solution. The 22-step plan transports both packages to their destinations using the available trucks and airplanes in an efficient manner.

Actually, I mentioned that the initial state might have errors, labeling trucks and airplanes as packages. Let me double check the correct initial state:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_4
- Truck t2 is in location l2_5
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (airport in city c1)
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1 (airport in city c2)
- Package p1 is in location l1_5
- Package p2 is in location l2_2

I'll give the final solution one more check based on this initial state.

1. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
3. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
5. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
6. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
7. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
8. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
9. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
10. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
11. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
12. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2
13. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
14. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
15. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
16. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
17. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
18. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
19. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
20. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
21. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
22. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

This solution seems perfectly valid to me, and I believe it is optimal given the constraints.

Wait, I just realized I can trim off a trivial step. Step 19 involves driving truck t1 from l1_1 to l1_4, but then in step 20, we immediately load package p2 onto t1 at l1_1. This is logically inconsistent because t1 wouldn't be at l1_1 anymore after step 19. Let me fix this:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
3. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
5. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
6. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
7. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
8. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
9. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
10. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
11. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
12. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2
13. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
14. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
15. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
16. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
17. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
18. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
19. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (t1 is still at l1_1 after step 4)
20. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
21. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

This gives us a 21-step plan, which is more efficient.

Actually, I think I need to recheck this carefully. The state after step 4:
- p1 is at l1_1
- t1 is at l1_1
- We then load p1 onto a1

So t1 remains at l1_1 throughout steps 5-18. After step 18, p2 is at l1_1 and t1 is also at l1_1, so we can proceed with loading p2 onto t1, driving it to l1_4, and unloading it.

Yeah, I think the 21-step plan is correct and optimal.

But wait, let me double-check one more thing. After unloading p1 from t1 at l1_1 (step 4), t1 remains at l1_1. Similarly, after unloading p1 from t2 at l2_3 (step 11), t2 remains at l2_3. I just want to make sure I'm being logically consistent with the truck movements.

Actually, let me redo this entire solution step by step, tracking the location of each object to ensure correctness:

Initial state:
- Package p1 is at l1_5
- Package p2 is at l2_2
- Truck t1 is at l1_4
- Truck t2 is at l2_5
- Airplane a1 is at l1_1
- Airplane a2 is at l2_1

Goal:
- Package p1 should be at l2_3
- Package p2 should be at l1_4

Let's solve this systematically:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1
   After: t1 is at l1_5, p1 is at l1_5

2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
   After: p1 is in t1, t1 is at l1_5

3. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
   After: t1 is at l1_1, p1 is in t1

4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
   After: p1 is at l1_1, t1 is at l1_1

5. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
   After: p1 is in a1, a1 is at l1_1, t1 is at l1_1

6. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
   After: a1 is at l2_1, p1 is in a1, t1 is at l1_1

7. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
   After: p1 is at l2_1, a1 is at l2_1, t1 is at l1_1

8. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
   After: t2 is at l2_1, p1 is at l2_1, a1 is at l2_1, t1 is at l1_1

9. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
   After: p1 is in t2, t2 is at l2_1, a1 is at l2_1, t1 is at l1_1

10. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
    After: t2 is at l2_3, p1 is in t2, a1 is at l2_1, t1 is at l1_1

11. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
    After: p1 is at l2_3 (GOAL 1 ACHIEVED), t2 is at l2_3, a1 is at l2_1, t1 is at l1_1

12. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2
    After: t2 is at l2_2, p2 is at l2_2, p1 is at l2_3, a1 is at l2_1, t1 is at l1_1

13. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
    After: p2 is in t2, t2 is at l2_2, p1 is at l2_3, a1 is at l2_1, t1 is at l1_1

14. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
    After: t2 is at l2_1, p2 is in t2, p1 is at l2_3, a1 is at l2_1, t1 is at l1_1

15. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
    After: p2 is at l2_1, t2 is at l2_1, p1 is at l2_3, a1 is at l2_1, t1 is at l1_1

16. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
    After: p2 is in a2, a2 is at l2_1, t2 is at l2_1, p1 is at l2_3, a1 is at l2_1, t1 is at l1_1

17. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
    After: a2 is at l1_1, p2 is in a2, t2 is at l2_1, p1 is at l2_3, a1 is at l2_1, t1 is at l1_1

18. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
    After: p2 is at l1_1, a2 is at l1_1, t2 is at l2_1, p1 is at l2_3, a1 is at l2_1, t1 is at l1_1

19. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
    After: p2 is in t1, t1 is at l1_1, a2 is at l1_1, t2 is at l2_1, p1 is at l2_3, a1 is at l2_1

20. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
    After: t1 is at l1_4, p2 is in t1, a2 is at l1_1, t2 is at l2_1, p1 is at l2_3, a1 is at l2_1

21. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
    After: p2 is at l1_4 (GOAL 2 ACHIEVED), t1 is at l1_4, a2 is at l1_1, t2 is at l2_1, p1 is at l2_3, a1 is at l2_1

So the final state is:
- Package p1 is at l2_3 ✓
- Package p2 is at l1_4 ✓
- Truck t1 is at l1_4
- Truck t2 is at l2_1
- Airplane a1 is at l2_1
- Airplane a2 is at l1_1

This 21-step plan accomplishes the goal efficiently. There's one optimization I initially missed: we could use airplane a2 instead of a1 to transport package p2, since a2 is already at airport l2_1. I've included this optimization in the plan above.

Do we need any additional optimizations? Let's think...

Since the goal requires that p1 ends up at l2_3 and p2 ends up at l1_4, and they start in different cities, the airplanes must be used to transport them between cities. The plan we've constructed does this efficiently, using the trucks to move packages within cities and the airplanes to move them between cities.

I can't think of any other optimizations that would reduce the number of steps further. This 21-step plan seems to be the optimal solution.

Let me double check one more thing. I'm not entirely sure in step 16 if a2 is at l2_1 from the init state. Let me check the initial state again:
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

Yes, a2 is initially at l2_1. So step 16 (loading p2 onto a2 at l2_1) is valid.

I think this 21-step plan is correct and optimal:
1. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
3. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
5. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
6. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
7. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
8. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
9. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
10. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
11. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
12. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2
13. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
14. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
15. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
16. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
17. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
18. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
19. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
20. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
21. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

Yep, this is the optimal solution as far as I can tell. Let's make sure I applied the action templates correctly too:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1 ✓
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 ✓
3. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1 ✓
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 ✓
5. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 ✓
6. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 ✓
7. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 ✓
8. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 ✓
9. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 ✓
10. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2 ✓
11. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 ✓
12. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2 ✓
13. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 ✓
14. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 ✓
15. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 ✓
16. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 ✓
17. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 ✓
18. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 ✓
19. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 ✓
20. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1 ✓
21. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 ✓

Everything looks correct. There's actually a typo in the original action descriptions I was given: "loadairplane p ap l" is listed twice, with the second instance presumably meant to be "unloadairplane p ap l". This doesn't affect the solution, as I've been using the correct action names.
