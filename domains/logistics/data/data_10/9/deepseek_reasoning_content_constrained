Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. Hmm, the goal is to get p1 to l2_3 and p2 to l1_4. But there are a bunch of constraints to satisfy. Let me start by understanding the initial state and the constraints.

First, initial state: p1 is in l1_5 (city c1), p2 in l2_2 (city c2). The trucks and airplanes are in various locations. Trucks can only move within their city, and airplanes between airports. So to move packages between cities, probably need airplanes.

Constraints are complex. Let's list them:

1. At some point, p2 must be in l2_1. And if p2 is in l2_1, there must have been a prior state where p1 is in l2_1 or p2 is in l1_1. But p1 starts in c1, so getting p1 to l2_1 (airport of c2) would require flying. Alternatively, p2 could be moved to l1_1 (airport of c1) first. But how?

2. p1 must be in l1_1 at some state. Then, after that state, p2 must be in l1_1 either then or later.

3. At some point, p2 is in a1 or in l1_3.

4. p2 must be in l1_4 (the goal, but also as a constraint). When that happens, there must be an earlier state where p1 was in l2_2.

5. p2 must be in a1 at some point.

6. At some point, p2 is in l2_5 or l1_2.

7. p2 must be in l1_5 at some point.

8. At some point, p1 is in l1_2 or l2_2.

9. p1 must be in a2.

10. p2 must be in l2_5 (which is already its initial location, so that's covered).

Wait, initial state says "Package p2 is in location l2_2". Wait, the original state says "Package p2 is in location l2_2" but one of the constraints is that p2 must be in l2_5 at some state. But initially, p2 is in l2_2. So maybe need to move p2 to l2_5 at some point. But how? Because the goal is to have p2 in l1_4. So perhaps move p2 from l2_2 to l2_5 (using truck t2?), then later move it again. But maybe that's necessary to satisfy the constraint that p2 is in l2_5.

Wait the original state says "Package t1 is in location l1_4", "Package t2 is in location l2_5". Wait, those are trucks? Because the objects include "truck t1" and "truck t2". So the initial state says truck t1 is in l1_4, and truck t2 is in l2_5. Also, package p1 is in l1_5, p2 in l2_2. Airplanes a1 is in l1_1 (airport of c1), a2 in l2_1 (airport of c2).

So, to move p1 from c1 to c2, need to use airplane. But first, need to get p1 to an airport. So in c1, use truck t1 (which is in l1_4) to pick up p1 from l1_5. But t1 is in l1_4. So need to drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_5 (same city c1), load p1, then drive to l1_1 (airport), unload, then load onto airplane a1, fly to c2's airport l2_1, unload, then maybe use truck t2 (which is in l2_5) to drive to l2_1, pick up p1, drive to l2_3, and unload.

But wait, the goal is l2_3 in c2. So maybe after flying p1 to l2_1, use a truck in c2 to move it to l2_3. But t2 is in l2_5. So drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (airport), load p1, then drive to l2_3, unload.

For p2, which is in l2_2 (c2), need to get it to l1_4 (c1). So perhaps use airplane a2 in l2_1. But p2 is in l2_2. So first, use truck t2 (which is in l2_5) to drive to l2_2, load p2, drive to l2_1 (airport), unload, load onto a2, fly to l1_1 (c1's airport), unload, then use truck t1 (which is in l1_4) to drive to l1_1, load p2, drive to l1_4, unload.

But let's check the constraints. Let's go through each one:

Constraint 1: p2 must be in l2_1 at some point. Also, if it's in l2_1, then earlier state where p1 is in l2_1 or p2 is in l1_1. So moving p2 to l2_1 (airport of c2) would require that before that, either p1 was there or p2 was in l1_1.

But how can p2 be in l1_1? That's the airport in c1. So maybe when moving p2 to l1_1 (via airplane), that would satisfy the condition. Wait, but if we fly p2 to l1_1, then before that, when p2 is loaded into the airplane at l2_1, which would require that p2 is at l2_1. But then the constraint is that if p2 is in l2_1, then before that, p1 was in l2_1 or p2 was in l1_1. Wait, this could be a problem. Let's say we move p2 to l2_1 via truck. So, first, move p2 from l2_2 to l2_5 (using truck t2, which is already there?), then drive t2 to l2_2, load p2, drive to l2_1. But then when p2 is in l2_1, the constraint says that before that, there must be a state where p1 is in l2_1 or p2 is in l1_1. But if p1 hasn't been moved yet, that's not possible. So maybe the order of moving p1 and p2 matters here.

Alternatively, maybe we need to first get p1 to l2_1, then move p2 to l2_1. Let's think. For example, if p1 is flown to l2_1, then p2 is moved to l2_1. Then, when p2 is in l2_1, the prior state where p1 is in l2_1 would satisfy the constraint.

But how to get p1 to l2_1. Let's think step by step.

First, for p1:

p1 is in l1_5 (c1). Need to get it to l2_3 (c2). So steps:

1. Drive truck t1 (in l1_4) to l1_5 (same city c1).
2. Load p1 into t1 at l1_5.
3. Drive t1 to l1_1 (airport).
4. Unload p1 at l1_1.
5. Load p1 into airplane a1 (which is already at l1_1).
6. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1 (c2's airport).
7. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1.
8. Then, drive truck t2 (in l2_5) to l2_1.
9. Load p1 into t2 at l2_1.
10. Drive t2 to l2_3.
11. Unload p1 at l2_3.

That's for p1. Now for p2:

p2 is in l2_2 (c2). Need to get it to l1_4 (c1). So steps:

1. Drive truck t2 (in l2_5) to l2_2.
2. Load p2 into t2 at l2_2.
3. Drive t2 to l2_1 (airport).
4. Unload p2 at l2_1.
5. Load p2 into airplane a2 (which is in l2_1).
6. Fly a2 to l1_1.
7. Unload p2 at l1_1.
8. Drive truck t1 (assuming it's back in l1_1 after step 3) or maybe need to drive again. Wait, after step 3, t1 was driven to l1_1. Then after step 4, it's still there. Then, after step 7, p2 is in l1_1. So drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_1? No, wait, t1 is in l1_1 after step 3. Wait, step 3 is drive t1 to l1_1. Then step 4 unload p1 there. Then step 5 is load into airplane a1. So t1 is in l1_1. Then, to move p2 from l1_1 to l1_4, we can load p2 into t1 at l1_1, drive to l1_4, unload.

So for p2:

After flying to l1_1, steps:

8. Load p2 into truck t1 (which is in l1_1).
9. Drive t1 to l1_4.
10. Unload p2 at l1_4.

But wait, the goal is to have p2 in l1_4, which would be achieved here.

Now, check the constraints:

Constraint 1: p2 must be in l2_1 at some state. In the steps above, when p2 is unloaded at l2_1 (after step 4 of p2's movement), that's the state. So that's satisfied. Then, the condition is that if p2 is in l2_1, then there's an earlier state where p1 was in l2_1 or p2 was in l1_1. When p2 is in l2_1 (step 4), prior steps: before that, p1 was loaded into a1 in l1_1 and then flown to l2_1. So when does p1 arrive in l2_1? After step 7 (unload from a1). So in the timeline:

Assuming the plan interleaves p1 and p2 steps:

Let's see:

First, handle p1:

1. drive t1 to l1_5
2. load p1 into t1
3. drive t1 to l1_1
4. unload p1
5. load a1 with p1
6. fly a1 to l2_1
7. unload p1 at l2_1

Then, for p2:

8. drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2
9. load p2 into t2
10. drive t2 to l2_1
11. unload p2 at l2_1

At step 11, p2 is in l2_1. The constraint requires that before this, there's a state where p1 was in l2_1 or p2 was in l1_1. p1 was unloaded at l2_1 in step 7, which is before step 11. So that's satisfied.

Constraint 2: p1 must be in l1_1 at some state. Yes, step 4: unload p1 at l1_1. Then, after that, p2 must be in l1_1 at some point. When p2 arrives via airplane to l1_1 (step 7 of p2's movement), which would be after step 4. So that's okay.

Wait, but in the current plan steps, when does p2 get to l1_1? After flying a2 from l2_1 to l1_1. Let me check:

After step 11 (p2 unloaded at l2_1), next steps for p2 would be:

12. load a2 with p2 at l2_1
13. fly a2 to l1_1
14. unload p2 at l1_1

So in step 14, p2 is in l1_1. So after the state where p1 was in l1_1 (step 4), p2 arrives in l1_1 at step 14. So constraint 2 is satisfied.

Constraint 3: p2 must be in a1 or l1_3. In the plan above, p2 is never in a1. So need to have p2 in a1 at some point. How? Maybe during transportation. Wait, but p2 is loaded into a2, not a1. So this is a problem. So constraint 3 requires that at some point, p2 is in a1 or l1_3. But in the current plan, p2 is loaded into a2. So this constraint is not satisfied. So need to adjust.

Hmm, so maybe we need to use a1 to transport p2. But a1 is initially in l1_1. So to get a1 to c2's airport l2_1, we'd have to fly it there. But a1 is in l1_1. So maybe after moving p1 to l2_1, we can fly a1 back to l1_1, but not sure. Alternatively, maybe after unloading p1 at l2_1, we can load p2 into a1. But how would p2 get to l2_1? Wait, p2 is in l2_1 after being moved by truck t2. Then, load p2 into a1 (which is at l2_1?), but a1 was flown to l2_1 in step 6. So a1 is at l2_1. So after step 7 (unload p1 at l2_1), a1 is empty. Then, when p2 is unloaded at l2_1 (step 11), load p2 into a1 (instead of a2?), then fly a1 back to l1_1. Then unload p2 in l1_1. Then, that would satisfy the constraint that p2 is in a1 at some point.

So modifying the plan:

For p2:

After step 11 (p2 unloaded at l2_1), load into a1 (which is at l2_1):

12. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
13. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
14. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

Now, p2 is in a1 during steps 12-14. So the constraint 3 (p2 in a1) is satisfied. Also, constraint 8 requires that p2 is in a1 at some point, which is now covered.

But wait, constraint 8 says "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "Package p2 is in a1"". So step 12-13: when p2 is loaded into a1, that's true. So yes.

So with this adjustment, constraint 3 is satisfied (p2 is in a1), and constraint 8 is also satisfied.

Now, let's check other constraints:

Constraint 4: p2 must be in l1_4 (the goal). Also, when that happens, there must be an earlier state where p1 was in l2_2.

Wait, the goal is to have p2 in l1_4. So in the plan, after p2 is unloaded in l1_1 (step 14), we need to load it into truck t1 and drive to l1_4. So steps:

15. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
16. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
17. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

Now, when step 17 happens (p2 in l1_4), we need an earlier state where p1 was in l2_2. So in the current plan, when was p1 in l2_2? Probably never. So this is a problem. So we need to make sure that at some point before p2 is in l1_4, p1 was in l2_2.

So how to get p1 to l2_2?

In the current plan, p1 is unloaded at l2_1 (step 7), then loaded into t2 (step 8?), then driven to l2_3. So steps after step 7:

For p1:

7. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
8. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 (drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1)
9. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
10. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
11. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

So in this case, p1 is in l2_1 (step 7), then l2_3 (step 11). Never in l2_2. So to satisfy constraint 4 (when p2 is in l1_4, there must have been an earlier state where p1 was in l2_2), we need to route p1 through l2_2.

So perhaps when moving p1 from l2_1 to l2_3, go through l2_2. But cities have locations connected? Are the locations in order? The locations in c2 are l2_1 (airport), l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5. Assuming trucks can drive between any locations in the same city. So maybe drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2, then to l2_3. But that adds steps. Let's adjust:

After step 7 (p1 at l2_1), drive t2 (which is in l2_5) to l2_1. So step 8: drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2.

Then load p1 into t2 (step 9).

Then drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2 (step 10), then to l2_3 (step 11). Unload p1 at l2_2 (step 12), then reload? No, that would complicate. Alternatively, just drive through l2_2 to l2_3. Wait, but the truck can drive directly from l2_1 to l2_3 if possible. Or maybe the truck has to go through intermediate locations. The problem description doesn't specify that the locations are connected in any particular way, just that trucks can move between any locations in their city. So perhaps they can drive directly from l2_1 to l2_3. But the constraint requires that p1 is in l2_2 at some point. So to satisfy constraint 4, which requires that when p2 is in l1_4, there's an earlier state where p1 was in l2_2, we need to have p1 in l2_2 at some point before p2 is in l1_4.

So maybe modify the plan to take p1 through l2_2. For example:

After loading p1 into t2 at l2_1 (step 9), drive t2 to l2_2 (step 10), then to l2_3 (step 11). So steps:

9. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
10. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
11. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
12. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

In this case, when t2 is in l2_2 (step 10), p1 is in t2. But the location of p1 is l2_2 when the truck is there. Wait, no: the package is in the truck, so the package's location is wherever the truck is. So when the truck is in l2_2, the package is there. So when the truck moves to l2_2, p1 is in l2_2 (in the truck). Then when it moves to l2_3, p1 is unloaded there. So the state where p1 is in l2_2 occurs when the truck is there. So that satisfies the requirement for constraint 4: when p2 is in l1_4 (step 17), there's an earlier state (step 10) where p1 was in l2_2.

So that's covered.

Now, let's check other constraints:

Constraint 5: p2 must be in a1. That's covered by step 12 (loading into a1).

Constraint 6: p2 must be in l2_5 or l1_2. Initially, p2 is in l2_2. But one of the constraints is that p2 must be in l2_5 at some state. So we need to move p2 to l2_5. In the current plan, when does p2 go to l2_5? Initially, it's in l2_2, and we load it into t2 at l2_2 (step 9 for p2). But to get to l2_5, perhaps we need to drive t2 to l2_5. Wait, initially, t2 is in l2_5. So in the initial state, t2 is in l2_5, p2 is in l2_2. So first, drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2 (step 8 for p2), load p2 (step 9), then drive to l2_1 (step 10). But when t2 is driven to l2_2, p2 is loaded there, then driven to l2_1. So p2 is in l2_5 only if the truck is there. But initially, t2 is in l2_5. So when t2 is driven to l2_2, it leaves l2_5. So p2 is not in l2_5 unless we unload it there. But the constraint requires that p2 is in l2_5 at some state. Since initially p2 is in l2_2, perhaps we need to move it to l2_5 first. Wait, but that's not part of the goal. So to satisfy the constraint that p2 is in l2_5 at some state, we need to have p2 in l2_5. But initially, it's not. Wait, wait, the original state says "Package p2 is in location l2_2". So initially, p2 is in l2_2. But one of the constraints is that p2 must be in l2_5 at some state. So we have to move p2 to l2_5 and then move it out. So how?

In the current plan, p2 is moved from l2_2 to l2_1 via t2. To satisfy the constraint that p2 is in l2_5, maybe we need to drive t2 (initially in l2_5) to l2_5 again? No, because it's already there. Or perhaps unload p2 in l2_5 at some point. Let me think.

Wait, the constraint says that p2 must be in l2_5 or l1_2 at some point. So if we can get p2 to l2_5, that's sufficient. But how? Since p2 starts in l2_2, and t2 is in l2_5. So steps:

For p2:

1. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2 (same city c2).
2. Load p2 into t2 at l2_2.
3. Drive t2 to l2_5 (original location).
4. Unload p2 in l2_5.
5. Then, load p2 again into t2, drive to l2_1, etc.

This way, p2 is in l2_5 (step 4), satisfying the constraint. But this adds steps. However, the initial constraint also requires that p2 must be in l2_5 (the last constraint). So this is necessary. Otherwise, the initial state doesn't have p2 in l2_5. So we need to move p2 to l2_5 at some point.

So modifying the plan for p2:

Original steps (for p2):

1. drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2 (c2)
2. load p2 into t2 at l2_2
3. drive t2 to l2_5
4. unload p2 at l2_5
5. load p2 into t2 again
6. drive to l2_1
7. unload p2 at l2_1
... then proceed as before.

But this adds several steps, but maybe necessary to satisfy the constraint. However, this may make the plan longer. But since the problem requires an optimal plan (shortest possible), we need to see if there's a way to satisfy all constraints without unnecessary steps.

Wait, the last constraint says "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "Package p2 is in location l2_5"". So we must have p2 in l2_5 at some point. But initially, p2 is in l2_2. So the only way is to move it to l2_5. So steps:

For p2:

1. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2 (c2)
2. Load p2 into t2 at l2_2
3. Drive t2 to l2_5 (c2)
4. Unload p2 at l2_5 (now p2 is in l2_5)
5. Load p2 into t2 again
6. Drive t2 to l2_1 (airport)
7. Unload p2 at l2_1
8. Load into a1 (to fly to l1_1)
...

But this adds steps 3-4. But this is necessary to meet the constraint. So yes, this must be done.

But this would make the plan longer. But given that the user requires an optimal plan, perhaps there's a smarter way.

Wait, initially, t2 is in l2_5. So when we drive t2 to l2_2 (step 1), then back to l2_5 (step 3), we can unload p2 there. So steps:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
5. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
6. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
7. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

This way, p2 is in l2_5 at step 4. So that satisfies the constraint. But then steps 5 and 6 are needed to load again and drive to l2_1. This adds steps, but it's necessary.

Alternatively, after step 4, can we fly p2 from l2_5? But l2_5 is not an airport. So must use truck to move to airport. So the above steps are necessary.

So integrating this into the plan:

For p2:

Steps:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 (now p2 is in l2_5, satisfying the last constraint)
5. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
6. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
7. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

Then proceed to load into a1, fly to l1_1, etc.

Now, this satisfies the constraint that p2 is in l2_5 (step4) and also the last constraint.

Another constraint: The following expression must hold in at least one state: "At least one of the following conditions is true: "Package p2 is in location l2_5", "Package p2 is in location l1_2". So step4 satisfies this (p2 is in l2_5), so that's covered.

Another constraint: p2 must be in l1_5 at some state. So how? After flying p2 to l1_1, then we need to move it to l1_5. But the goal is to have p2 in l1_4. So maybe after arriving in l1_1, drive t1 (which is in l1_1) to l1_5, unload there, then drive to l1_4. But this would add steps. However, the constraint requires that p2 is in l1_5 at some point.

So steps after flying p2 to l1_1:

After step14 (unload p2 at l1_1), load into t1:

15. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
16. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
17. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 (now p2 is in l1_5)
18. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
19. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1
20. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

This adds steps 16-20. But this satisfies the constraint that p2 is in l1_5 (step17). But this makes the plan longer. Is there a shorter way?

Alternatively, when moving p2 from l1_1 to l1_4, take a detour through l1_5. So:

After step14:

15. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
16. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
17. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 (satisfies constraint)
18. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
19. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1
20. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

This way, p2 is in l1_5 at step17. So constraint satisfied.

But this adds steps. However, the user requires an optimal (shortest) plan. So perhaps there's a way to combine steps. For example, after step14, drive t1 to l1_5, unload p2, then load again and drive to l1_4. But this requires two more steps. Alternatively, can we have p2 in l1_5 during transit? No, because unloading is necessary.

Alternatively, maybe during the movement of t1 from l1_1 to l1_4, pass through l1_5. But the problem doesn't specify that locations are ordered, so trucks can drive directly between any two locations in the same city. So if t1 drives from l1_1 to l1_5, then to l1_4, that's two steps. But this would require unloading in l1_5, which satisfies the constraint. So steps:

15. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
16. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
17. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 (satisfy constraint)
18. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
19. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1
20. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (goal)

This adds four steps (15-20) for p2, but necessary to satisfy the constraint.

Now, check constraint 7: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "Package p2 is in location l1_5"". This is satisfied in step17.

Another constraint: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "At least one of the following conditions is true: "Package p1 is in location l1_2", "Package p1 is in location l2_2""". So during p1's movement, when is p1 in l2_2? When we drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2 (step10 for p1), then p1 is in t2 at l2_2. So that's covered.

Another constraint: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "Package p1 is in a2"". So p1 must be loaded into a2 at some point. But in the current plan, p1 is loaded into a1. So this is a problem. So need to adjust.

Ah, right! Constraint 9: "The following expression must hold in at least one state: "Package p1 is in a2"". So p1 must be in a2 (airplane) at some point. So how to achieve this.

Currently, p1 is loaded into a1 (step5), flown to l2_1. To get p1 into a2, we need to load it into a2. But a2 is in l2_1 (initial location). So perhaps after unloading p1 from a1 into l2_1 (step7), load it into a2, then fly a2 to l2_3? Wait, but the goal is to have p1 in l2_3, which is a city location. So perhaps:

After step7 (unload p1 from a1 into l2_1):

8. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
9. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l2_3 (but l2_3 is not an airport. Airplanes can only fly to airports. So l2_3 is a regular location, not an airport. The airports are l1_1 and l2_1. So airplanes can't land in l2_3. So that's not possible. Therefore, to get p1 to l2_3, we must use a truck. So p1 must be unloaded at l2_1 (airport), then loaded into a truck (t2) and driven to l2_3.

But to satisfy the constraint that p1 is in a2, we need to load p1 into a2. So steps:

After step7:

8. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
9. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (or any airport)
10. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

But then p1 is back in c1, which is not helpful. Alternatively, fly a2 to another airport, but that doesn't help. Hmm, this seems challenging. 

Wait, perhaps after step7, p1 is in l2_1. To load into a2 (which is in l2_1), then unload again in l2_1. That would make p1 in a2 during that time.

So steps:

7. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
8. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (now p1 is in a2)
9. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
10. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
...

But this adds steps, but satisfies the constraint that p1 is in a2 (step8). But this is two extra steps (8 and 9). However, it's necessary for the constraint.

So modifying p1's plan:

After step7:

8. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
9. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
10. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
11. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
12. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
13. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

Now, step8 satisfies the constraint that p1 is in a2.

But this adds steps. Alternatively, can we use a2 to transport p1? For example:

Instead of using a1 to fly p1 to l2_1, use a2. But a2 is initially in l2_1. So how?

Wait, initial airplanes:

a1 is in l1_1 (c1), a2 in l2_1 (c2).

To use a2 to transport p1, we'd have to fly a2 to l1_1, load p1, fly back. But that's more steps. Let's think:

Alternative plan for p1:

1. Drive t1 to l1_5, load p1, drive to l1_1.
2. Load p1 into a2 (but a2 is in l2_1). Can't do that. So a2 can't be in c1 unless we fly it there.

So perhaps:

1. fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
2. load p1 into a2 in l1_1.
3. fly a2 back to l2_1.
4. unload p1 into l2_1.
5. Then use truck t2 to move to l2_3.

This way, p1 is in a2 during steps2-4, satisfying the constraint. But this requires flying a2 to l1_1 and back, which adds steps. Let's see:

Steps for p1:

1. drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_5.
2. load p1 into t1.
3. drive t1 to l1_1.
4. unload p1 into l1_1.
5. fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
6. load p1 into a2.
7. fly a2 from l1_1 to l2_1.
8. unload p1 into l2_1.
9. load into t2, drive to l2_3.

This adds steps 5-8, but allows p1 to be in a2 (step6-7). But this is longer than the previous plan. However, it satisfies the constraint.

But this may not be optimal. The previous plan required adding steps 8-9 (load into a2 and unload), which is two steps, whereas this alternative adds four steps. So the previous plan is better.

So in the previous plan, after unloading p1 from a1 (step7), we load into a2 (step8), then unload (step9), then load into truck (step10). This adds two steps but satisfies the constraint.

Now, checking all constraints again:

- Constraint9 (p1 in a2): satisfied in step8.

- Constraint4 (p2 in l1_4 implies p1 was in l2_2 earlier): yes, p1 was in l2_2 in step11 (if p1 is driven through l2_2).

Wait, after modifying p1's plan to include being in a2:

After step7 (p1 unloaded from a1 into l2_1), steps:

8. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (p1 in a2)
9. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (p1 in l2_1)
10. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
11. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
12. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
13. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

So in step11, when t2 is in l2_2, p1 is in the truck, so p1 is in l2_2. So when p2 is eventually in l1_4 (step20 for p2), there's an earlier state (step11) where p1 was in l2_2. So constraint4 is satisfied.

Now, let's compile the entire plan with all these steps, ensuring all constraints are met.

Final plan outline:

For p1:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
3. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
5. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
6. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
7. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
8. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (now p1 in a2)
9. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
10. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
11. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
12. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
13. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

For p2:

14. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2 (t2 starts at l2_5)
15. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
16. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
17. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 (p2 in l2_5, satisfying constraint)
18. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
19. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
20. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
21. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (using a1, which is now in l2_1)
22. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
23. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
24. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (t1 is in l1_1 from step3)
25. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
26. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 (satisfy constraint)
27. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
28. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1
29. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (goal)

Now, check all constraints:

1. p2 in l2_1: step20. Before that, p1 was in l2_1 (step7,9,10). So when p2 is in l2_1 (step20), there's a prior state (step7 or 9) where p1 was in l2_1. So constraint1 satisfied.

2. p1 in l1_1: step4. After that, p2 is in l1_1 at step23. So constraint2 satisfied.

3. p2 in a1: step21-22. So constraint3 satisfied.

4. p2 in l1_4 (step29) requires p1 was in l2_2 earlier. p1 was in l2_2 at step11. So yes.

5. p2 in a1: step21. Constraint8 satisfied.

6. p2 in l2_5: step17. Constraint last one satisfied.

7. p2 in l1_5: step26. Satisfied.

8. p1 in l2_2: step11. Satisfies the "at least one" constraint.

9. p1 in a2: step8. Satisfied.

10. p2 in l2_5: step17. Satisfied.

Also, other constraints:

- The expression that must hold in at least one state: "At least one of: p2 in l2_5 or l1_2": step17 (l2_5).

- The expression "Package p2 is in location l1_4": step29 (goal).

- The expression "Package p1 is in a2": step8.

- The expression "At least one of p2 in a1 or l1_3": step21 (a1).

- The expression "Package p2 is in location l1_5": step26.

- The expression "Package p2 is in location l2_5": step17.

Now, check for optimality. Are there any redundant steps?

For example, after step16, p2 is driven to l2_5, unloaded (step17), then loaded again (step18) and driven to l2_1. This seems necessary to meet the constraint of p2 being in l2_5.

Similarly, loading and unloading p1 into a2 (steps8-9) adds steps but is necessary for the constraint.

I think this plan meets all constraints and is optimal in terms of steps, as any shorter plan would miss at least one constraint.
