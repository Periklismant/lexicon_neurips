Let me analyze the given planning problem:

We have a world with cities, locations, airports, trucks, airplanes, and packages. We want to transport packages p1 and p2 to specific locations.

First, I need to identify the initial state of the world:

- Cities: c1, c2
- Locations in city c1: l1_1 (airport), l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5
- Locations in city c2: l2_1 (airport), l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5
- Trucks: t1 (at location l1_2), t2 (at location l2_5)
- Airplanes: a1 (at location l1_1), a2 (at location l2_1)
- Packages: p1 (at location l1_2), p2 (at location l2_1)

The goal is to have:
- Package p1 at location l2_1 (airport of city c2)
- Package p2 at location l1_5 (in city c1)

Now, let's plan:

For package p1:
- p1 is at l1_2 in city c1
- To get to l2_1 (an airport in city c2), it needs to:
  1. Be loaded onto truck t1 (which is already at l1_2)
  2. Be transported to l1_1 (the airport of city c1)
  3. Be unloaded from t1
  4. Be loaded onto airplane a1 (which is at l1_1)
  5. Be flown to l2_1 (the airport of city c2)
  6. Be unloaded from a1

For package p2:
- p2 is at l2_1 (airport of city c2)
- To get to l1_5 in city c1, it needs to:
  1. Be loaded onto airplane a2 (which is at l2_1)
  2. Be flown to l1_1 (the airport of city c1)
  3. Be unloaded from a2
  4. Be loaded onto truck t1 (which needs to be at l1_1)
  5. Be driven to l1_5
  6. Be unloaded from t1

Wait, I notice an issue: according to the initial state, "Package t1 is in location l1_2", "Package t2 is in location l2_5", "Package a1 is in location l1_1", "Package a2 is in location l2_1". But the problem statement mentioned that t1 and t2 are trucks, and a1 and a2 are airplanes.

Let me reconsider:

- Trucks: t1 (at location l1_2), t2 (at location l2_5)
- Airplanes: a1 (at location l1_1), a2 (at location l2_1)
- Packages: p1 (at location l1_2), p2 (at location l2_1)

Now, let's plan:

For package p1:
1. Load p1 onto truck t1 at l1_2
2. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1 (the airport of city c1)
3. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1
4. Load p1 onto airplane a1 at l1_1
5. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1 (the airport of city c2)
6. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1

For package p2:
1. Load p2 onto airplane a2 at l2_1
2. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1 (the airport of city c1)
3. Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1
4. Load p2 onto truck t1 at l1_1 (t1 is already at l1_1 after step 2 of p1's plan)
5. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_5
6. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_5

Actually, I need to check the timing a bit more carefully:

1. Load p1 onto truck t1 at l1_2
2. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1
3. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1
4. Load p1 onto airplane a1 at l1_1
5. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1

Now, as for p2, a2 and p2 are both at l2_1. We can:
6. Load p2 onto airplane a2 at l2_1
7. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1
8. Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1

Now, we need to get p2 to l1_5:
9. Load p2 onto truck t1 at l1_1 (t1 is still at l1_1 after step 3)
10. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_5
11. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_5

And we also need to ensure p1 is unloaded at l2_1:
12. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1 (this can be done any time after step 5)

Actually, let's check a few steps to ensure we have a consistent and optimal plan.

First, let's look at the available actions:
- "loadtruck p t l": Load package p in truck t. Both p and t are in location l.
- "loadairplane p ap l": Load package p in airplane ap. Both p and ap are in location l.
- "unloadtruck p t l": Unload package p from truck t in location l.
- "loadairplane p ap l": Unload package p from airplane ap in location l. (There seems to be a typo here, this should be "unloadairplane".)
- "drivetruck t l_from l_to c": Drive truck t from location l_from to location l_to in city c.
- "flyairplane ap l_from l_to": Fly airplane ap from location l_from to location l_to.

Let's start planning properly:

1. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
2. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
3. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
4. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
6. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
7. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
8. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
9. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
10. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
11. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
12. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

This seems to be an optimal plan, but let me double-check:

- p1 starts at l1_2 and ends at l2_1 (the airport of city c2).
- p2 starts at l2_1 (the airport of city c2) and ends at l1_5 (in city c1).

For p1:
- Load onto t1 at l1_2 (where it starts).
- Transport with t1 to l1_1 (the airport of city c1).
- Transfer to airplane a1 at l1_1.
- Transport with a1 to l2_1.
- Unload at l2_1.

For p2:
- Load onto a2 at l2_1 (where it starts).
- Transport with a2 to l1_1 (the airport of city c1).
- Transfer to truck t1 at l1_1.
- Transport with t1 to l1_5.
- Unload at l1_5.

Hmm, actually, I'm noticing the initial state says:
"Package t1 is in location l1_2", "Package t2 is in location l2_5", "Package p1 is in location l1_2", "Package p2 is in location l2_1", "Package a1 is in location l1_1", "Package a2 is in location l2_1".

If t1, t2, a1, and a2 are all referred to as "Package", there might be a misunderstanding. Let's reinterpret the state to ensure clarity:

- Packages: p1 (at location l1_2), p2 (at location l2_1)
- Trucks: t1 (at location l1_2), t2 (at location l2_5)
- Airplanes: a1 (at location l1_1), a2 (at location l2_1)

For the sake of clarity and to ensure a correct plan, I'll proceed with this interpretation.

For package p1:
1. Load p1 onto truck t1 at l1_2 (both p1 and t1 are at l1_2).
2. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1 (the airport of city c1).
3. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1.
4. Load p1 onto airplane a1 at l1_1 (both p1 and a1 are at l1_1).
5. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1 (the airport of city c2).
6. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1.

For package p2:
7. Load p2 onto airplane a2 at l2_1 (both p2 and a2 are at l2_1).
8. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1 (the airport of city c1).
9. Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1.
10. Load p2 onto truck t1 at l1_1 (both p2 and t1 are at l1_1 after step 3).
11. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_5.
12. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_5.

This seems to be an optimal plan.

Let me go through the actions one by one to ensure correctness:

1. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
   - Pre: p1 and t1 are at l1_2.
   - Effect: p1 is in t1 and not at l1_2.

2. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
   - Pre: t1 is at l1_2 and both l1_2 and l1_1 are in city c1.
   - Effect: t1 is at l1_1 and not at l1_2.

3. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
   - Pre: t1 is at l1_1 and p1 is in t1.
   - Effect: p1 is at l1_1 and not in t1.

4. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
   - Pre: p1 and a1 are at l1_1.
   - Effect: p1 is in a1 and not at l1_1.

5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
   - Pre: a1 is at l1_1.
   - Effect: a1 is at l2_1 and not at l1_1.

6. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
   - Pre: a1 is at l2_1 and p1 is in a1.
   - Effect: p1 is at l2_1 and not in a1.

7. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
   - Pre: p2 and a2 are at l2_1.
   - Effect: p2 is in a2 and not at l2_1.

8. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
   - Pre: a2 is at l2_1.
   - Effect: a2 is at l1_1 and not at l2_1.

9. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
   - Pre: a2 is at l1_1 and p2 is in a2.
   - Effect: p2 is at l1_1 and not in a2.

10. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
    - Pre: p2 and t1 are at l1_1.
    - Effect: p2 is in t1 and not at l1_1.

11. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
    - Pre: t1 is at l1_1 and both l1_1 and l1_5 are in city c1.
    - Effect: t1 is at l1_5 and not at l1_1.

12. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
    - Pre: t1 is at l1_5 and p2 is in t1.
    - Effect: p2 is at l1_5 and not in t1.

Actually, I want to re-read the initial state to ensure that the setup is correct.

The original state of the world is:
- "Location l1_1 is in city c1"
- "Location l1_2 is in city c1"
- "Location l1_3 is in city c1"
- "Location l1_4 is in city c1"
- "Location l1_5 is in city c1"
- "Location l2_1 is in city c2"
- "Location l2_2 is in city c2"
- "Location l2_3 is in city c2"
- "Location l2_4 is in city c2"
- "Location l2_5 is in city c2"
- "Package t1 is in location l1_2"
- "Package t2 is in location l2_5"
- "Package p1 is in location l1_2"
- "Package p2 is in location l2_1"
- "Package a1 is in location l1_1"
- "Package a2 is in location l2_1"

Hmm, actually I'm a bit confused about this. It says "Package t1", "Package t2", "Package a1", "Package a2", but t1 and t2 are supposed to be trucks, and a1 and a2 are supposed to be airplanes.

Let me double-check the list of objects in the domain:
- "location l1_2", "location l1_3", "location l1_4", "location l1_5", "location l2_2", "location l2_3", "location l2_4", "location l2_5"
- "city c1", "city c2"
- "package p1", "package p2"
- "truck t1", "truck t2"
- "airplane a1", "airplane a2"
- "airport l1_1", "airport l2_1"

So, the correct types are: 
- p1 and p2 are packages
- t1 and t2 are trucks
- a1 and a2 are airplanes
- l1_1 and l2_1 are airports

I think there's a misunderstanding in the initial state description. Let me reinterpret it as:
- "Truck t1 is in location l1_2"
- "Truck t2 is in location l2_5"
- "Package p1 is in location l1_2"
- "Package p2 is in location l2_1"
- "Airplane a1 is in location l1_1"
- "Airplane a2 is in location l2_1"

With this reinterpretation, I'll recheck the logic of my plan:

For package p1:
1. Load p1 onto truck t1 at l1_2.
2. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1.
3. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1.
4. Load p1 onto airplane a1 at l1_1.
5. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
6. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1.

For package p2:
7. Load p2 onto airplane a2 at l2_1.
8. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
9. Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1.
10. Load p2 onto truck t1 at l1_1.
11. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_5.
12. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_5.

This plan seems consistent with the state of the world, and it should also be optimal in terms of the number of actions.

Let's double-check the plan actions once more:

1. `loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2`
   - Pre: p1 and t1 are at l1_2 (true from initial state).
   - Effect: p1 is in t1 and not at l1_2.

2. `drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1`
   - Pre: t1 is at l1_2 (true after step 1) and both l1_2 and l1_1 are in city c1 (true from initial state).
   - Effect: t1 is at l1_1 and not at l1_2.

3. `unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1`
   - Pre: t1 is at l1_1 (true after step 2) and p1 is in t1 (true after step 1).
   - Effect: p1 is at l1_1 and not in t1.

4. `loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1`
   - Pre: p1 and a1 are at l1_1 (true after step 3 for p1, and from initial state for a1).
   - Effect: p1 is in a1 and not at l1_1.

5. `flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1`
   - Pre: a1 is at l1_1 (true after step 4).
   - Effect: a1 is at l2_1 and not at l1_1.

6. `unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1`
   - Pre: a1 is at l2_1 (true after step 5) and p1 is in a1 (true after step 4).
   - Effect: p1 is at l2_1 and not in a1.

7. `loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1`
   - Pre: p2 and a2 are at l2_1 (true from initial state).
   - Effect: p2 is in a2 and not at l2_1.

8. `flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1`
   - Pre: a2 is at l2_1 (true after step 7).
   - Effect: a2 is at l1_1 and not at l2_1.

9. `unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1`
   - Pre: a2 is at l1_1 (true after step 8) and p2 is in a2 (true after step 7).
   - Effect: p2 is at l1_1 and not in a2.

10. `loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1`
    - Pre: p2 and t1 are at l1_1 (true after step 9 for p2, and after step 2 for t1).
    - Effect: p2 is in t1 and not at l1_1.

11. `drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1`
    - Pre: t1 is at l1_1 (true after step 10) and both l1_1 and l1_5 are in city c1 (true from initial state).
    - Effect: t1 is at l1_5 and not at l1_1.

12. `unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5`
    - Pre: t1 is at l1_5 (true after step 11) and p2 is in t1 (true after step 10).
    - Effect: p2 is at l1_5 and not in t1.

Double-checking once more, this plan seems optimal and valid. So, the optimal plan for the given problem is:

1. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
2. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
3. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
4. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
6. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
7. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
8. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
9. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
10. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
11. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
12. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
