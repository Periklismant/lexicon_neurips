Let me analyze the problem:

We have two cities `c1` and `c2`. 
- City `c1` has locations: `l1_1` (an airport), `l1_2`, `l1_3`, `l1_4`, and `l1_5`.
- City `c2` has locations: `l2_1` (an airport), `l2_2`, `l2_3`, `l2_4`, and `l2_5`.

We have packages `p1` and `p2`, trucks `t1` and `t2`, and airplanes `a1` and `a2`.

The initial state is:
- Packages: `p1` and `p2` are in location `l2_2`.
- Trucks: `t1` is in location `l1_3`, `t2` is in location `l2_5`.
- Airplanes: `a1` is in location `l1_1`, `a2` is in location `l2_1`.

The goal is to:
- Move `p1` to location `l1_4` (which is in city `c1`).
- Move `p2` to location `l2_4` (which is in city `c2`).

Actions we can take include loading and unloading packages to/from trucks and airplanes, driving trucks between locations within a city, and flying airplanes between airports.

For `p1`, we need to move it from `l2_2` (in city `c2`) to `l1_4` (in city `c1`). Since it crosses cities, we need an airplane. We can use truck `t2` to move `p1` from `l2_2` to airport `l2_1`, then use airplane `a2` to fly it to airport `l1_1` in city `c1`, and finally use truck `t1` to move it from `l1_1` to `l1_4`.

For `p2`, we need to move it from `l2_2` to `l2_4`, both in city `c2`. We can use truck `t2` to carry it directly.

Let's create a plan:

1. First, move truck `t2` from `l2_5` to `l2_2` to pick up packages.
2. Load `p1` onto `t2`.
3. Load `p2` onto `t2`.
4. Drive `t2` to airport `l2_1`.
5. Unload `p1` from `t2`.
6. Load `p1` onto airplane `a2`.
7. Fly `a2` from `l2_1` to `l1_1`.
8. Unload `p1` from `a2`.
9. Drive `t1` from `l1_3` to `l1_1` to pick up `p1`.
10. Load `p1` onto `t1`.
11. Drive `t1` from `l1_1` to `l1_4`.
12. Unload `p1` from `t1`, placing it at `l1_4` (goal achieved for `p1`).
13. Drive `t2` from `l2_1` to `l2_4`.
14. Unload `p2` from `t2`, placing it at `l2_4` (goal achieved for `p2`).

That's our plan. Let's formalize it:

```
drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
```

Wait, I noticed an issue in the initial state:

```
"Package t1 is in location l1_3"
"Package t2 is in location l2_5"
"Package p1 is in location l2_2"
"Package p2 is in location l2_2"
"Package a1 is in location l1_1"
"Package a2 is in location l2_1"
```

Trucks (`t1` and `t2`) and airplanes (`a1` and `a2`) are referred to as packages. I think this is a mistake. They should be:

```
"Truck t1 is in location l1_3"
"Truck t2 is in location l2_5"
"Package p1 is in location l2_2"
"Package p2 is in location l2_2"
"Airplane a1 is in location l1_1"
"Airplane a2 is in location l2_1"
```

Assuming the corrected initial state, my previous plan still stands. Let's proceed with it.

Wait, I just noticed another issue with my plan. The action `loadairplane` is duplicated in the given actions list. One of them should be `unloadairplane`. Also, I want to ensure I understand the format of the actions correctly. Let me verify against the problem description:

For `loadtruck p t l`, we are loading package `p` into truck `t` at location `l`.
For `loadairplane p ap l`, we are loading package `p` into airplane `ap` at location `l`.
For `unloadtruck p t l`, we are unloading package `p` from truck `t` at location `l`.
For `unloadairplane p ap l`, we are unloading package `p` from airplane `ap` at location `l`.
For `drivetruck t l_from l_to c`, we are driving truck `t` from location `l_from` to location `l_to` in city `c`.
For `flyairplane ap l_from l_to`, we are flying airplane `ap` from location `l_from` to location `l_to`.

My plan is correct, I was just concerned that the repeated action might suggest a different format for `unloadairplane` but the preconditions and effects clarify that.

Let's proceed with the original plan:

```
drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
```

With this plan, both `p1` and `p2` should reach their intended locations.

But actually, I'm not sure if the proposed plan is optimal. Let me try to think through it again to see if we can reduce the number of steps.

For `p1`:
1. `p1` starts at `l2_2` in city `c2`.
2. It needs to get to `l1_4` in city `c1`.
3. Since it crosses cities, it needs to use an airplane.
4. We need to get it to airport `l2_1` in city `c2`, then fly to airport `l1_1` in city `c1`, and then drive to `l1_4`.

For `p2`:
1. `p2` starts at `l2_2` in city `c2`.
2. It needs to get to `l2_4` in city `c2`.
3. Since it stays within the same city, a truck can handle the entire journey.

Actually, the plan above seems optimal for the given scenario. Let's stick with it.

```
drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
```

This seems like a reasonable and efficient plan to achieve our goals.

Actually, I notice in the prompt that the preconditions and effects don't state that "l_from and l_to" in flyairplane must be airports. They only talk about if the "airplane ap is situated in l_from." This makes me slightly confused about the problem description, but given the context and other information provided, I think it's implied that airplanes can only fly between airports. So, I'll proceed with my original plan, which assumes that airplanes can only move between airports.

Oh, and I remember now:

The action definition says, "flyairplane ap l_from l_to: Fly airplane ap from location l_from to location l_to." Airplanes can only move between locations, so they need to move between locations, but which locations those are is not restricted by the action definition. However, I need to look at the initial state to infer which locations are airports. In this case, l1_1 and l2_1 are specifically mentioned as airports.

Now, the additional constraints on the plan were not clearly stated in the prompt, so I'm assuming there are no additional constraints beyond the preconditions and effects of the actions.

Actually, reading the problem description again, it clarifies, "One location of each city is an airport. [...] airplanes may move between airports." So it is indeed the case that airplanes can only fly between airports.

Also, I've review the action: "flyairplane: You may only fly an airplane ap from location l_from to location l_to if ap is situated in l_from." which confirms that there's no explicit constraint on the types of locations, but combined with the domain description, we know that airplanes can only fly between airports.

My plan is sound. Let's use it.

Wait, let me check I correctly understood the relationships between cities and locations. The initial state descriptions state the relationships (some location "is in city" somewhere), so I'll use those to ensure my city parameter in drivetruck is correct. In all cases the city is `c1` for l1_* locations and `c2` for l2_* locations. So my plan is correct.

```
drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
```

This plan correctly achieves our goals. Let's triple-check just to be sure.

For `p1`:
1. `p1` starts at `l2_2` (in city `c2`).
2. `t2` is at `l2_5` and moves to `l2_2`.
3. `p1` is loaded onto `t2`.
4. `t2` (with `p1`) is driven to `l2_1` (the airport in city `c2`).
5. `p1` is unloaded from `t2` at `l2_1`.
6. `p1` is loaded onto airplane `a2` at `l2_1`.
7. `a2` (with `p1`) is flown from `l2_1` to `l1_1` (the airport in city `c1`).
8. `p1` is unloaded from `a2` at `l1_1`.
9. `t1` is driven from `l1_3` to `l1_1`.
10. `p1` is loaded onto `t1` at `l1_1`.
11. `t1` (with `p1`) is driven to `l1_4`.
12. `p1` is unloaded from `t1` at `l1_4`, which is our goal for `p1`.

For `p2`:
1. `p2` starts at `l2_2` (in city `c2`).
2. `t2` is at `l2_5` and moves to `l2_2`.
3. `p2` is loaded onto `t2`.
4. `t2` (with `p2`) is driven to `l2_1`.
5. `t2` (with `p2` still inside) is driven to `l2_4`.
6. `p2` is unloaded from `t2` at `l2_4`, which is our goal for `p2`.

Now I'm convinced that my plan works. Let's formalize it in the format requested:

```
drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
```

Wait, let me check for action correctness: 
"loadairplane p ap l": Load package p in airplane ap. Both p and ap are in location l.
"loadairplane p ap l": Unload package p from airplane ap in location l.

In the action definitions, I notice that `loadairplane` appears twice. One of them is clearly supposed to be `unloadairplane`. Let me check the preconditions and effects to be sure.

For `loadairplane`, the precondition states: "You may only load package p in a airplane ap if ap and t are in the same location l." But the t isn't defined, so I'm guessing this is a mistake and it should refer to `p` and `ap`. And the effect is as expected.

For `unloadairplane` (which I'm now sure should be 'unloadairplane' despite the typo in the action list), the precondition states: "You may only unload package p from a airplane ap in a location l if (i) ap is situated in l, and (ii) p is in ap." And the effect is again as expected.

Given the context and the clear intention, I'm going to assume that the second "loadairplane" in the action list is supposed to be "unloadairplane", which is what I've been using in my plan.

Let's correct the typo and proceed with the plan:

```
drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
```

This plan correctly achieves our goals.

Actually, thinking about it: could we optimize this further? I was wondering if we could deliver p2 first, then p1, and save a step, but I think we can't because we need to use t2 for both packages, and we can't be in two places at once with t2. I think the plan is optimal.

Actually, let's think some more...

Let's remind ourselves of the initial state again:
- Packages: `p1` and `p2` are in location `l2_2`.
- Trucks: `t1` is in location `l1_3`, `t2` is in location `l2_5`.
- Airplanes: `a1` is in location `l1_1`, `a2` is in location `l2_1`.

Hmm... if `p1` and `p2` are both at `l2_2`, we could potentially have a different truck handle each package, or have one truck move both packages. Since `t2` is in city c2, it would make sense to use it for both packages since they're both initially in c2. I don't think there's a more optimal plan than the one I've come up with.

Actually, we could optimize by 1 step. If p1 and p2 were loaded onto t2, and t2 taken all the way to l2_4, t2 could first drop off p2. Though with the current set up, it actually doesn't save a step because we need to leave p1 in the city c2 airport to fly, while p2 gets taken to l2_4. 

Let's try it. Maybe we could do this:

1. `t2` is at `l2_5`. Drive to `l2_2` to get p1 and p2.
2. load p1 and p2 onto `t2`.
3. drive `t2` to `l2_4` and drop off p2 (meeting the goal for p2).
4. drive `t2` to `l2_1` (the airport in c2).
5. unload p1 from `t2` and load it onto airplane `a2`.
6. fly `a2` (with p1) to  `l1_1` (the airport in c1).
7. unload p1 from `a2` and load it onto `t1` (which we've driven from `l1_3` to `l1_1`).
8. drive `t1` (with p1) to `l1_4`.
9. unload p1 from `t1`, meeting the goal for p1.

I think that might shorten the plan by 1 step (unless I made an error in the accounting). Let me formalize:

```
drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
```

That's 14 steps, which is the same as my previous plan. Actually, I'm not sure either plan is fully optimal, but in terms of the action count, they're the same. So I'll stick with the former plan for now.

```
drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
```

I think the reason the plans are the same in terms of steps is that there's no advantage in either order. The key would be if we could get a more optimal combination using both trucks, or if we could save a step using a different combination, but I can't see that with our current scenario.

Upon further reflection, I realize the reason the second plan didn't save a step is that we still need to drive t2 to l2_1 to drop off p1 for the airplane. If we had started with t2 at l2_1, we could have potentially saved a step. Let's double-check this reasoning.

1. `t2` is at `l2_5`. Drive to `l2_2` to get p1 and p2.
2. load p1 and p2 onto `t2`.
3. drive `t2` to `l2_1` (the airport in c2).
4. unload p1 from `t2` and load it onto airplane `a2`.
5. fly `a2` (with p1) to  `l1_1` (the airport in c1).
6. unload p1 from `a2` and load it onto `t1` (which we've driven from `l1_3` to `l1_1`).
7. drive `t1` (with p1) to `l1_4`.
8. unload p1 from `t1`, meeting the goal for p1.
9. drive `t2` from `l2_1` to `l2_4`.
10. unload p2 from `t2`, meeting the goal for p2.

That's 12 steps, compared to 14 in the initial plans. So that should be more optimal. Let me check my counting:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
3. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
4. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
5. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
6. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
7. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
8. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
9. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
10. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
11. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
12. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
13. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
14. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

That's 14.

Let's recount the second plan steps:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
3. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
4. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
5. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
6. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
7. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
8. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
9. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
10. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
11. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
12. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
13. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
14. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

That's also 14 (I think I didn't count right before). I don't think there's a meaningful difference in terms of step count between the two plans. The first one is somewhat cleaner conceptually, focusing on p1 first and then p2, so I'll go with that one.

Actually, can have the airplane t2 move in parallel with the airplane a2? That would save steps, but I think it's more accurate to consider each action one-by-one rather than simultaenously. So I'll still go with the first plan.

Actually, maybe we haven't thought about possibilities with airplane a1. Let me think about that.

Airplane a1 starts in l1_1, the airport in city c1. If we can somehow get both packages to l1_1 more efficiently, we might have a better plan. Since p1 and p2 are both in city c2 initially, we'll eventually have to use an airplane to move at least one package to city c1. Let me think about using each available vehicle in an optimal way.

Actually, let's see if we can do better than the 14 steps in the first plan.

I think actually we were missing a possibility to make it more concise.

What if we:

1. Drive `t2` from `l2_5` to `l2_2`.
2. Load `p2` onto `t2`.
3. Drive `t2` from `l2_2` to `l2_4`.
4. Unload `p2` from `t2`, meeting the goal for `p2`.
5. Drive `t2` from `l2_4` to `l2_2`.
6. Load `p1` onto `t2`.
7. Drive `t2` from `l2_2` to `l2_1`.
8. Unload `p1` from `t2`.
9. Load `p1` onto airplane `a2`.
10. Fly `a2` from `l2_1` to `l1_1`.
11. Unload `p1` from `a2`.
12. Drive `t1` from `l1_3` to `l1_1`.
13. Load `p1` onto `t1`.
14. Drive `t1` from `l1_1` to `l1_4`.
15. Unload `p1` from `t1`, meeting the goal for `p1`.

Hmm, I think that's 15 steps, even more than the 14 I had before. So I don't think that's a better approach.

Hmm, maybe we can somehow save one step by using a1 instead of a2. Let me try again...

Let's restate the initial state:

- Packages: `p1` and `p2` are in location `l2_2`.
- Trucks: `t1` is in location `l1_3`, `t2` is in location `l2_5`.
- Airplanes: `a1` is in location `l1_1`, `a2` is in location `l2_1`.

And a1 is at l1_1, the airport in city c1, while a2 is at l2_1, the airport in city c2. So, to get p1 to city c1, we'd have to:

1. Load p1 onto t2.
2. Drive t2 to l2_1.
3. Load p1 onto a2.
4. Fly a2 to l1_1.
5. ... and continue as before.

Or we could:
1. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.
2. Load p1 onto t2.
3. Drive t2 to l2_1.
4. Load p1 onto a1.
5. Fly a1 back to l1_1.
6. ... and continue.

The second approach uses one more step (flying a1), so it's not more efficient.

Wait, can we improve by doing a different ordering? For example, first fly a2 to c1 and then have p1 taken to meet it?

Actually, when I think about it more, it makes sense to send them both at the same time as in my original plan. Load p1 and p2 onto t2, drive it to near the airport, drop off p1 so it can go on the airplane, then have t2 continue to drive p2 to its destination. Meanwhile, the airplane a2 flies p1 to the airport in city c1, where t1 picks it up and takes it to its destination.

```
drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
```

That's 14 steps. Hmm, let me try one more time to see if I can shorten it. Okay, I'm going to think outside the box a bit. 

Actually, we need to deliver two objects to two different locations, but they're both still packages. We need one in location l1_4 (city c1) and the other in l2_4 (city c2). Since they're both at the same initial location l2_2 (city c2), we need to split them up. Either truck t2 or airplane a2 can deliver p2 (since it stays in city c2), but for p1, we definitely need an airplane to cross cities.

Let me analyze the problem from a different angle. We have trucks in both cities (t1 in city c1, t2 in city c2) and airplanes (a1 in city c1, a2 in city c2). Since p1 has to cross between cities, it must use an airplane. But p2 doesn't need to cross, so it can stay in city c2.

What if we try this?

1. Fly `a1` from `l1_1` to `l2_1`.
2. Drive `t2` from `l2_5` to `l2_2`.
3. Load `p1` onto `t2`.
4. Load `p2` onto `t2`.
5. Drive `t2` from `l2_2` to `l2_1`.
6. Unload `p1` from `t2`.
7. Load `p1` onto airplane `a1`.
8. Fly `a1` from `l2_1` to `l1_1`.
9. Unload `p1` from `a1`.
10. Drive `t1` from `l1_3` to `l1_1`.
11. Load `p1` onto `t1`.
12. Drive `t1` from `l1_1` to `l1_4`.
13. Unload `p1` from `t1`, meeting the goal for `p1`.
14. Drive `t2` from `l2_1` to `l2_4`.
15. Unload `p2` from `t2`, meeting the goal for `p2`.

Actually, that's 15 steps, even more than the 14 in the original plan.

But why are these all 14 steps?

```
drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
```

If I count these, it's 14 steps. But I'm wondering if there's a more efficient way.

Actually, I just realized a potential issue: There's an assumption in the preconditions that for loadtruck and unloadtruck, both the truck and the package/location must be in the same place. But there's no check that a truck or airplane only contains a single item at a time. So I assume a truck or airplane can contain multiple packages, which is why I have both p1 and p2 in t2 at the same time.

Actually, can a truck carry multiple packages at once? Certainly the "unloadtruck" operation says we unload a specific package, so multiple packages can be in a truck. And there's no constraint stated.

Anyway, let's see if there's any way to further optimize, but i'm starting to think there's not.

Actually, what if, instead of loading p1 and p2 one after the other, we do it in the opposite order? Could that change anything?

```
drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
```

No, that's still 14 steps.

What if, we switch around the order so we do the p2 stuff first?

```
drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
```

That's still 14 steps.

Actually, let's think a bit more creatively. Let's have both airplanes and both trucks in motion.

What if:

1. Fly `a1` from `l1_1` to `l2_1`.
2. Drive `t2` from `l2_5` to `l2_2`.
3. Load `p1` onto `t2`.
4. Load `p2` onto `t2`.
5. Drive `t2` from `l2_2` to `l2_1`.
6. Unload `p1` from `t2`.
7. Load `p1` onto airplane `a1`.
8. Drive `t2` from `l2_1` to `l2_4`.
9. Unload `p2` from `t2`, meeting the goal for `p2`.
10. Fly `a1` from `l2_1` to `l1_1`.
11. Unload `p1` from `a1`.
12. Drive `t1` from `l1_3` to `l1_1`.
13. Load `p1` onto `t1`.
14. Drive `t1` from `l1_1` to `l1_4`.
15. Unload `p1` from `t1`, meeting the goal for `p1`.

Actually, that's 15 steps. So flying a1 to l2_1 is still more inefficient, since we have both airplanes at our disposal, and a2 conveniently starts at the airport we need (l2_1).

Ok, let's think even more creatively.

What if we use the aircraft to deliver both packages?

1. Drive `t2` from `l2_5` to `l2_2`.
2. Load `p1` onto `t2`.
3. Load `p2` onto `t2`.
4. Drive `t2` from `l2_2` to `l2_1`.
5. Unload `p1` from `t2`.
6. Unload `p2` from `t2`.
7. Load `p1` onto airplane `a2`.
8. Load `p2` onto airplane `a2`.
9. Fly `a2` from `l2_1` to `l1_1`.
10. Unload `p2` from `a2`.
11. Unload `p1` from `a2`.
12. Load `p1` onto `t1` (after driving from `l1_3` to `l1_1`).
13. Drive `t1` from `l1_1` to `l1_4`.
14. Unload `p1` from `t1`, meeting the goal for `p1`.
15. Load `p2` onto airplane `a1` (which is already at `l1_1`).
16. Fly `a1` from `l1_1` to `l2_1`.
17. Unload `p2` from `a1`.
18. Drive `t2` from `l2_1` to `l2_4`.
19. Load `p2` onto `t2`.
20. Drive `t2` from `l2_4` to `l2_4` (no movement).
21. Unload `p2` from `t2`, meeting the goal for `p2`.

Actually, I messed up the accounting. We have p2 going through city c1 back to c2, which is inefficient.

Let's be careful. My original plan was 14 steps, and I'm not convinced there's a shorter solution. So I'll stick with:

```
drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
```

Actually, since there's a substantial number of steps, I'm going to recount to triple-check.

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
3. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
4. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
5. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
6. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
7. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
8. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
9. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
10. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
11. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
12. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
13. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
14. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

So 14 steps. I'm sticking with this plan.
