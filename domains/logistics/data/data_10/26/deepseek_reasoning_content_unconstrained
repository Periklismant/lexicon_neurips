Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. First, I need to understand the initial state and the goal. The goal is to have package p1 in location l1_4 (which is in city c1) and package p2 in location l2_4 (city c2). 

Looking at the initial state, p1 and p2 are both in l2_2, which is in city c2. So both packages start in city c2. To get p1 to l1_4 in c1, which is a different city, we'll probably need an airplane. For p2, since it's staying in c2, maybe just a truck.

But let's check the objects. There are trucks t1 and t2. t1 is in l1_3 (c1), and t2 is in l2_5 (c2). Airplanes a1 is in l1_1 (c1's airport) and a2 is in l2_1 (c2's airport). Wait, the original state says "Package a1 is in location l1_1". Wait, that's a mistake. Wait, the original state lists "Package a1" but a1 is an airplane, right? Wait, the problem statement says the world includes airplanes and trucks. So maybe that's a typo. Wait, let me recheck the original state:

Original state includes:
"Package t1 is in location l1_3"
"Package t2 is in location l2_5"
"Package p1 is in location l2_2"
"Package p2 is in location l2_2"
"Package a1 is in location l1_1"
"Package a2 is in location l2_1"

Wait, that can't be right. Because t1 and t2 are trucks, a1 and a2 are airplanes. So the initial state must have the trucks and airplanes in their locations, not as packages. This seems like a typo in the problem description. Because the problem defines the world with trucks, airplanes, and packages. So the original state probably should say:

"Truck t1 is in location l1_3"

"Truck t2 is in location l2_5"

"Airplane a1 is in location l1_1"

"Airplane a2 is in location l2_1"

But the user's original state lists them as packages. That's a problem. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in their input. Because otherwise, the initial state has a1 and a2 as packages, which contradicts the problem's object list where a1 and a2 are airplanes. So I think there's a mistake here, but I have to work with what's given. Wait, the user wrote:

Original state:
...
"Package t1 is in location l1_3"
"Package t2 is in location l2_5"
"Package p1 is in location l2_2"
"Package p2 is in location l2_2"
"Package a1 is in location l1_1"
"Package a2 is in location l2_1"

But according to the objects, t1 and t2 are trucks, a1 and a2 are airplanes. So this must be a typo. The correct initial positions should be:

Truck t1 is in l1_3.

Truck t2 is in l2_5.

Airplane a1 is in l1_1.

Airplane a2 is in l2_1.

And the packages p1 and p2 are in l2_2. So, the user probably made a mistake in labeling t1, t2, a1, a2 as packages. But given that, I need to proceed. So I'll assume that the original state has:

Truck t1 is at l1_3 (c1).

Truck t2 is at l2_5 (c2).

Airplane a1 is at l1_1 (c1's airport).

Airplane a2 is at l2_1 (c2's airport).

Packages p1 and p2 are at l2_2 (c2).

So the goal is to have p1 in l1_4 (c1) and p2 in l2_4 (c2).

So for p1, since it's in c2 and needs to go to c1, we need to use an airplane. Let's think:

First, move p1 from l2_2 (c2) to the airport in c2 (l2_1), load it onto airplane a2 (since a2 is in l2_1), fly a2 to c1's airport (l1_1), unload p1, then use a truck in c1 (t1 is in l1_3) to drive to l1_1, load p1, drive to l1_4, unload. But wait, t1 is in l1_3. So steps for p1:

1. Get p1 from l2_2 to l2_1 (c2's airport). How? Use truck t2, which is in l2_5. Drive t2 to l2_2, load p1, drive to l2_1, unload. Then load onto a2, fly to l1_1. Then in c1, use truck t1 (at l1_3) to drive to l1_1, load p1, drive to l1_4, unload.

For p2, need to move from l2_2 to l2_4. Since both are in c2, use truck t2. But t2 starts at l2_5. So drive t2 to l2_2, load p2, drive to l2_4, unload.

But since both p1 and p2 are in l2_2 initially, perhaps we can use t2 to transport both. Let's see:

First, drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2. Then load p1 and p2 into t2. Then drive t2 to l2_1 (airport). Unload p1, load it onto a2. Then drive t2 to l2_4 and unload p2. But wait, after unloading p1 at l2_1, we can drive t2 to l2_4 with p2.

Wait, but p2 is in t2 after being loaded. So steps for p2:

- loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (after driving t2 to l2_2)

Then drive t2 to l2_4 and unload p2.

But first, t2 is at l2_5. So:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2

2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2

4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

That's for p2.

For p1:

After t2 is at l2_2, load p1 into t2, drive t2 to l2_1:

5. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

6. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2

7. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

Then load p1 into airplane a2 (which is at l2_1):

8. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

Fly a2 to l1_1:

9. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

Now, in c1, a1 is at l1_1. Wait, a1 is at l1_1, but a2 arrives there. Then unload p1 from a2:

10. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

Now, need to get p1 to l1_4. Truck t1 is at l1_3. So drive t1 to l1_1:

11. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1

Load p1 into t1:

12. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

Drive t1 to l1_4:

13. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

Unload p1:

14. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

So the total steps would be 14 actions. But maybe there's a way to optimize this.

Wait, can we combine some steps? For example, after flying a2 to l1_1, perhaps use a different truck or airplane? Let's see.

Alternatively, after p1 is at l1_1, we can use a different truck. But in c1, the only truck is t1, which is at l1_3. So t1 has to drive to l1_1 to pick up p1.

But that's necessary. So steps 11-14 are required.

Now, checking the constraints. The plan must satisfy all preconditions. Let's verify each step.

For p2:

1. drivetruck t2 from l2_5 to l2_2. Valid as t2 is in l2_5 and both locations are in c2.

2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2. Both are in l2_2.

3. drive t2 to l2_4. Valid.

4. unload p2 at l2_4. Valid as t2 is there and p2 is in t2.

For p1:

5. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2. Both in l2_2.

6. drive to l2_1. Valid.

7. unload p1 at l2_1.

8. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1. Both a2 and p1 are there.

9. fly a2 to l1_1. a2 is in l2_1, so can fly.

10. unload p1 from a2 at l1_1.

Then, t1 in l1_3:

11. drive t1 to l1_1. Valid.

12. load p1 into t1 at l1_1.

13. drive to l1_4.

14. unload.

So all steps are valid. But wait, in step 5, after loading p1 into t2, when driving to l2_1, both p1 and p2 are in t2. But when we unload p1 at l2_1, p2 is still in t2. Then, when t2 drives to l2_4, p2 is there. So that's okay.

But wait, steps 1-4 for p2 and 5-14 for p1. But let's check the order. Because after step 4 (unloading p2), t2 is at l2_4. But steps 5-7 require t2 to be at l2_2 again. Wait, no. Wait, the initial steps for p2 would require t2 to go from l2_5 to l2_2 (step1), load p2 (step2), drive to l2_4 (step3), unload p2 (step4). Then, for p1, we need to have t2 go back to l2_2 to load p1. Wait, but after step4, t2 is at l2_4. So that's a problem. Because after step4, t2 is at l2_4, but p1 is still in l2_2. So we can't load p1 into t2 unless t2 is at l2_2. Therefore, this approach is flawed.

Ah, here's the mistake. Because after moving t2 to l2_2 (step1), loading p2 (step2), then driving to l2_4 (step3), and unloading p2 (step4), t2 is now at l2_4. Then, to get p1 from l2_2, which is where p1 is, we need t2 to go back to l2_2. So steps for p1 would require driving t2 from l2_4 back to l2_2, load p1, then drive to l2_1. But that adds more steps. So the initial plan isn't correct.

So the problem is that after delivering p2 to l2_4, t2 is at l2_4, but p1 is still in l2_2. So how do we get p1 from l2_2 to l2_1 (the airport in c2) to load onto the airplane?

Alternative approach: Perhaps handle p1 first. Let's see.

p1 and p2 are both in l2_2. Let's use t2 to pick up both, drive to l2_1 (airport), unload p1, load it onto a2, fly to l1_1. Then, t2 can drive to l2_4 with p2.

So steps:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2.

2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2.

3. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2.

4. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2.

5. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1.

6. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1.

7. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

8. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1.

9. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2. (t2 is at l2_1 after step4, then drive to l2_4)

10. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4.

Then for p1 in l1_1:

11. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1.

12. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1.

13. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1.

14. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4.

This way, we have 14 steps. But steps 2 and 3 are two separate load actions. Wait, can we load both packages into t2 in one step? No, each load is per package. So steps 2 and 3 are necessary.

This approach might work. Let's check:

After step1, t2 is at l2_2. Load p1 (step2), load p2 (step3). Then drive to l2_1 (step4). Unload p1 (step5). Then p2 is still in t2. Then drive t2 to l2_4 (step9) and unload p2 (step10). That works.

Then, for p1, after unloading from airplane at l1_1, use truck t1 to deliver to l1_4.

So total steps: 14. But maybe there's a way to optimize.

Wait, after step4, t2 is at l2_1 with both p1 and p2. Then step5 unloads p1, then t2 still has p2. Then drive t2 to l2_4 (step9) and unload p2 (step10). That's correct.

So this plan works. But is there a shorter plan?

Alternative idea: Use two different trucks. Wait, t2 is the only truck in c2. Because t1 is in c1. So in c2, only t2 is available. So we have to use t2 for both packages.

Another thing: When flying a2 to l1_1, after unloading p1 there, can we use a different airplane to move p1 within c1? But a1 is already at l1_1. But a1 is in c1's airport. To move within c1, we need to use a truck. So no, airplanes can only move between airports.

So the steps for p1 after arriving at l1_1 are correct.

Is there a way to combine the flying and truck movements in a way that saves steps? Let me think.

Alternatively, can we use airplane a1 (in l1_1) to carry p1? But p1 is in c2's airport after being flown there. Wait, no: when a2 flies from l2_1 to l1_1, p1 is unloaded there. Then, using truck t1 to take it to l1_4. So that's necessary.

So the plan seems correct. Now, checking the constraints and preconditions again.

Another possible optimization: After step7 (fly a2 to l1_1), can we use a different truck in c1? But t1 is in l1_3. So steps 11-14 are needed.

Alternatively, if there's a way to have the airplane a1 (in l1_1) carry p1 somewhere else, but that's not needed. Because the destination is l1_4, which is in the same city as l1_1. So a truck is needed.

So the plan is 14 steps. Let's see if there's a shorter way. For example, can we handle p2's delivery while t2 is moving to l2_1? Let's see.

Wait, after step4 (t2 arrives at l2_1 with p1 and p2), we unload p1 (step5), then drive t2 to l2_4 (step9), which is in c2. Then unload p2 (step10). That's correct. So steps 5-10 are:

5. unload p1 at l2_1.

6. load p1 onto a2.

7. fly a2 to l1_1.

8. unload p1 from a2.

Then steps for p2: after unloading p1, drive t2 to l2_4 and unload p2.

But can we do step9 (drive t2 to l2_4) before flying? Let's see. No, because after step4, t2 is at l2_1. To drive to l2_4, which is in c2, but l2_1 and l2_4 are both in c2. So t2 can drive from l2_1 to l2_4, but only if they are connected via roads. The problem says trucks can move between locations in the same city. So yes. So maybe steps can be rearranged.

Wait, after step4 (t2 is at l2_1 with p1 and p2), we can unload p1 (step5), then immediately drive t2 to l2_4 (step9) and unload p2 (step10), then load p1 onto a2 and fly.

Wait, but after unloading p1 at l2_1, p1 is there. So steps:

5. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1.

6. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2.

7. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4.

Then, p1 is at l2_1. Then load it onto a2 (step8), fly to l1_1, etc.

This way, steps 6 and7 for p2 are done earlier. Then steps for p1 would be:

8. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1.

9. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

10. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1.

11. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1.

12. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1.

13. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1.

14. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4.

This reduces the steps by 2? Because steps 9 and10 (previous steps9-10) are now steps6-7, and steps8-14 become steps8-14. So the total steps are still 14, but the order is different.

But maybe this allows some steps to be done in parallel? No, because actions are sequential. So the total number is the same. So no optimization in step count.

Another idea: Could we load both p1 and p2 into the airplane a2? But p2's destination is in c2, so no need. So that's not helpful.

Wait, another approach: What if we use airplane a2 to carry p2 to l2_4? But airplanes can only move between airports. l2_4 is not an airport (the airports are l1_1 and l2_1). So airplanes can't land there. So p2 must be moved by truck.

Thus, the initial plan is necessary.

So the optimal plan would be 14 steps. But perhaps there's a shorter way. Let's recount:

For p2:

1. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2.

2. Load p2.

3. Drive to l2_4.

4. Unload p2. (4 steps)

For p1:

5. Drive t2 to l2_2. (Wait, but after step3, t2 is at l2_4. So can't do that. So maybe this approach is wrong.)

Ah, here's the problem. If we first deliver p2 to l2_4, t2 ends up there. To get p1, we need t2 to go back to l2_2, load p1, drive to l2_1, etc. That adds steps:

Steps:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2.

2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2.

3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2.

4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4.

Now t2 is at l2_4. To get p1 from l2_2, need to:

5. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_2 c2.

6. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2.

7. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2.

8. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1.

9. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1.

10. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

11. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1.

12. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1.

13. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1.

14. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1.

15. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4.

Now this plan has 15 steps, which is longer than the previous approach. So the first approach where both packages are loaded into t2 at the same time is better, resulting in 14 steps.

Therefore, the optimal plan is 14 steps. Let's verify once more:

Steps:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2. (t2 moves to l2_2)

2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2. (p1 in t2)

3. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2. (p2 in t2)

4. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2. (t2 at l2_1)

5. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1. (p1 at l2_1)

6. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1. (p1 in a2)

7. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1. (a2 at l1_1)

8. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1. (p1 at l1_1)

9. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2. (t2 at l2_4)

10. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4. (p2 at l2_4)

11. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1. (t1 at l1_1)

12. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1. (p1 in t1)

13. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1. (t1 at l1_4)

14. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4. (p1 at goal)

This is 14 steps. But wait, step9 and10 are for p2, which is handled after p1 is flown. But the steps for p2 are done in steps 3 (loading), 9 (driving to l2_4), and 10 (unloading). So this works.

Yes, this plan satisfies both goals. Each action's preconditions are met. Let's check:

- Step1: t2 is at l2_5, moves to l2_2. Valid.

- Step2: p1 and t2 at l2_2. Load.

- Step3: p2 and t2 at l2_2. Load.

- Step4: t2 drives from l2_2 to l2_1. Both in c2.

- Step5: t2 at l2_1, unload p1 (which was loaded in step2).

- Step6: a2 and p1 at l2_1. Load.

- Step7: a2 flies to l1_1. Valid.

- Step8: a2 at l1_1, unload p1.

- Step9: t2 drives from l2_1 to l2_4. Valid.

- Step10: t2 at l2_4, unload p2.

- Step11: t1 drives from l1_3 to l1_1. Valid.

- Step12: p1 and t1 at l1_1. Load.

- Step13: drive to l1_4. Valid.

- Step14: unload p1.

Yes, this plan is valid and achieves both goals. The length is 14 steps. Is there a way to make it shorter?

Alternative Idea: When t2 is at l2_1 after step4, instead of unloading p1 there, could we load p1 into a2 and fly to l1_1, then have t2 drive to l2_4 with p2. But steps are the same.

Wait, what if after step4, t2 is at l2_1 with both p1 and p2. Then, unload p1 (step5), load into a2 (step6), fly (step7), unload (step8). Then drive t2 to l2_4 (step9) and unload p2 (step10). So steps 5-10 are same.

But perhaps there's a way to combine steps for p1 and p2. For example, after step4, unload p1 and p2 at l2_1, then load p1 into a2, and have t2 drive p2 to l2_4. But p2 would need to be unloaded from t2. But p2 is in t2 after step3. So after step4, t2 is at l2_1 with p1 and p2. Then unload p1 (step5), then drive t2 to l2_4 (step9), unload p2 (step10). So that's necessary.

Another possible optimization: Could we fly a2 to l1_1 before driving t2 to l2_1? No, because p1 needs to be loaded onto a2 at l2_1.

Alternatively, after step6 (load p1 into a2), can we immediately fly a2 to l1_1 while t2 is driving to l2_4. But since actions are sequential, we can't do them in parallel. So the order must be: fly a2 after loading p1.

Thus, the plan is optimal at 14 steps.
