Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. It's a bit complex with all the constraints, but I'll break it down step by step.

First, the goal is to get p1 to l1_4 and p2 to l2_4. The initial state has p1 and p2 both in l2_2. So both packages start in city c2. But p1 needs to end up in c1's l1_4, which is a different city. That probably means we'll need to use an airplane to move between cities.

Looking at the constraints, there are a bunch of conditions that must be met. Let's list them out:

1. At some point, p1 must be in l2_1 (airport in c2). And if that happens, there must be an earlier state where either p2 is in l1_3 or p1 is in l2_4. But since our goal requires p2 to be in l2_4, maybe that part can be satisfied.

2. p1 must be in l1_1 (airport in c1) at some point. If that's true, then either p1 is in l1_5 or p2 is in l2_1 must hold in that state or later.

3. p1 must be in l2_2 (its initial location) at some state. But since the initial state already has that, maybe that's automatically satisfied. However, the problem says "must hold in at least one state", so maybe we need to ensure it's still there at some point after the plan starts. Wait, the initial state counts, right? So maybe we don't need to do anything for that.

4. If p1 is in l2_2 (which it starts in), then either p1 must go to l1_5 or l2_3 at or after that state. Since we need to move p1 out of l2_2, maybe moving it to l2_3 via truck would satisfy this.

5. The constraint that when p2 is in l2_4 (the goal), there must be an earlier state where p1 is in l1_5. So we need to get p1 to l1_5 before p2 reaches l2_4.

6. p1 must be in l2_4 at some state. But our goal is to have p1 in l1_4, so this seems conflicting. Wait, the goal is p1 in l1_4 and p2 in l2_4. But the constraint says p1 must be in l2_4 at some point. So even though the goal is l1_4, we need to have p1 in l2_4 temporarily. That complicates things. So maybe p1 has to go from l2_2 to l2_4, then somehow to l1_4.

7. p2 must be in a1 (an airplane) at some point. Also, there's a constraint that p2 must be in either a1 or t1. And p2 must be in l1_3 and l1_4 at some points. But the goal is p2 in l2_4, so how does that happen? Wait, the goal says p2 must be in l2_4. But there's a constraint that p2 must be in l1_4 at some state. That's conflicting. Wait, no, the goal is p1 in l1_4 and p2 in l2_4. But the constraints require that p2 is in l1_4 at some point. So p2 has to be moved to l1_4 and then back to l2_4? That's tricky.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let's outline the steps needed for the main goal first, then see how to fit the constraints.

For p1 to get from l2_2 (c2) to l1_4 (c1):

- Use a truck in c2 to move p1 to the airport l2_1.
- Load it onto an airplane (a2 is at l2_1 initially? Wait, initial state says "Package a1 is in location l1_1" and "Package a2 is in location l2_1". Wait, wait, the original state says "Package a1 is in location l1_1" — but a1 is an airplane, right? So the airplane a1 is at l1_1 (airport in c1), and a2 is at l2_1 (airport in c2).

So to move p1 from c2 to c1, we need to:

1. Move p1 from l2_2 to l2_1 via truck. Use truck t2 (since t2 is in l2_5 initially? Wait, original state says "Package t1 is in location l1_3", "Package t2 is in location l2_5". So t1 is in c1, t2 is in c2. So in c2, we have t2 in l2_5. But p1 and p2 are in l2_2. So need to drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2 to pick up p1.

Wait, the initial state has "Package t1 is in location l1_3" — that's probably a typo. Wait, the original state says:

"Package t1 is in location l1_3"

But t1 is a truck. So the truck t1 is in l1_3 (c1), and truck t2 is in l2_5 (c2). So in c2, t2 is in l2_5, but p1 and p2 are in l2_2. So to load them into a truck, we need the truck to be in l2_2. So first, drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2.

Then, load p1 into t2, drive t2 to l2_1 (airport), unload p1, load into airplane a2, fly a2 to l1_1 (c1's airport), unload p1 into a1 (assuming a1 is there?), but wait, a1 is at l1_1. Then load p1 into a1? Wait, no. Or maybe fly a2 to l1_1, unload p1 there, then use truck t1 (in c1) to move p1 from l1_1 to l1_4.

But let's think step by step.

For p1's journey:

1. In c2, drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2. Then load p1 into t2. Then drive t2 to l2_1. Then unload p1 at l2_1. Then load p1 into a2 (since a2 is at l2_1). Then fly a2 to l1_1. Unload p1 from a2 into l1_1. Then in c1, use truck t1 (which is in l1_3) to drive to l1_1, load p1, drive to l1_4, unload.

But wait, t1 is in l1_3. So need to drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1, load p1, then drive to l1_4.

But what about the constraints? Let's check the constraints as we go.

Constraints that must be satisfied:

- p1 must be in l2_1 at some point. That's covered when we unload p1 at l2_1 before loading into the airplane.

- When p1 is in l2_1, there must be an earlier state where either p2 is in l1_3 or p1 is in l2_4. But p2 starts in l2_2. To get p2 to l1_3 (c1), which is a different city, that's a big detour. Alternatively, p1 being in l2_4 would require moving p1 there. But the goal is to get p1 to l1_4. So maybe we need to have p1 first go to l2_4, then to l2_1, then to c1. But that complicates the plan. Let's see.

Wait, the constraint says that if p1 is in l2_1 at some state, then there must be an earlier state where p2 is in l1_3 or p1 is in l2_4. Since in our current plan, p1 is unloaded at l2_1 after being moved from l2_2 via truck. So before that, p1 was in l2_2, then loaded into t2, then driven to l2_1. So when we unload p1 at l2_1, the earlier state would be when p1 was in l2_2. But that doesn't satisfy the condition. So we need to have either p2 in l1_3 or p1 in l2_4 before p1 is in l2_1.

Hmm, so maybe we need to first move p1 to l2_4, then back to l2_1. But that's a detour. Alternatively, get p2 to l1_3. How?

To get p2 to l1_3 (which is in c1), we need to transport it from c2 to c1. So maybe load p2 into a2, fly to l1_1, unload, then use truck t1 to move to l1_3. But that's a lot of steps, and p2's goal is l2_4. So that would require moving p2 to c1 and then back to c2, which seems inefficient. But maybe necessary to satisfy the constraint.

Alternatively, maybe we can have p1 go to l2_4 first. Let's see.

If p1 is moved to l2_4 before going to l2_1, then that satisfies the condition. So how?

From l2_2, use truck t2 to drive p1 to l2_4. Then from l2_4, drive t2 back to l2_1. Then load into a2 and fly to c1.

But moving p1 to l2_4 would require:

Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2 (since t2 starts in l2_5). Then load p1 into t2. Then drive t2 to l2_4. Unload p1 there. Then later, load p1 again into t2, drive to l2_1, unload, load into a2, fly to l1_1, etc. But this adds steps, but maybe necessary for the constraints.

But the problem requires an optimal plan, so we need the shortest possible. However, the constraints might force some steps.

So let's outline the steps considering the constraints.

For p1:

1. Move from l2_2 to l2_4 (to satisfy the constraint that when p1 is in l2_1, there's an earlier state where p1 was in l2_4). But how?

Wait, the constraint says that if p1 is in l2_1 in some state, then there must be an earlier state where p2 is in l1_3 or p1 is in l2_4. So if we first take p1 to l2_4, then later to l2_1, that would satisfy the constraint.

So steps for p1:

- Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2.

- Load p1 into t2.

- Drive t2 to l2_4. (This is allowed because l2_4 is in c2, same city.)

- Unload p1 in l2_4. Now, p1 is in l2_4, which satisfies the constraint that p1 must be in l2_4 at some point. Also, when we later move p1 to l2_1, the earlier state of p1 in l2_4 meets the requirement.

Then, drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.

- Unload p1 at l2_1. Now, the constraint for p1 in l2_1 is satisfied, and the earlier state (p1 in l2_4) meets the requirement.

Then load p1 into a2.

- Fly a2 to l1_1.

- Unload p1 at l1_1. Now, the constraint that p1 must be in l1_1 is satisfied. But then, according to another constraint, when p1 is in l1_1, either p1 must go to l1_5 or p2 must be in l2_1 in that state or later.

So after unloading p1 at l1_1, we need to ensure that either p1 goes to l1_5 or p2 is moved to l2_1.

But p2's goal is l2_4. So moving p2 to l2_1 would require moving it from l2_2 to l2_1, then maybe back. But that's more steps. Alternatively, move p1 from l1_1 to l1_5. Let's see.

So after unloading p1 at l1_1, load it into truck t1 (which is in l1_3). So first, drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1. Then load p1, drive to l1_5, unload. Then drive back to l1_4. But that adds steps. Alternatively, from l1_1, drive t1 to l1_4 directly. But then the constraint requires that after p1 is in l1_1, either p1 is in l1_5 or p2 is in l2_1. So if we move p1 from l1_1 to l1_4 directly, then we need to ensure that p2 is moved to l2_1 at some point after.

But p2's path is also needed. Let's think about p2.

p2 starts in l2_2, needs to go to l2_4. So for p2:

- Use truck t2 to move from l2_2 to l2_4. But t2 is initially in l2_5.

Wait, t2 starts in l2_5. To move p2 from l2_2 to l2_4, first drive t2 to l2_2, load p2, drive to l2_4, unload. That's straightforward. But during this process, we have to satisfy the constraints related to p2.

Constraints for p2:

- Must be in l2_4 (goal), and also in l2_4 at some state (which is the goal, so that's covered).

- Must be in a1 (airplane) at some point. So need to load p2 into a1 at some point.

But a1 is in l1_1 (c1's airport). So how to get p2 into a1? That requires moving p2 to c1, load into a1, then maybe unload again. But p2's goal is in c2. So perhaps:

- Move p2 to c1's airport l1_1 via airplane a2 (from c2's l2_1), then load into a1, then fly back? But that's a lot.

Alternatively, maybe we can load p2 into a2 in c2's l2_1, fly to l1_1, unload, load into a1, then fly back. But that's complicated.

Wait, the constraint says p2 must be in a1 at some point. So p2 has to be loaded into a1, which is in l1_1. So to get p2 into a1, we need to get p2 to l1_1, then load into a1.

So steps for p2:

1. Move p2 from l2_2 to l2_1 via truck t2. Then load into airplane a2, fly to l1_1. Unload p2 into l1_1. Then load into a1 (since a1 is there). Then maybe fly a1 somewhere else? But p2's goal is l2_4. So after loading into a1, perhaps unload again, but that seems unnecessary unless required.

But this seems like a detour, but necessary to meet the constraint that p2 is in a1.

Additionally, another constraint is that p2 must be in l1_3 and l1_4 at some point. Wait, no, the constraints listed include:

"The following expression must hold in at least one state: "Package p2 is in location l1_3""

And "Package p2 is in location l1_4".

So p2 has to be in l1_3 and l1_4 at some points. But the goal is to have p2 in l2_4. So p2 must be moved to c1, then to l1_3 and l1_4, then back to c2's l2_4. That's a lot.

This complicates the plan significantly. Let's try to outline the steps for both packages while meeting all constraints.

Let's start with p1:

1. Move p1 from l2_2 to l2_4 via truck t2. This satisfies the constraint that p1 is in l2_4 at some state.

   - Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2 (c2).
   - Load p1 into t2.
   - Drive t2 to l2_4.
   - Unload p1 in l2_4.

2. Then move p1 to l2_1 to load into airplane a2.

   - Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
   - Unload p1 at l2_1.
   - Load p1 into a2.
   - Fly a2 to l1_1 (c1's airport).
   - Unload p1 at l1_1. Now p1 is in l1_1, satisfying that constraint.

   Now, when p1 is in l1_1, the constraint requires that either p1 goes to l1_5 or p2 is in l2_1. Let's choose to move p1 to l1_5 to satisfy this.

3. Move p1 from l1_1 to l1_5.

   - Drive truck t1 (in l1_3) to l1_1.
   - Load p1 into t1.
   - Drive t1 to l1_5.
   - Unload p1 there. Now, the constraint is satisfied because after p1 was in l1_1, it went to l1_5.

4. Then move p1 to the goal l1_4.

   - Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_4.
   - Unload p1. Now p1 is in l1_4, meeting the goal.

Now for p2:

The goal is l2_4. But constraints require p2 to be in a1, in l1_3, l1_4, and l2_4 (the goal). Also, when p2 is in l2_4, there must be an earlier state where p1 is in l1_5. Which we already have, since p1 is moved to l1_5 before p2 reaches l2_4.

But how to get p2 to all these places:

1. Move p2 from l2_2 to l2_1 via truck t2 (which is in l2_1 after moving p1? Wait, after moving p1 to l2_4 and then to l2_1, t2 is in l2_1. Then after unloading p1, we can use t2 again.

Wait, after step 2 for p1, t2 is in l2_1. So after unloading p1, we can load p2 into t2.

Wait, p2 is in l2_2. So steps:

Wait, initial state: p2 is in l2_2. So after moving p1 to l2_4 and then to l2_1, t2 is in l2_1. To move p2, we need to get t2 back to l2_2.

But after step 2 for p1:

- t2 is in l2_1. So to move p2 from l2_2 to l2_1, we need to drive t2 back to l2_2. But that's possible.

So after step 2 for p1:

5. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2 (c2).

   - Load p2 into t2.

   - Drive t2 to l2_1.

   - Unload p2 at l2_1.

   Now p2 is in l2_1. Then load into airplane a2 and fly to l1_1.

6. Load p2 into a2, fly to l1_1.

   - Load p2 into a2 at l2_1.

   - Fly a2 to l1_1.

   - Unload p2 at l1_1. Now p2 is in l1_1 (c1).

   Now, to get p2 into a1 (which is in l1_1):

7. Load p2 into a1 at l1_1.

   Now, the constraint that p2 is in a1 is satisfied.

   Then, to get p2 to l1_3:

   - Use truck t1 (which is in l1_5 after moving p1? Wait, after step 4, t1 is in l1_4. Let me check:

   After step 4: t1 was driven to l1_4 and unloaded. So t1 is in l1_4. To move p2 from l1_1 to l1_3:

   - Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1 (but t1 is in l1_4 after step 4). So drive t1 back to l1_1, load p2, drive to l1_3, unload.

8. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1.

   - Load p2 into t1.

   - Drive t1 to l1_3.

   - Unload p2. Now p2 is in l1_3, satisfying that constraint.

   Then, move p2 to l1_4:

9. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_4.

   - Load p2 into t1.

   - Drive to l1_4 is already there, but need to unload.

   Wait, t1 is at l1_3. Drive to l1_4 (same city c1), unload p2. Now p2 is in l1_4, satisfying that constraint.

   Then, need to get p2 back to c2's l2_4. To do that:

10. Load p2 into a1 at l1_1 (wait, after step 7, p2 is in a1. Wait, no. Let's retrace:

Wait, after step 7: p2 is loaded into a1 at l1_1. Then step 8 would require unloading p2 from a1. Wait, maybe I messed up.

Wait, step 6: p2 is unloaded at l1_1. Then step 7: load p2 into a1. So p2 is in a1. Then to move p2 to l1_3, we need to unload from a1? But a1 is an airplane. Wait, no. If p2 is in a1, to move it to l1_3, we need to unload a1 in l1_1, then use truck t1 to move. But that's not possible unless we fly a1 somewhere else.

This is getting too convoluted. Let's try to re-plan.

Alternative approach:

After moving p1 to l1_5, focus on p2's constraints.

Constraints for p2:

- Must be in a1 at some point.

- Must be in l1_3 and l1_4.

- Must be in l2_4 (goal).

So steps for p2:

1. Move from l2_2 to l2_1 via truck t2.

   - Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2 (already done for p1, but after moving p1, t2 is in l2_1. So need to drive back to l2_2.)

   Wait, after moving p1 to l2_4, then to l2_1, t2 is in l2_1. So to get p2 from l2_2 to l2_1, we need to drive t2 from l2_1 back to l2_2, load p2, then drive to l2_1.

   So steps:

   a. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2.

   b. Load p2 into t2.

   c. Drive t2 to l2_1.

   d. Unload p2 at l2_1.

2. Load p2 into airplane a2.

3. Fly a2 to l1_1.

4. Unload p2 at l1_1.

5. Load p2 into a1 (which is at l1_1). Now p2 is in a1, satisfying that constraint.

6. Fly a1 to l2_1 (c2's airport). But can airplanes fly between any airports? Yes. So fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1.

7. Unload p2 at l2_1.

8. Now, to get p2 to l2_4, use truck t2 again:

   a. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4.

   b. Load p2 into t2.

   c. Drive to l2_4 and unload. But wait, p2 is already in l2_1. So drive t2 to l2_1 is not needed. Wait, after step 7, p2 is in l2_1. So:

   a. Load p2 into t2 at l2_1.

   b. Drive t2 to l2_4.

   c. Unload p2. Now p2 is in l2_4 (goal).

But during this process, when was p2 in l1_3 and l1_4?

Hmm, missing those steps. So after step 5, p2 is in a1. Then fly a1 to l1_3? Wait, l1_3 is not an airport. Airplanes can only land at airports. So airports are l1_1 and l2_1. So to get p2 to l1_3, which is a regular location in c1, we need to use a truck.

So after step 4 (p2 is in l1_1):

5. Load p2 into truck t1 (drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1, then load).

   a. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1.

   b. Load p2 into t1.

   c. Drive t1 to l1_3.

   d. Unload p2. Now p2 is in l1_3.

6. Then drive t1 to l1_4.

   a. Load p2 into t1.

   b. Drive to l1_4.

   c. Unload. Now p2 is in l1_4.

7. Now, to get p2 back to c2. Need to move p2 to l1_1 (airport), load into a1, fly to l2_1.

   a. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1.

   b. Load p2 into t1.

   c. Unload p2 at l1_1.

   d. Load p2 into a1.

   e. Fly a1 to l2_1.

   f. Unload p2 at l2_1.

8. Then use truck t2 to move p2 to l2_4.

   a. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4.

   b. Load p2 into t2.

   c. Unload at l2_4.

But this seems very long. Also, need to check all constraints.

Let's check all the constraints:

- p1 must be in l2_1. Covered when moving p1 to a2.

- When p1 is in l2_1, earlier state has p1 in l2_4. Yes, because p1 was moved to l2_4 before.

- p1 must be in l1_1. Covered.

- After p1 is in l1_1, either p1 goes to l1_5 (which it does) or p2 is in l2_1. Yes, p1 goes to l1_5.

- p1 must be in l2_2. The initial state counts, so covered.

- When p1 is in l2_2, either it goes to l1_5 or l2_3. But in our plan, p1 moves from l2_2 to l2_4. Wait, but the constraint says that if p1 is in l2_2, then in that state or later, it must be in l1_5 or l2_3. Since p1 starts in l2_2, the initial state is s0. So in s0, p1 is in l2_2. Therefore, the constraint requires that in s0 or later, p1 is in l1_5 or l2_3. In our plan, p1 moves to l2_4, then l2_1, then l1_1, then l1_5. So eventually, p1 is in l1_5, which satisfies the constraint.

- The constraint that when p2 is in l2_4, there's an earlier state with p1 in l1_5. Yes, p1 is in l1_5 before p2 is moved to l2_4.

- p1 must be in l2_4. Covered.

- p2 must be in a1. Covered when loaded into a1.

- p2 must be in a1 or t1. Since p2 is in a1, this is covered.

- p2 must be in l1_3 and l1_4. Covered by steps 5 and 6.

- p2 must be in l1_4. Covered.

Now, putting all these steps together, the plan would be very long. But we need to make sure it's optimal (shortest possible). However, given the constraints, some steps are unavoidable.

But maybe there's a shorter path. Let's try to find a more optimal plan.

Alternative idea: Combine steps where possible.

For example, when moving p1 to l2_4, then to l2_1, use the same truck t2. Then for p2, use t2 to move to l2_1, but after moving p1.

Let me try to outline the steps concisely:

1. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2.

2. Load p1 into t2.

3. Drive t2 to l2_4. (Now p1 is in l2_4.)

4. Unload p1 in l2_4.

5. Drive t2 to l2_2. (To pick up p2.)

6. Load p2 into t2.

7. Drive t2 to l2_1.

8. Unload p2 in l2_1.

9. Load p1 into t2 (Wait, no, p1 is in l2_4. Need to get p1 to l2_1.)

Wait, this approach is getting mixed up. Let's re-clarify.

Steps for p1:

1. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2.

2. Load p1 into t2.

3. Drive t2 to l2_4. Unload p1. (Now p1 is in l2_4.)

4. Drive t2 to l2_1. (To prepare for flying.)

5. Load p1 into t2 again. Wait, no, p1 is in l2_4. So need to drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4.

Wait, this is confusing. Maybe better to have separate steps:

After step 3 (p1 in l2_4), t2 is in l2_4.

Then drive t2 to l2_1. Load p1 into t2? No, p1 is in l2_4. Wait, p1 is unloaded in l2_4. So t2 is empty. So drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.

Then, load p1 into t2 again. Wait, p1 is in l2_4. To load p1 into t2, t2 must be in l2_4. So perhaps:

After step 3 (unload p1 in l2_4), t2 is in l2_4.

Then, load p1 back into t2.

Drive t2 to l2_1. Unload p1.

Then load into a2.

But this adds steps. However, this way, p1 is in l2_4 (step 3) and then moved to l2_1 (step 7), satisfying the constraint that when p1 is in l2_1, there's an earlier state where p1 was in l2_4.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to load p1 into a2 directly from l2_4. But a2 is in l2_1. So p1 has to be moved to l2_1 first.

So steps for p1:

1. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2.

2. Load p1.

3. Drive to l2_4. Unload.

4. Drive t2 to l2_1.

5. Load p1 into t2 again? No, p1 is in l2_4, t2 is in l2_1. So that's not possible. Therefore, after step 3, p1 is in l2_4, and t2 is in l2_4. Then drive t2 to l2_1, unload p1? Wait, p1 is not in t2. So need to load p1 into t2 at l2_4.

So:

3. Drive t2 to l2_4, unload p1.

4. Load p1 into t2 again. Now p1 is in t2 at l2_4.

5. Drive t2 to l2_1.

6. Unload p1 at l2_1.

7. Load into a2.

8. Fly to l1_1.

9. Unload p1.

Then proceed as before.

This way, p1 is in l2_4 (step 3), then loaded back into t2, driven to l2_1 (step 5-6), satisfying the constraint.

But this adds more steps. But necessary for the constraint.

This seems very time-consuming. Given the constraints, perhaps this is the minimal path.

But perhaps there's a smarter way. Let's think again.

The key constraints to satisfy are:

- p1 must be in l2_1, and when that happens, there must be an earlier state where p1 is in l2_4 or p2 is in l1_3.

If we can arrange for p1 to be in l2_1 after being in l2_4, that's easier.

So the plan for p1:

- Move from l2_2 -> l2_4 (via truck t2).

- Then from l2_4 -> l2_1 (via truck t2).

- Then load into airplane a2 and fly to l1_1.

- Then move to l1_4 via truck t1.

For p2:

- Need to get to l2_4, but also must be in a1, l1_3, l1_4.

So steps:

- Move p2 from l2_2 -> l2_1 via truck t2.

- Load into a2, fly to l1_1.

- Unload and load into a1.

- Fly a1 to l2_1 (but why? To get back to c2.)

Alternatively, after loading into a1, unload in l1_1, then use truck t1 to move to l1_3 and l1_4.

Then, fly back to c2's l2_1 via a different airplane? But a1 is in l1_1, so to fly to l2_1, that's possible.

This is getting too complex. Given the time constraints, perhaps the optimal plan is as follows, trying to minimize steps:

1. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2.
2. Load p1 into t2.
3. Drive t2 to l2_4. Unload p1. (p1 in l2_4, satisfying the constraint)
4. Drive t2 to l2_1.
5. Load p1 into t2 again. (But p1 is in l2_4, t2 is in l2_1. Can't load. So this approach is wrong.)

Ah, mistake here. After step 3, t2 is in l2_4, and p1 is unloaded there. To move p1 to l2_1, we need to load it back into t2 at l2_4, then drive to l2_1.

So:

3. Drive t2 to l2_4, unload p1.
4. Load p1 into t2 at l2_4.
5. Drive t2 to l2_1.
6. Unload p1 at l2_1.

Now, when p1 is in l2_1 (step 6), the earlier state where p1 was in l2_4 (step 3) satisfies the constraint.

Then proceed to fly p1 to l1_1.

7. Load p1 into a2.
8. Fly a2 to l1_1.
9. Unload p1.

Now, p1 is in l1_1. To satisfy the next constraint, after p1 is in l1_1, either p1 must go to l1_5 or p2 must be in l2_1. Let's choose to move p1 to l1_5.

10. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1.
11. Load p1 into t1.
12. Drive t1 to l1_5. Unload.

Then, move p1 to l1_4.

13. Drive t1 to l1_4. Unload. Now p1 is at goal.

For p2:

1. Drive t2 from l2_1 (after step 6) back to l2_2.

   (After step 6, t2 is in l2_1. Need to drive to l2_2 to load p2.)

14. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2.
15. Load p2 into t2.
16. Drive t2 to l2_1. Unload p2.

Now p2 is in l2_1.

17. Load p2 into a2.
18. Fly a2 to l1_1.
19. Unload p2 into l1_1.
20. Load p2 into a1. (Now p2 is in a1, satisfying that constraint.)
21. Fly a1 to l2_1. (To get p2 back to c2.)
22. Unload p2 into l2_1.
23. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4.
24. Load p2 into t2.
25. Drive to l2_4. Unload. (Goal for p2.)

But also, p2 must be in l1_3 and l1_4. So steps needed:

After step 19, p2 is in l1_1.

26. Drive t1 from l1_5 (where it was after step 12) to l1_1.

27. Load p2 into t1.
28. Drive t1 to l1_3. Unload. (p2 in l1_3)
29. Drive t1 to l1_4. Load p2, then unload. (p2 in l1_4)

Then, to get p2 back to c2:

30. Drive t1 to l1_1. Unload p2.
31. Load p2 into a1.
32. Fly a1 to l2_1.
33. Unload p2.
34. Drive t2 to l2_4. Load p2. Unload.

This is extremely lengthy. Given that the problem requires an optimal plan, this approach is probably not optimal.

Alternative idea: Find a way to have p2 visit l1_3 and l1_4 while in transit to c2.

But this seems challenging. Alternatively, maybe some constraints can be satisfied in overlapping steps.

For example, when p2 is loaded into a1 (step 20), that's one constraint. Then, when flying a1 to l2_1, unload p2 there. Then drive to l2_4.

But during this, p2 is in l2_1, which is part of the process.

The main issue is satisfying all the state constraints. Given the complexity, perhaps the optimal plan requires around 20 steps. But I need to write it out properly.

However, due to time constraints, I'll proceed to draft the step-by-step plan based on the earlier outline, ensuring all constraints are met.
