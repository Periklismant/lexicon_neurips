```
drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
```
```
The plan moves truck t2 from its initial location l2_3 to l2_1 (where p2 is located), loads p2, drives it to l2_2, and unloads. This satisfies the goal of having p2 in l2_2 while p1 remains untouched in l2_1. The plan is optimal with 4 actions.
