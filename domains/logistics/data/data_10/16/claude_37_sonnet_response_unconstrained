Let me analyze this problem:

First, let's understand the initial state (with corrections, as there appear to be some inconsistencies):

1. Locations:
   - In city c1: l1_1 (airport), l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5
   - In city c2: l2_1 (airport), l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5

2. Packages, trucks, and airplanes (correcting what seem to be typos):
   - Truck t1 is in location l1_3 (not "Package t1")
   - Truck t2 is in location l2_3 (not "Package t2")
   - Package p1 is in location l2_1
   - Package p2 is in location l2_1
   - Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (not "Package a1")
   - Airplane a2 is in location l2_1 (not "Package a2")

3. Goal:
   - Package p1 should be in location l2_1 (which it already is)
   - Package p2 should be in location l2_2 (it's currently in l2_1)

So, our problem is to move package p2 from l2_1 to l2_2, while package p1 should remain at l2_1.

Since p2 is in l2_1 and needs to go to l2_2 (both in city c2), we can use truck t2 (which is in l2_3) to transport it.

Here's a high-level plan:
1. Move truck t2 from l2_3 to l2_1
2. Load package p2 onto truck t2 at l2_1
3. Drive truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_2
4. Unload package p2 from truck t2 at l2_2

Let's write this more formally using the provided action syntax:

```
drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
```

Let's double-check if this plan satisfies all the preconditions and achieves the goal:

1. "drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2"
   - Precondition: Truck t2 is in l2_3 (true from initial state)
   - Precondition: l2_3 and l2_1 are both in city c2 (true from initial state)
   - Effect: Truck t2 moves from l2_3 to l2_1

2. "loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1"
   - Precondition: Package p2 and truck t2 are both in l2_1 (true after step 1)
   - Effect: Package p2 is loaded onto truck t2

3. "drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2"
   - Precondition: Truck t2 is in l2_1 (true after step 1)
   - Precondition: l2_1 and l2_2 are both in city c2 (true from initial state)
   - Effect: Truck t2 moves from l2_1 to l2_2

4. "unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2"
   - Precondition: Truck t2 is in l2_2 (true after step 3)
   - Precondition: Package p2 is in truck t2 (true after step 2)
   - Effect: Package p2 is unloaded at l2_2

After these steps, package p1 remains in l2_1 and package p2 is now in l2_2, which satisfies our goal.

This plan seems correct. It's also optimal in terms of the number of actions needed to achieve the goal.

So, my final answer is:

```
drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
```

Actually, let me triple-check by carefully analyzing the problem statement one more time:

I noticed a potential issue: the problem states "loadairplane" twice in the actions list, but the second instance should be "unloadairplane". This is clarified in the preconditions and effects sections, so I'll assume the correct interpretation.

Let's re-analyze:

1. Initial state:
   - Packages: p1 and p2 are both in l2_1
   - Trucks: t1 is in l1_3, t2 is in l2_3
   - Airplanes: a1 is in l1_1, a2 is in l2_1
   - The cities, locations, and airports are as described

2. Goal:
   - p1 should remain in l2_1
   - p2 should be moved to l2_2

3. My plan:
   - Use truck t2 to transport p2 from l2_1 to l2_2
   - No action needed for p1, as it's already at the desired location

The plan I provided seems correct based on this analysis.

```
drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
```

Actually I notice I was a bit too hasty to interpret the problem description. Let me check the information properly one more time:

The description mentions: 

"Package t1 is in location l1_3" and "Package t2 is in location l2_3", which is inconsistent with the domain description (t1 and t2 are trucks, not packages).

Similarly, "Package a1 is in location l1_1" and "Package a2 is in location l2_1" is inconsistent (a1 and a2 are airplanes, not packages).

I'll assume these are typing errors and the correct interpretation is:

- Truck t1 is in location l1_3
- Truck t2 is in location l2_3
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1
- Package p1 is in location l2_1
- Package p2 is in location l2_1

With this interpretation, my plan remains the same:

```
drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
```

The plan is optimal, as it achieves the goal in the minimal number of steps.

Actually let me make SURE I'm checking the problem description precisely. 

The world objects are:
"location l1_2", "location l1_3", "location l1_4", "location l1_5", "location l2_2", "location l2_3", "location l2_4", "location l2_5", "city c1", "city c2", "package p1", "package p2", "truck t1", "truck t2", "airplane a1", "airplane a2", "airport l1_1", "airport l2_1"

The original state of the world is:
"Location l1_1 is in city c1"
"Location l1_2 is in city c1"
"Location l1_3 is in city c1"
"Location l1_4 is in city c1"
"Location l1_5 is in city c1"
"Location l2_1 is in city c2"
"Location l2_2 is in city c2"
"Location l2_3 is in city c2"
"Location l2_4 is in city c2"
"Location l2_5 is in city c2"
"Package t1 is in location l1_3"
"Package t2 is in location l2_3"
"Package p1 is in location l2_1"
"Package p2 is in location l2_1"
"Package a1 is in location l1_1"
"Package a2 is in location l2_1"

Yes, there are inconsistencies. First, l1_1 and l2_1 are described as "airport" in the objects list, but referred to as "Location" in the state description. This is likely just a notational difference, as airports are also locations.

However, the state says "Package t1", "Package t2", "Package a1", "Package a2", which conflicts with the objects list where t1 and t2 are trucks, and a1 and a2 are airplanes.

Given the domain description, I'll interpret these as:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_3
- Truck t2 is in location l2_3
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

The goal is: "Package p1 is in location l2_1", "Package p2 is in location l2_2".

So, p1 is already at its goal location (l2_1), but p2 needs to be moved from l2_1 to l2_2.

My plan remains as previously stated, and I'm confident it's correct:

```
drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
```

Actually, I see a problem: "loadairplane" is listed twice. My assumption is that the second instance should be "unloadairplane," which is supported by the detailed preconditions and effects.

Given this correction, my plan remains unchanged as it doesn't involve airplanes.

In summary, my plan is:

```
drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
```

This is optimal, as we're moving p2 from l2_1 to l2_2 in the most direct way (using 4 actions).

Actually, I just realized that I seem to be misreading the problem; let me be super careful with the world state one more time to make sure I understand it correctly. I'll analyze it step by step:

Looking at the world objects:
- We have two cities: c1 and c2
- We have locations l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5 in c1, and l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5 in c2
- We have two airports: l1_1 (in c1) and l2_1 (in c2)
- We have two packages: p1 and p2
- We have two trucks: t1 and t2
- We have two airplanes: a1 and a2

Looking at the initial state:
- The locations are associated with cities as expected
- Then we have:
  - "Package t1 is in location l1_3"
  - "Package t2 is in location l2_3"
  - "Package p1 is in location l2_1"
  - "Package p2 is in location l2_1"
  - "Package a1 is in location l1_1"
  - "Package a2 is in location l2_1"

This is confusing because t1, t2, a1, and a2 are not packages according to the objects list. Let me assume that there's a typo, and it should read:
  - "Truck t1 is in location l1_3"
  - "Truck t2 is in location l2_3"
  - "Package p1 is in location l2_1"
  - "Package p2 is in location l2_1"
  - "Airplane a1 is in location l1_1"
  - "Airplane a2 is in location l2_1"

This makes more sense, as it's consistent with the object types. And with this interpretation, my plan remains valid.

Hmm wait, I'm rereading the problem and I'm realizing there's a potential mistake in the problem statement. The problem states:

"Truck t1 is in location l1_3" with I interpreted from "Package t1 is in location l1_3"
"Truck t2 is in location l2_3" with I interpreted from "Package t2 is in location l2_3"
"Airplane a1 is in location l1_1" with I interpreted from "Package a1 is in location l1_1"
"Airplane a2 is in location l2_1" with I interpreted from "Package a2 is in location l2_1"

And there's also:
"Package p1 is in location l2_1"
"Package p2 is in location l2_1"

So our objects are:
- Two cities: c1 and c2
- Locations in c1: l1_1 (airport), l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5
- Locations in c2: l2_1 (airport), l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5
- Two packages: p1 and p2
- Two trucks: t1 and t2
- Two airplanes: a1 and a2

Initial state (corrected):
- Truck t1 is in location l1_3
- Truck t2 is in location l2_3
- Package p1 is in location l2_1
- Package p2 is in location l2_1
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

Goal:
- Package p1 should be in location l2_1 (already there)
- Package p2 should be in location l2_2 (currently in l2_1)

So, we need to move p2 from l2_1 to l2_2. Both are in city c2, so a truck can do this.

My plan uses truck t2 (which is in l2_3) to move p2 from l2_1 to l2_2:

```
drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
```

This is optimal, as we're using the minimum number of actions to achieve the goal.

Let me double-check the preconditions and effects for each action:

1. "drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2"
   - Precondition: Truck t2 is in l2_3 (true in initial state)
   - Precondition: l2_3 and l2_1 are both in city c2 (true in initial state)
   - Effect: Truck t2 moves from l2_3 to l2_1

2. "loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1"
   - Precondition: Package p2 and truck t2 are both in l2_1 (true after step 1)
   - Effect: Package p2 is loaded onto truck t2

3. "drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2"
   - Precondition: Truck t2 is in l2_1 (true after step 1)
   - Precondition: l2_1 and l2_2 are both in city c2 (true in initial state)
   - Effect: Truck t2 moves from l2_1 to l2_2

4. "unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2"
   - Precondition: Truck t2 is in l2_2 (true after step 3)
   - Precondition: Package p2 is in truck t2 (true after step 2)
   - Effect: Package p2 is unloaded at l2_2

After these steps, package p1 remains in l2_1 and package p2 is now in l2_2, which satisfies our goal.

I'm confident this plan is correct and optimal.

drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
