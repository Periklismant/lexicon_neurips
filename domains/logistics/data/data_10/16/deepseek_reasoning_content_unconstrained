Okay, let's see. I need to find a plan to get package p1 to location l2_1 and p2 to l2_2, given the initial state and constraints. Wait, wait. The goal says p1 should be in l2_1, but looking at the initial state, p1 is already in l2_1. So maybe that's already satisfied. But p2 is also in l2_1 initially, and the goal is to have p2 in l2_2. So the main task is moving p2 from l2_1 to l2_2. But wait, let me double-check.

Original state: "Package p1 is in location l2_1" and "Package p2 is in location l2_1". The goal is both p1 in l2_1 (which is already true) and p2 in l2_2. So the real goal is just moving p2 to l2_2. But why is the user asking for that? Maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check again.

Yes, the goal is p1 in l2_1 (already there) and p2 in l2_2. So the only action needed is moving p2 from l2_1 to l2_2. Now, how to do that.

Looking at the cities: l2_1 is in city c2, which has locations l2_1 (airport), l2_2, l2_3, etc. So l2_2 is in the same city as l2_1. So a truck can move between them. Let's check the available trucks. The objects include truck t2, which is in l2_3 initially. Wait, the original state says "Package t1 is in location l1_3" and "Package t2 is in location l2_3". Wait, no, wait: the original state says "Package t1 is in l1_3" and "Package t2 is in l2_3". Wait, but t1 and t2 are trucks, right? Because in the objects list, we have "truck t1", "truck t2". But the original state says "Package t1 is in location l1_3" — that can't be right. Wait, maybe that's a typo. Let me check again.

The original state lists:

"Package t1 is in location l1_3"
"Package t2 is in location l2_3"
"Package p1 is in location l2_1"
"Package p2 is in location l2_1"
"Package a1 is in location l1_1"
"Package a2 is in location l2_1"

Wait, that's confusing. Because t1 and t2 are trucks, not packages. Similarly, a1 and a2 are airplanes. So maybe there's a mistake in the original state description. Because the objects include trucks t1 and t2, airplanes a1 and a2, and packages p1 and p2. So perhaps the original state entries for t1, t2, a1, a2 are incorrect. For example, "Package t1" should instead be "Truck t1". Otherwise, the problem is impossible because the trucks are packages, which can't be driven. That must be a typo. Let me assume that the user made a mistake and that the correct initial positions are:

"Truck t1 is in location l1_3"

"Truck t2 is in location l2_3"

"Airplane a1 is in location l1_1"

"Airplane a2 is in location l2_1"

Because otherwise, the problem is impossible. For example, if t1 is a package, then we can't drive it. So assuming that's a typo, I'll proceed.

So initial positions:

- Trucks: t1 in l1_3 (city c1), t2 in l2_3 (city c2)
- Airplanes: a1 in l1_1 (airport in c1), a2 in l2_1 (airport in c2)
- Packages: p1 and p2 in l2_1 (airport in c2)
- Other packages (t1, t2, a1, a2 are not packages but trucks/airplanes)

So the goal is to get p2 to l2_2. Since l2_1 and l2_2 are both in c2, and there's a truck t2 in l2_3. But to move p2 from l2_1 to l2_2, we need a truck in l2_1. So first, we need to move truck t2 from l2_3 to l2_1. But wait, can trucks move between locations in the same city. Yes. So drivetruck t2 from l2_3 to l2_1, city c2. Then, load p2 into t2 at l2_1, drive to l2_2, then unload.

Wait, but initial position of t2 is l2_3. So steps:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2 — moving t2 from current location to l2_1.

But after driving, t2 is in l2_1.

Then, loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1. Because both p2 and t2 are in l2_1.

Then, drive t2 to l2_2: drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2.

Then, unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2.

That's four actions. But let's check if there's any constraints that prevent this.

Constraints are not mentioned in the problem except the ones in the action preconditions. So as long as each action's preconditions are met, it's okay.

So the plan would be:

drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2

unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

But wait, after driving to l2_1, we can load p2. Then drive to l2_2 and unload. Yes. That seems straightforward.

But the problem is that the original state says "Package t2 is in l2_3", which would mean that t2 is a package, not a truck. But given the objects list includes truck t2, this must be an error. So I have to assume that it's Truck t2 in l2_3. So the initial state entries for t1 and t2 are mistyped as Package instead of Truck. So with that correction, the plan works.

Alternatively, if the problem is as written, with t1 and t2 being packages, then we can't use them as trucks. Then the problem is impossible. So to proceed, I'll assume that the initial state has typos and that the trucks are correctly placed.

So the optimal plan is the four steps above. Let me check again.

Yes. Because p2 starts in l2_1. So moving t2 to l2_1, load, drive to l2_2, unload. So that's the minimal steps. No airplanes needed because the movement is within the same city. So that's the plan.
