Alright, I'm tasked with creating a plan to move packages:
- p1 from location l2_1 to location l2_3.
- p2 from location l1_4 to location l1_3.

Let's start by understanding the state of the world:
1. We have 5 locations in each of 2 cities (c1 and c2).
2. The airports are l1_1 (in city c1) and l2_1 (in city c2).
3. Package p1 is at location l2_1 (which is an airport in city c2).
4. Package p2 is at location l1_4 (in city c1).
5. We have 2 trucks (t1 and t2), though I notice there's a typo in the problem description where it says "Package t1 is in location l1_2" and "Package t2 is in location l2_5". I believe it should be "Truck t1 is in location l1_2" and "Truck t2 is in location l2_5".
6. We have 2 airplanes (a1 and a2), though there's another typo stating "Package a1 is in location l1_1" and "Package a2 is in location l2_1". It should be "Airplane a1 is in location l1_1" and "Airplane a2 is in location l2_1".

Let me correct these typos in my mental model:
1. Truck t1 is in location l1_2 (city c1).
2. Truck t2 is in location l2_5 (city c2).
3. Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (airport in city c1).
4. Airplane a2 is in location l2_1 (airport in city c2).

Given the constraints:
- Trucks can move between locations within a city.
- Airplanes can move between airports (l1_1 and l2_1).

For p1 (from l2_1 to l2_3):
1. p1 is at the airport l2_1.
2. We need to transport it to l2_3 within city c2.
3. We can use truck t2, which is at l2_5.

For p2 (from l1_4 to l1_3):
1. p2 is at location l1_4 in city c1.
2. We need to transport it to l1_3 within city c1.
3. We can use truck t1, which is at l1_2.

Now, let's plan the steps:

For p1 (from l2_1 to l2_3):
1. Drive truck t2 from l2_5 to l2_1.
2. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_1.
3. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_3.
4. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_3.

For p2 (from l1_4 to l1_3):
1. Drive truck t1 from l1_2 to l1_4.
2. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_4.
3. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_3.
4. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_3.

Let's formalize the plan using the given action syntax:

For p1:
- drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2  # Drive truck t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 in city c2.
- loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1       # Load package p1 onto truck t2 at location l2_1.
- drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2  # Drive truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_3 in city c2.
- unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3      # Unload package p1 from truck t2 at location l2_3.

For p2:
- drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1  # Drive truck t1 from l1_2 to l1_4 in city c1.
- loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4       # Load package p2 onto truck t1 at location l1_4.
- drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1  # Drive truck t1 from l1_4 to l1_3 in city c1.
- unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3      # Unload package p2 from truck t1 at location l1_3.

Wait, I realized the two sequences are independent, and we want to find the optimal plan. Since the tasks are independent, we can execute them in parallel, and the optimal plan would be the longest of the two sequences. So, our optimal plan would be:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
2. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1
3. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
4. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
5. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
6. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1
7. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
8. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

However, since the instructions ask for the plan, I don't think we need to worry about parallelism. I'll list the steps for both packages:

```
drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
```

Actually, I think I'm making a mistake. The problem says that an optimal plan is a valid plan whose length is equal or less than the length of any other valid plan. This means I should aim for the shortest number of steps.

Given that both packages can be moved independently and the sequence for both are of length 4, the total optimal plan has 8 steps. I can't make it shorter.

Let me re-examine the problem to ensure I'm not missing anything.

Looking back, I think my misunderstanding was assuming that the tasks must be done sequentially. But if we're asked for the optimal plan, and both sequences are independent, they could be executed in parallel. However, I'm not sure that's what the problem is asking for. In a traditional planning context, we often assume that actions are executed sequentially. The fact that the problem is asking for the length of the plan also suggests a sequential execution.

Ok, let me step back. I should actually check if there's a constraint in the problem that I missed which might necessitate a different approach.

I reviewed the problem statement, and there doesn't seem to be any specific constraints that would change my approach. The most straightforward way to solve this problem is to use the trucks to transport the packages to the desired locations.

One last thing I'll check is to make sure I understood the locations and cities correctly.

- l1_1, l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5 are in city c1.
- l2_1, l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5 are in city c2.
- l1_1 and l2_1 are airports.

Given the package and vehicle locations:
- p1 is at l2_1 (airport in city c2).
- p2 is at l1_4 (in city c1).
- t1 is at l1_2 (in city c1).
- t2 is at l2_5 (in city c2).
- a1 is at l1_1 (airport in city c1).
- a2 is at l2_1 (airport in city c2).

Target locations:
- p1 should go to l2_3 (in city c2).
- p2 should go to l1_3 (in city c1).

Since both packages need to be moved within their respective cities, using trucks is straightforward. There's no need to use airplanes for our goals.

The optimal plan remains the same:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
3. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
5. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1
6. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
7. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1
8. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

I believe this is the correct plan to solve our problem.

Wait, there's something not right here. I reread the problem and noticed that there's a mismatch in the action definitions. The action "loadairplane" appears twice, once for loading a package and once for unloading a package. It seems like the second instance should be "unloadairplane". Let me correct this misconception in my plan.

You're right, I misread.  However, my plan doesn't involve airplanes, so it's not affected by this oversight.

Looking at the action syntax again, I want to make sure I'm using the correct format.

```
"loadtruck p t l": Load package p in truck t. Both p and t are in location l.
"loadairplane p ap l": Load package p in airplane ap. Both p and ap are in location l.
"unloadtruck p t l": Unload package p from truck t in location l.
"loadairplane p ap l": Unload package p from airplane ap in location l. (This should be "unloadairplane")
"drivetruck t l_from l_to c": Drive truck t from location l_from to location l_to in city c.
"flyairplane ap l_from l_to": Fly airplane ap from location l_from to location l_to.
```

My plan uses the actions "loadtruck", "unloadtruck", and "drivetruck", which seems correct. I will watch out for the typo in "loadairplane", but it doesn't affect my plan.

Let me double-check that I'm interpreting the syntax correctly:

For "drivetruck t l_from l_to c", the parameter t is the truck, l_from is the starting location, l_to is the destination location, and c is the city.
For example, "drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1" means "Drive truck t1 from location l1_2 to location l1_4 in city c1."

For "loadtruck p t l", the parameter p is the package, t is the truck, and l is the location.
For example, "loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4" means "Load package p2 onto truck t1 at location l1_4."

For "unloadtruck p t l", the parameter p is the package, t is the truck, and l is the location.
For example, "unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3" means "Unload package p1 from truck t2 at location l2_3."

The syntax looks correct, so my plan should be valid.

Actually, I just realized, in the problem description it says "Package t1 is in location l1_2" and "Package t2 is in location l2_5". I believe these should actually be referring to trucks, not packages. So, correcting those, we have:

- Truck t1 is in location l1_2 (in city c1)
- Truck t2 is in location l2_5 (in city c2)

Similarly for "Package a1 is in location l1_1" and "Package a2 is in location l2_1", these should be referring to airplanes:

- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (airport in city c1)
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1 (airport in city c2)

With these corrections in mind, my plan still stands:

```
drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
```

And I'm quite confident that this is the optimal (shortest) valid plan for the problem.
