Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. First, I need to understand the initial state and the goal. The goal is to have package p1 in l2_3 and p2 in l1_3. The initial state has p1 in l2_1 (which is an airport in city c2) and p2 in l1_4 (a location in city c1). There are trucks t1 in l1_2 and t2 in l2_5, airplanes a1 in l1_1 and a2 in l2_1. 

The constraints are quite a lot. Let me list them out to make sure I don't miss any:

1. At least once, p1 must be in l2_2.
2. At least once, both p2 in t2 and p1 in l2_5.
3. At least once, p1 in l2_5.
4. At least once, p2 in a1 or l2_4.
5. At least once, p2 in a2.
6. At least once, p1 in t1 or l1_5.
7. At least once, p2 in l1_4. (Which is already true initially, but maybe needs to happen again?)
8. If p2 is in l1_4 at any state, then p2 must be in l2_3 at that state or later.
9. At least once, p2 in l2_1.
10. At least once, p1 in l2_1. (Which is true initially, but maybe again after moving?)
11. If p1 is in l2_1 at any state, then either p2 in l1_5 or p1 in l1_5 must hold at or after that state.
12. At least once, both p1 in l1_5 and p2 in l1_2.

Hmm, this is a lot. So the plan must not only achieve the goals but also pass through these constraints. Let's start by figuring out how to move p1 and p2 to their destinations, and then see how to incorporate the constraints.

Starting with p1: It's in l2_1 (airport in c2). The goal is l2_3 in c2. Since l2_3 is a city c2 location, maybe use truck t2 which is in l2_5. But to get p1 to l2_3, perhaps drive t2 to l2_1, load p1 into t2, drive to l2_3, unload. But wait, initially, t2 is in l2_5. So steps would be:

For p1:
- Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (but can a truck move from l2_5 to l2_1? Since they are in the same city c2. Are l2_5 and l2_1 connected via city c2? All locations in c2 are l2_1 (airport), l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5. So the truck can drive between any of these. So drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1. Then load p1 into t2. Then drive t2 to l2_3 and unload.

But wait, the initial position of p1 is l2_1. So maybe we can load p1 into a truck or airplane. But since the goal is in the same city, maybe using a truck. But the truck t2 is in l2_5. So first, drive t2 to l2_1, load p1, drive to l2_3, unload. That would work for p1.

For p2: It's in l1_4 (city c1). The goal is l1_3. Truck t1 is in l1_2. So maybe drive t1 to l1_4, load p2, drive to l1_3, unload. That seems straightforward.

But wait, the constraints complicate things. Let's check the constraints that need to be satisfied.

Looking at constraint 2: p2 in t2 and p1 in l2_5. So p2 needs to be in t2 (which is a truck in city c2), but p2 is initially in city c1. So how can p2 get into t2? That would require moving p2 to city c2 first, maybe via airplane. Similarly, constraint 3 requires p1 in l2_5. So perhaps p1 has to go through l2_5 at some point. But the goal is l2_3, so maybe a detour?

Constraint 4: p2 in a1 or l2_4. a1 is in l1_1 (city c1's airport). So getting p2 into a1 would require moving it to l1_1, loading into a1. But then, to get to l2_4 (city c2), perhaps fly a1 to l2_1, then use a truck? But a1 is in c1's airport. To fly between cities, airplanes can go from one airport to another. So maybe fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1, then unload p2 there. But that would be in city c2. But constraint 4 requires p2 in a1 (which is now in l2_1?) or l2_4. If p2 is unloaded from a1 in l2_1, then maybe drive it to l2_4 via truck t2. So that would satisfy the condition.

Constraint 5: p2 in a2. a2 is in l2_1. So maybe load p2 into a2 at l2_1, then unload. But how does p2 get to l2_1? It would need to be transported from city c1 to c2 via airplane.

Constraint 6: p1 in t1 or l1_5. t1 is in city c1, so p1 is in c2. To get p1 into t1, need to transport p1 to city c1. That would require flying it via airplane. So maybe p1 is flown from l2_1 to l1_1 (using a2?), then loaded into t1. But that complicates the plan.

Constraint 7: p2 in l1_4. Which is already true initially, but if during the plan p2 is moved out and then back, we need to ensure that. But the constraint says it must hold in at least one state. So the initial state counts, but perhaps during the plan it's moved away and then brought back. However, the problem says "the following conditions are all true" in the original state. So maybe the initial state is considered state 0, and the constraints can be satisfied there. But the eighth constraint says if p2 is in l1_4, then p2 must be in l2_3 at or after that state. Since the initial state has p2 in l1_4, then according to constraint 8, we must ensure that p2 ends up in l2_3. Which is the goal. So that's already covered. So maybe the initial state's p2 in l1_4 is sufficient for constraint 7, but we need to make sure that after that, p2 is moved to l2_3. But the goal is to have p2 in l1_3. Wait, the goal is p2 in l1_3. But constraint 8 says that if p2 is in l1_4 at any state, then p2 must be in l2_3 (which is a different city) at or after that. So that's a problem. Because the goal for p2 is l1_3 in city c1, but constraint 8 requires that if p2 is ever in l1_4 (which it is initially), then p2 must be in l2_3 (city c2) at some point. But the goal is p2 in l1_3 (city c1). So the plan must first move p2 from l1_4 to l2_3, but then how to get it back to l1_3? That seems conflicting.

Wait, the goal is p2 in l1_3. But according to constraint 8, since p2 starts in l1_4 (so state 0), we must have p2 in l2_3 at some state after. But the goal requires p2 in l1_3. So the plan must move p2 from l1_4 to l2_3 (satisfying constraint 8), then somehow move it back to l1_3. But how? Because l2_3 is in city c2, and l1_3 is in city c1. So p2 would need to be transported back via airplane. But that's possible. So maybe the plan is:

For p2: 

1. Move p2 from l1_4 to l1_1 (airport) via truck t1.
2. Load onto airplane a1, fly to l2_1 (city c2's airport).
3. Unload p2 at l2_1, then drive via truck t2 to l2_3 (satisfying constraint 8).
4. Then, load p2 onto airplane a2 (since a2 is in l2_1, but after step 3, p2 is in l2_3. So need to get it back to l2_1. So drive t2 to l2_3, load p2, drive back to l2_1, load into a2, fly to l1_1, then unload, then use truck t1 to take it to l1_3.

But this is getting very complicated, and may not be optimal. Also, need to satisfy all other constraints.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to satisfy constraint 8 without moving p2 to l2_3. But the initial state already has p2 in l1_4, so according to constraint 8, we must have p2 in l2_3 at some point after. So it's unavoidable. So the plan must include moving p2 to l2_3, then back to l1_3. That's a lot of steps.

Similarly for p1: the goal is l2_3, but initial is l2_1. So maybe drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1, load p1, drive to l2_3. But constraints require p1 to be in l2_5 (constraint 3) and in l2_2 (constraint 1). Also, constraint 2 requires that at some point p2 is in t2 and p1 is in l2_5. So p1 must visit l2_5.

Wait, how can p1 get to l2_5? If the truck t2 is used. Maybe:

For p1:

- Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (load p1 into t2), then drive to l2_5 again (to satisfy constraint 3: p1 in l2_5). Then drive to l2_3. But that would involve:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
3. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2 (now p1 is in t2 at l2_5, so when unloading here, p1 would be in l2_5. But we need to unload it there to satisfy the constraint. But the goal is l2_3. So perhaps:

4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (now p1 is in l2_5, satisfying constraint 3)
5. then load it again into t2, drive to l2_3, unload.

But that adds steps. Also, constraint 2 requires p2 in t2 and p1 in l2_5. So at some point, p2 must be in t2 (which is in c2) and p1 in l2_5. But p2 is initially in c1. So how to get p2 into t2?

This seems to require moving p2 from c1 to c2. Let's think.

For p2:

1. Use truck t1 in c1 to move p2 from l1_4 to l1_1 (airport).
2. Load into airplane a1, fly to l2_1.
3. Unload p2 at l2_1, then load into truck t2 (which is in l2_5, so need to drive t2 to l2_1).
4. So steps for t2 would be: drive to l2_1, load p2, drive to l2_5 (so p2 is in t2 at l2_5, which would satisfy constraint 2 when p1 is in l2_5 (after step 4 above). 

So combining these steps:

For p1:

- Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (action 1)
- Load p1 into t2 (action 2)
- Drive t2 to l2_5 (action 3)
- Unload p1 in l2_5 (action 4, satisfies constraint 3)
- Load p1 again into t2 (action 5)
- Drive to l2_3 and unload (actions 6 and 7)

For p2:

- Truck t1 drives from l1_2 to l1_4 (action a)
- Load p2 into t1 (action b)
- Drive to l1_1 (action c)
- Unload p2 (action d)
- Load into a1 (action e)
- Fly a1 to l2_1 (action f)
- Unload p2 (action g)
- Truck t2 drives from l2_5 to l2_1 (action h, which is already part of p1's steps)
- Load p2 into t2 (action i)
- Drive t2 to l2_5 (action j)
- Unload p2 (action k) or maybe keep it in t2?

But constraint 2 requires that at some state, p2 is in t2 and p1 is in l2_5. So when t2 is at l2_5 with p2 inside and p1 is also in l2_5 (after step 4 of p1's plan), that would satisfy constraint 2.

Wait, when p1 is unloaded in l2_5 (step 4), p1 is in l2_5. At that time, if p2 is in t2 (which is in l2_5?), then yes. So during the same time, t2 is in l2_5, p2 is in t2. So that would satisfy constraint 2.

But how does p2 get into t2? After flying to l2_1, p2 is unloaded there. Then t2 drives to l2_1 (from l2_5) as part of p1's plan (step 1). Then load p2 into t2 (action i). Then drive t2 back to l2_5 (step 3). So during the drive back, p2 is in t2. So when t2 arrives at l2_5, p2 is still in t2. Then, when we unload p1 in l2_5 (step 4), p2 is in t2 (which is at l2_5). So at that state, both p1 is in l2_5 and p2 is in t2. That satisfies constraint 2.

So that's good. Also, constraint 3 is satisfied when p1 is in l2_5 (step 4).

Constraint 1 requires p1 in l2_2. When would that happen? Maybe during the driving steps. For example, if t2 drives from l2_5 to l2_1 via l2_2? Wait, can a truck drive directly between any two locations in the same city, or does it have to go step by step? The problem statement says that "drivetruck t l_from l_to c" is allowed if l_from and l_to are in c. So it can drive directly between any two locations in the same city. So if t2 is in l2_5, driving to l2_1 directly. So no intermediate steps. Therefore, p1 would not pass through l2_2. So how to satisfy constraint 1 (p1 in l2_2)? 

Maybe need to route t2 through l2_2. For example:

After loading p1 into t2 at l2_1 (step 2), drive t2 to l2_2, unload p1 there (satisfies constraint 1), then drive to l2_5. But this adds steps. So:

Modified p1 steps:

1. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (action 1)
2. Load p1 into t2 (action 2)
3. Drive t2 to l2_2 (action 3)
4. Unload p1 (action 4) → p1 in l2_2 (constraint 1 satisfied)
5. Load p1 again into t2 (action 5)
6. Drive to l2_5 (action 6)
7. Unload p1 (action 7) → constraint 3 satisfied
8. Load p1 again into t2 (action 8)
9. Drive to l2_3 (action 9)
10. Unload (action 10)

But this adds more steps. However, the problem requires an optimal plan (shortest possible). So maybe there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, after step 4 (unloading p1 in l2_5), then drive t2 to l2_2, load p1 again, then drive to l2_3. But that would add steps.

Alternatively, maybe after step 4 (p1 in l2_5), drive t2 (without p1) to l2_2, but why? Unless we need to move p1 there. But that would require loading p1 again, which would need to have p1 in l2_5 and t2 there. So perhaps:

After step 4 (p1 in l2_5), drive t2 to l2_2 (action 5), load p1 (action 6), then drive to l2_3 (action 7), unload. This way, p1 is in l2_2 (during step 6 when it's loaded, but wait: loading requires p1 and t2 to be in the same location. So when t2 is in l2_2, p1 is in l2_5. So can't load. Therefore, that approach won't work.

Hmm. So to get p1 into l2_2, perhaps we need to have t2 drive from l2_1 to l2_2, then to l2_5. For example:

1. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (action 1)
2. Load p1 into t2 (action 2)
3. Drive t2 to l2_2 (action 3) → now p1 is in t2 at l2_2. If we unload here, p1 is in l2_2 (satisfies constraint 1). Then:

4. Unload p1 in l2_2 (action 4)
5. Load p1 again (action 5)
6. Drive to l2_5 (action 6)
7. Unload p1 (action 7) → constraint 3
8. Load again, drive to l2_3, unload.

But this adds steps. Is there a way to have p1 in l2_2 without unloading? No, because the condition is that the package is in the location. So p1 must be unloaded in l2_2, or be in a truck that's in l2_2. But constraint 1 says "Package p1 is in location l2_2", which means it's unloaded there. So we must unload p1 there.

This is getting really complicated. Let's try to outline the steps considering all constraints.

Let's list all constraints and see when they can be satisfied:

Constraint 1: p1 in l2_2. Must happen once.

Constraint 2: p2 in t2 and p1 in l2_5. So during the time when t2 is in l2_5 and has p2 inside, and p1 is in l2_5 (unloaded or in another truck? Wait, the constraint says "Package p1 is in location l2_5". So p1 must be in the location, not in a truck. So when p1 is unloaded in l2_5, and p2 is in t2 (which is in l2_5), that's the required state.

Constraint 3: p1 in l2_5. So when we unload p1 there.

Constraint 4: p2 in a1 or l2_4. So either load p2 into a1 (which is in c1's airport) or move p2 to l2_4 (c2).

Constraint 5: p2 in a2. So load p2 into a2, which is in l2_1.

Constraint 6: p1 in t1 or l1_5. t1 is in c1. So how can p1 get there? Must be flown to c1.

Constraint 7: p2 in l1_4. Initially true. But if it's moved, do we need to bring it back? The eighth constraint says that if p2 is ever in l1_4 after the initial state, then it must later be in l2_3. But the goal is p2 in l1_3, so maybe we can avoid moving p2 back to l1_4 after the initial state. However, constraint 7 requires that p2 is in l1_4 in at least one state, which is already satisfied by the initial state. But the eighth constraint applies to any state where p2 is in l1_4, including the initial state. Therefore, since the initial state has p2 in l1_4, we must ensure that p2 is in l2_3 at some point after. Which is part of the plan.

Constraint 9: p2 in l2_1. Which can happen when we unload it from the airplane in l2_1.

Constraint 10: p1 in l2_1. Initially true. But if p1 is moved, then we have to bring it back? Or maybe when p1 is loaded into t2 at l2_1, it's still in l2_1. Wait, when you load a package into a truck, the package is in the truck, which is in the location. So p1 being in t2 at l2_1 counts as being in l2_1. But the constraint says "Package p1 is in location l2_1", which requires it to be in the location, not in a truck. So initially, p1 is in l2_1 (as per the original state). So constraint 10 is already satisfied. But if p1 is moved out, we need to bring it back? Wait, the initial state has p1 in l2_1. So constraint 10 is already met. Unless the problem requires it to be true in a state after the plan starts. But the problem says "the following expression must hold in at least one state". Since the initial state is a state, it's already satisfied. So no need to do anything for constraint 10. However, constraint 11 says that if p1 is in l2_1 at any state (including initial), then either p2 in l1_5 or p1 in l1_5 must hold at or after that state. So since the initial state has p1 in l2_1, we must ensure that in some state after the initial, either p2 is in l1_5 or p1 is in l1_5. 

But the initial state is state 0. The constraints are about any state where p1 is in l2_1. So in the initial state, p1 is in l2_1. Therefore, constraint 11 requires that in the initial state or any state after, either p2 in l1_5 or p1 in l1_5. Since the goal is p1 in l2_3 and p2 in l1_3, neither of which is l1_5, we must have a state after the initial where p2 is in l1_5 or p1 is in l1_5.

So during the plan, we need to have either p2 in l1_5 or p1 in l1_5 at least once.

Constraint 12: p1 in l1_5 and p2 in l1_2. So both must be true at the same state.

This is getting really complex. Let's try to outline a possible plan step by step, ensuring that all constraints are met.

First, handle p1's journey:

Initial location: l2_1 (airport c2).

Goal: l2_3 (city c2).

Constraints for p1: needs to be in l2_2, l2_5, t1 or l1_5, and part of constraint 12.

Possible steps:

1. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1. (drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2)
2. Load p1 into t2. (loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1)
3. Drive t2 to l2_2. (drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2)
4. Unload p1 here. (unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2) → satisfies constraint 1.
5. Load p1 again into t2. (loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2)
6. Drive t2 to l2_5. (drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2)
7. Unload p1 here. (unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5) → satisfies constraint 3.
8. Now, need to get p1 to l2_3. So load into t2 again (if possible).
9. Drive t2 to l2_3 and unload.

But steps 8 and 9 would be:

8. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
9. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_3 c2
10. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 → goal achieved for p1.

Now, during step 7, p1 is in l2_5. Now, for constraint 2: need p2 in t2 and p1 in l2_5. So at step 7, p1 is in l2_5, and if p2 is in t2 (which is in l2_5), then constraint 2 is satisfied. So we need to have p2 in t2 at the same time as p1 is in l2_5.

So p2's journey must include being loaded into t2 at l2_5 while p1 is unloaded there.

Now, how to get p2 into t2:

p2 starts in l1_4 (city c1). Need to move it to city c2, load into t2.

Possible steps:

a. Use truck t1 (in l1_2) to drive to l1_4, load p2.
b. Drive t1 to l1_1 (airport c1).
c. Load p2 into airplane a1 (which is at l1_1).
d. Fly a1 to l2_1 (airport c2).
e. Unload p2 into l2_1.
f. Load p2 into t2 (which is at l2_5 after step 6? Wait, no. After step 6, t2 is at l2_5. But to load p2 into t2, t2 must be at l2_1 where p2 is unloaded. So need to coordinate the timing.

Wait, after step 1: t2 is driven from l2_5 to l2_1. Then steps 1-10 for p1 involve t2 moving around. Meanwhile, p2 needs to be flown to l2_1, then loaded into t2 when t2 is at l2_1.

But in the current p1 plan, t2 is at l2_1 after step 1, then goes to l2_2, l2_5, etc. So to load p2 into t2, perhaps after step 1, when t2 is at l2_1, we can load p2 into t2. But how does p2 get to l2_1?

So let's synchronize:

For p2:

A. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_4 (drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1)
B. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
C. Drive t1 to l1_1 (drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1)
D. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
E. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
F. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
G. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (now p2 is in l2_1)
H. Now, when t2 is at l2_1 (step 1), we can load p2 into t2 (loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1)
But in the p1 plan, after step 1, t2 is at l2_1, and then step 2 loads p1 into t2. So after step 2, t2 has p1. Then we need to load p2 into t2, but t2 can't carry both? Wait, the problem doesn't say trucks have capacity limits, so maybe multiple packages can be loaded. So after step 2 (p1 loaded into t2 at l2_1), load p2 into t2.

So insert step H here:

After step 2 (load p1 into t2), do:

H. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

But wait, p2 is in l2_1 after step G. t2 is in l2_1. So yes, possible.

Then, when t2 drives to l2_2 (step 3), both p1 and p2 are in t2. Then when unloaded at l2_2 (step 4), p1 is unloaded, but p2 remains in t2. Then step 5 loads p1 back into t2. Then drive to l2_5 (step 6). At l2_5, unload p1 (step 7), and p2 is still in t2. So at this point, p1 is in l2_5, and p2 is in t2 (which is at l2_5). This satisfies constraint 2.

Then, after step 7, we can unload p2 from t2 into l2_5 (but that's not needed unless required). But constraint 2 is already satisfied at step 7.

Then, load p1 back into t2 (step 8), drive to l2_3, unload (steps 9-10). But what about p2? It's still in t2. So after step 10, when we unload p1, p2 is still in t2. So we need to unload p2 somewhere else.

Alternatively, after step 7 (p1 unloaded at l2_5), unload p2 from t2 at l2_5:

7a. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5

Then, p2 is in l2_5. But we need to get it to l2_3 for constraint 8. Wait, constraint 8 says that if p2 is in l1_4 (which it was initially), then p2 must be in l2_3 at or after that state. So moving p2 to l2_3 is mandatory.

But the goal for p2 is l1_3. So after moving p2 to l2_3, we need to get it back to l1_3. How?

This is getting too long. Let's try to outline all steps integrating everything.

Plan Steps:

For p2:

1. t1 drives from l1_2 to l1_4 (A)
2. Load p2 into t1 (B)
3. t1 drives to l1_1 (C)
4. Unload p2 at l1_1 (D)
5. Load p2 into a1 (E)
6. Fly a1 to l2_1 (F)
7. Unload p2 at l2_1 (G)
8. Load p2 into t2 (H) [when t2 is at l2_1]
For p1:

9. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (1)
10. Load p1 into t2 (2)
11. Load p2 into t2 (H)
12. Drive t2 to l2_2 (3)
13. Unload p1 at l2_2 (4)
14. Load p1 into t2 (5)
15. Drive to l2_5 (6)
16. Unload p1 at l2_5 (7)
17. At this point, p2 is in t2 at l2_5. So constraint 2 is met.
18. Now, drive t2 to l2_3 (9)
19. Unload p1 (10) → p1 goal met.
20. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_3 (satisfies constraint 8)

Now, p2 is in l2_3, but the goal is l1_3. So need to move it back to c1.

21. Load p2 into airplane a2 (which is at l2_1, but p2 is in l2_3. So need to drive t2 to l2_3, load p2, drive to l2_1, load into a2, fly to l1_1, unload, then truck to l1_3.

But this is getting very long. How to fit this into the plan while meeting all constraints?

Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way. Let's think about the constraints again.

Constraint 12 requires both p1 in l1_5 and p2 in l1_2. So both packages must be in c1. Since p1 starts in c2, need to move it to c1. So perhaps:

After p1 is unloaded at l2_3 (goal), but that's not helpful. Alternatively, during the plan, p1 must be moved to c1 to satisfy constraint 12.

This is getting too complicated. Let's try to outline all steps with the constraints in mind, even if it's long, then see if it can be optimized.

Final Plan Steps:

Actions for p2:

A. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1
B. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
C. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
D. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
E. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
F. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
G. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
H. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (t2 must be at l2_1)

Actions for p1:

I. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
J. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
K. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
L. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (constraint 1)
M. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
N. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
O. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (constraint 3)
P. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
Q. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_3 c2
R. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (goal)

Now, after step G, p2 is in l2_1. Then, step H loads p2 into t2 (which is at l2_1 after step I). Then, t2 drives to l2_2, l2_5, etc. So p2 is in t2 during steps K to O. When step O unloads p1, p2 is still in t2. So at step O, p1 is in l2_5 and p2 is in t2 (at l2_5), satisfying constraint 2.

Now, after step O, p2 is in t2 at l2_5. We need to get p2 to l2_3 to satisfy constraint 8. So:

S. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 → p2 is now in l2_5. But that's not helpful. Instead, drive t2 to l2_3 with p2 inside and unload.

But after step O, t2 is in l2_5 with p1 loaded (step P). Wait, after step O, p1 is unloaded, so in l2_5. Then step P loads p1 into t2 again. So during step P, t2 is at l2_5 with p1 and p2 inside? Or p2 was already in t2?

Wait, step H loaded p2 into t2 at l2_1. Then, t2 moved to l2_2 (step K), then to l2_5 (step N). So during all this time, p2 is in t2. So when step O unloads p1, p2 remains in t2. Then step P loads p1 into t2 (now t2 has p1 and p2). Then drive to l2_3 (Q), unload p1 (R). Then, unload p2 from t2:

S. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 → now p2 is in l2_3 (satisfying constraint 8)

But the goal for p2 is l1_3. So we need to move p2 from l2_3 back to c1.

T. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
U. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
V. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
W. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (a2 is at l2_1)
X. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
Y. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
Z. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (assuming t1 is at l1_1)
AA. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
BB. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 → goal achieved.

But this is way too many steps. Also, need to check other constraints:

Constraint 4: p2 in a1 or l2_4. It was in a1 during step E-F. So constraint 4 is satisfied when p2 is in a1.

Constraint 5: p2 in a2. When we load it into a2 in step W.

Constraint 6: p1 in t1 or l1_5. How? p1 is in c2. To get p1 into t1 (c1), need to fly p1 to c1. For example:

After step R (p1 in l2_3), but that's the goal. Wait, but constraint 6 requires p1 to be in t1 or l1_5 at least once. So during the plan, we need to have p1 in t1 or l1_5. But p1's journey is entirely in c2. So this requires moving p1 to c1, which is not part of the goal. So this complicates things.

To satisfy constraint 6:

We need to transport p1 to c1, either into t1 or l1_5.

So after step R (p1 in l2_3), load p1 into t2 again, drive to l2_1, load into a2, fly to l1_1, unload, then load into t1 and drive to l1_5.

But this adds many steps. However, constraint 6 must be satisfied.

Alternatively, during the plan, perhaps p1 is moved to l1_5. For example:

After p2 is in l1_3, perhaps move p1 to l1_5. But how?

This is getting too long. Maybe there's a shorter way by combining steps.

Alternatively, think of constraint 12: p1 in l1_5 and p2 in l1_2. So both need to be in c1. This would require moving p1 to c1, which is a detour. But maybe during the plan, after moving p2 to l1_3, we can also move p1 to l1_5 and p2 to l1_2. But this seems very involved.

Given the complexity, perhaps the optimal plan is longer than initially expected, but let's try to find a way to meet all constraints with the least steps.

Another approach:

Use airplanes to move packages between cities.

For p1:

- Since it's in l2_1 (c2's airport), load it into airplane a2 (which is at l2_1), fly to l1_1 (c1's airport), unload. Then use truck t1 to move to l1_5. Then fly back to c2. But this would satisfy constraint 6 (p1 in l1_5). Also, this could help with constraint 12.

But this would add steps but may help meet multiple constraints.

But let's see:

For p1:

1. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
2. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
3. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
4. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
5. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
6. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 → satisfies constraint 6 (p1 in l1_5)
7. Now, to get p1 back to c2: load into a1, fly to l2_1, then use t2 to move to l2_3.

But this adds many steps. However, this approach could help meet multiple constraints:

- Constraint 6: p1 in l1_5 (step 6)
- Constraint 12: if during this time, p2 is also in l1_2.

But p2 needs to be in l1_2. To do that:

After moving p2 to l1_3 (goal), drive it to l1_2. But the goal requires p2 in l1_3, so this would undo the goal. Not acceptable.

Alternatively, during the plan, move p2 to l1_2 at some point.

This is getting too involved. Given the time constraints, I'll try to provide a step-by-step plan that meets all the constraints and goals.
