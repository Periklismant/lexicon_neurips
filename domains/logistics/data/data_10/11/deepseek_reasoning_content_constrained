Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. Hmm, the goal is to get p1 to l2_5 and p2 to l1_1. But there are a bunch of constraints to satisfy. Let me start by understanding the initial state and the constraints.

First, the initial state:
- p1 is at l1_5 in c1.
- p2 is at l2_5 in c2.
- Trucks t1 is in l1_5 (wait, the original state says "Package t1 is in location l1_5"? Wait, no, looking back, the original state lists "Package t1" but t1 is a truck. Wait, that must be a typo. Let me check again. The original state says: "Package t1 is in location l1_5" but t1 is a truck. Oh, that's a mistake. Maybe the user made a typo. Because trucks are objects, not packages. Wait, the problem statement says "The world includes the following objects: ... truck t1, truck t2, airplane a1, a2...". So the original state probably has a mistake. It should be "Truck t1 is in location l1_5". Similarly for other trucks. Otherwise, the initial state doesn't make sense. So assuming that "Package t1" is a typo and should be "Truck t1". Otherwise, we can't load t1. So I'll proceed under that assumption.

So, initial locations:
- Trucks: t1 in l1_5 (c1), t2 in l2_3 (c2).
- Airplanes: a1 in l1_1 (c1's airport), a2 in l2_1 (c2's airport).
- Packages: p1 in l1_5, p2 in l2_5.

Goal:
- p1 in l2_5 (which is in c2)
- p2 in l1_1 (which is c1's airport)

Constraints are a lot. Let me list them:

1. At least once, p2 is in l2_5. But initially, p2 is already there. So maybe that's already satisfied. But need to check if that's required to be during the plan. Wait, the constraints say "must hold in at least one state". Since the initial state has p2 in l2_5, that's already true. So that constraint is satisfied without any action. But maybe during the plan, p2 might be moved and then come back. Hmm, but maybe we need to ensure that even if p2 is moved, at some point it's back there. But the initial state already meets that. So perhaps that constraint is automatically satisfied. Wait, but maybe the problem requires that during the plan execution, the constraint is met. For example, if the initial state counts, then the first constraint is satisfied. But maybe the user wants it to happen during the plan. But according to the problem statement, the constraints are about states in the plan. So the initial state is part of the states. So that constraint is already met. But let's confirm.

2. If p2 is in l2_5 at some state s, then p2 must be in l1_2 at s or later. Since in the initial state, p2 is in l2_5, then we need to ensure that in the plan, p2 is in l1_2 at some point after. Because the initial state s0 has p2 in l2_5, so in the plan, after s0, there must be a state where p2 is in l1_2. So the plan must include moving p2 to l1_2 at some point.

3. At least once, p1 is in l1_1. So we need to have p1 at the airport of c1 at some point.

4. If p1 is in l1_1 at some state, there must be an earlier state where p2 is in l1_5 or l1_4. So before moving p1 to l1_1, we need to have p2 in one of those locations.

5. At least once: p2 is in t1 and p1 is in l1_3. So both conditions must hold at the same state.

6. At least once: either p2 in l1_2 or p1 in l2_2. So one of them.

7. At least once: p2 in t1. So this is part of constraint 5, but also needs to be true at least once. But maybe constraint 5 requires it in the same state as p1 in l1_3. So need to have p2 in t1 at least twice? Or maybe once. Wait, constraint 5 says "the following are all true: p2 in t1 and p1 in l1_3". So that state counts for constraint 7 as well. So maybe just once is enough.

8. At least once: p2 is in l1_5.

9. At least once: p1 is in l1_2.

10. At least once: p1 is in a2.

11. At least once: p2 is in t1. Wait, this is same as constraint 7. So maybe redundant, but must be covered.

12. At least once: p1 is in l2_4.

So all these constraints must be met during the plan.

Now, the challenge is to find a sequence of actions that moves p1 from l1_5 to l2_5 and p2 from l2_5 to l1_1, while satisfying all these constraints.

Let's think step by step.

First, moving p1 to l2_5. Since l2_5 is in c2. To get p1 from c1 to c2, we need to use an airplane. So steps could be:

- Move p1 from l1_5 to l1_1 (airport in c1) via truck t1 (since t1 is already in l1_5). Then load into airplane a1, fly to l2_1 (c2's airport), unload, then use truck t2 (which is in l2_3) to drive to l2_5. But t2 is in l2_3. Need to drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1? Wait, l2_1 is an airport in c2. So cities are c1 and c2, each with multiple locations. Trucks can move within their city.

Wait, for p1's journey:

p1 is in l1_5 (c1). To get to c2, need to fly. So steps:

1. Load p1 into t1 (already in l1_5). Then drive t1 to l1_1 (airport). Then unload p1, load into a1. Fly a1 to l2_1 (c2's airport). Then unload p1, load into t2 (but where is t2? Initially, t2 is in l2_3. So need to drive t2 to l2_1. Then load p1 into t2, drive to l2_5, unload. But l2_5 is in c2, so t2 can drive there.

But for p2's journey: p2 starts in l2_5 (c2). Need to get to l1_1 (c1). So similar steps:

Load p2 into t2 (if t2 is in l2_5), drive to l2_1 (airport), load into a2, fly to l1_1, unload, and then maybe use t1 to move if needed. But initial t1 is in l1_5. So if we need to get p2 to l1_1, once it's at l1_1, maybe no further movement is needed, since the goal is l1_1.

But let's outline the steps for both packages.

But also need to satisfy the constraints. Let's list all constraints again and see when they can be met.

Constraints:

1. p2 in l2_5 at least once. Initial state is already true. So covered.

2. If p2 is in l2_5 (which is in initial state), then in s0 or later, p2 must be in l1_2. So we need to move p2 to l1_2 at some point after s0.

3. p1 in l1_1 at least once. So during transport, p1 will be loaded into a1 at l1_1, so when unloading from truck to airplane, that's in l1_1. So that's covered.

4. If p1 is in l1_1 (which happens when loading into a1), there must be an earlier state where p2 is in l1_5 or l1_4. So before moving p1 to l1_1, we need to have p2 in l1_5 or l1_4. But p2 starts in l2_5. So how can we get p2 into c1? Since p2's goal is to be in l1_1, which is in c1. So we need to move p2 from c2 to c1. Let's think: p2 is in l2_5 (c2). Load into t2 (drive to l2_1), then load into a2, fly to l1_1. Then unload into l1_1. But that would be the final step. But to satisfy constraint 4, when p1 is in l1_1 (say, during loading into a1), we need to have p2 in l1_5 or l1_4 in an earlier state. So before moving p1 to l1_1, we need to have p2 in l1_5 or l1_4. But p2 starts in c2. So we need to first move p2 into c1, specifically to l1_5 or l1_4, then move p1 to l1_1. But moving p2 to c1 would require flying to l1_1, then driving to l1_5 or l1_4. Let's think:

For p2's journey:

Original location: l2_5 (c2). To get to l1_1 (c1's airport), steps:

- Load p2 into t2 (truck in l2_3). But p2 is in l2_5. So first, drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_5. Then load p2 into t2. Then drive t2 to l2_1 (airport). Then load p2 into a2. Fly a2 to l1_1. Unload p2. Then done.

But during this process, to meet constraint 4: when p1 is in l1_1 (during its own loading into a1), there must be an earlier state where p2 is in l1_5 or l1_4. So perhaps we need to first move p2 into c1, to l1_5 or l1_4, then move p1 to l1_1. But that complicates things.

Alternatively, maybe we need to have p2 first go to l1_5 or l1_4 before p1 is moved to l1_1. So the order of operations would be:

1. Move p2 from l2_5 to l1_5 or l1_4.

But how? Let's see. To move p2 from c2 to c1, we need to fly. So steps for p2:

- Load p2 into t2 (truck in l2_3? No, p2 is in l2_5. So first, drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_5. Then load p2 into t2. Then drive t2 to l2_1 (airport). Then load p2 into a2. Fly a2 to l1_1. Then unload p2 into l1_1. Then, to get p2 to l1_5 or l1_4, load into t1 (truck in c1's l1_5). But t1 is in l1_5. So we need to drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_1 (airport) to pick up p2. Wait, but p2 is in l1_1 (after being flown there). So load p2 into t1 (if t1 is driven to l1_1). Then drive t1 back to l1_5 or l1_4. Then unload p2 there. This would satisfy constraint 4: p2 is in l1_5 or l1_4 before p1 is moved to l1_1.

But then, after that, we can move p1 to l1_1 (using t1, which is now in l1_5 again? Wait, no. If t1 was driven to l1_1, then after unloading p2 in l1_5, t1 would be in l1_5 again. Wait, perhaps:

Plan steps:

For p2:

1. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_5 (c2). Then load p2 into t2.

2. Drive t2 to l2_1 (airport in c2). Unload p2.

3. Load p2 into a2. Fly a2 to l1_1 (c1's airport). Unload p2. Now p2 is in l1_1.

But we need to get p2 into l1_5 or l1_4 before moving p1 to l1_1. So after p2 is in l1_1, we need to load it into t1 (but t1 is in l1_5). So drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_1 (airport), load p2 into t1, then drive t1 to l1_5 or l1_4 and unload. Then, after that, proceed to move p1 to l1_1.

But this complicates the plan. Let me outline:

Steps for p2 to reach l1_5:

- Fly to l1_1, then use t1 to drive to l1_5.

So steps:

4. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_1 (airport). 

5. Load p2 into t1.

6. Drive t1 back to l1_5, unload p2. Now p2 is in l1_5.

Now, after this, when moving p1 to l1_1 (which is needed for p1's journey to c2), the condition for constraint 4 is met (p2 was in l1_5 in an earlier state).

So the order would be:

First move p2 to l1_5, then move p1 to l1_1.

But then, after moving p2 to l1_5, we have to move p2 again to l1_1 (the goal). Wait, but the goal is p2 in l1_1. So this seems conflicting. Because if p2 is moved to l1_5 first, then later we need to move it back to l1_1. But that's possible.

But this adds steps. Let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps we can have p2 go to l1_4 instead. Maybe that's shorter. But let's proceed.

So, the plan would involve:

For p2:

- From l2_5, via t2 to l2_1, fly to l1_1, then via t1 to l1_5, then via t1 back to l1_1.

But then, after p2 is in l1_5 (to satisfy constraint 4), we need to move p1 from l1_5 to l1_1. So t1 is in l1_5 again. Wait, after driving t1 to l1_5 and unloading p2 there, t1 is in l1_5. Then, load p1 into t1 (since p1 is in l1_5), drive to l1_1, unload p1, load into a1, fly to l2_1, then via t2 to l2_5.

But this is getting complicated. Let's outline the steps.

Possible plan outline:

1. Move p2 from l2_5 to l1_1 via a2, then to l1_5 via t1, then back to l1_1.

But how:

a. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_5 (c2). Load p2 into t2.

b. Drive t2 to l2_1. Unload p2.

c. Load p2 into a2. Fly a2 to l1_1. Unload p2 into l1_1.

Now, p2 is in l1_1. But according to constraint 4, when p1 is in l1_1 (during its loading into a1), there must have been an earlier state where p2 was in l1_5 or l1_4. But currently, p2 is in l1_1. So to satisfy that, we need to move p2 from l1_1 to l1_5 or l1_4 before moving p1 to l1_1.

So, next steps:

d. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_1. Load p2 into t1.

e. Drive t1 to l1_5. Unload p2. Now p2 is in l1_5.

Now, constraint 4 is satisfied because when we later move p1 to l1_1, p2 was in l1_5 before.

Then, proceed with moving p1:

f. Load p1 into t1 (since p1 is in l1_5, and t1 is there). Drive t1 to l1_1. Unload p1.

Now, p1 is in l1_1. Load into a1. Fly to l2_1. Then load into t2 (drive to l2_5), unload.

But then p2 is in l1_5. Need to move it back to l1_1 (the goal). So after step e, p2 is in l1_5. Then after step f, p1 is in l1_1. Then, after moving p1 to l2_5, we need to move p2 from l1_5 back to l1_1. So:

g. Drive t1 (now in l1_1 after step f) back to l1_5. Load p2 into t1. Drive to l1_1. Unload.

But this adds steps. But maybe this is necessary to meet the constraints.

But this is getting very long. Let's check the constraints again:

Constraint 5: At least once, p2 is in t1 and p1 is in l1_3. So in some state, both must be true.

How can we get p1 to l1_3? Maybe during transport. If p1 is in l1_5, to get to l1_1, t1 drives through l1_4, l1_3, etc. Wait, the cities' locations: c1 has l1_1 (airport), l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5. So when driving from l1_5 to l1_1, can the truck go directly, or must it go through intermediate locations? The problem says trucks can move between locations in the same city. So perhaps the drive action can be between any two locations in the same city. So "drivetruck t l_from l_to c" can be done directly. So t1 can drive from l1_5 to l1_1 directly, without passing through other locations. So p1 would be in l1_5, loaded into t1, driven to l1_1. So p1's journey from l1_5 to l1_1 is a single drive action. Thus, p1 doesn't pass through l1_3 unless we make it. To get p1 into l1_3, we need to drive t1 to l1_3. So for constraint 5, which requires p1 to be in l1_3 and p2 in t1 at the same time, perhaps we can have:

At some point, t1 is in l1_3 with p1, and p2 is loaded into t1. But how?

Alternatively, maybe during transporting p2 from l1_5 to l1_1, t1 stops at l1_3. But trucks can move directly between any two locations. So maybe we need to make a detour.

But this complicates the plan. Let's think:

Suppose after step e (p2 is in l1_5), we need to move p1. So:

f. Load p1 into t1 (in l1_5). Drive t1 to l1_3. Unload p1. Now p1 is in l1_3. But how does this help? Then, we need to load p1 again into t1 and drive to l1_1. But that would require two steps. But this allows p1 to be in l1_3, satisfying part of constraint 5. But then, we also need p2 to be in t1 at the same time. So maybe:

At the same time that p1 is in l1_3, p2 is in t1. But how? If t1 is in l1_3 with p1, and p2 is in l1_5. To get p2 into t1, we need t1 to be in l1_5. But t1 is in l1_3. So this seems conflicting. Alternatively, perhaps we can load p2 into t1 when t1 is in l1_5 (after step e). Then drive t1 to l1_3, carrying both p1 and p2? No, packages can't be loaded unless they're in the same location as the truck. So if p2 is in l1_5 (after step e), and t1 is in l1_5, then load p2 into t1. Then drive t1 to l1_3. Then unload p2 there. But then, during the drive from l1_5 to l1_3, both p1 and p2 are in t1. But when is p1 in l1_3? When it's unloaded there. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps after step e (p2 in l1_5), load p2 into t1 (already in l1_5). Then drive t1 to l1_3. Unload p2 there. Then load p1 into t1 (still in l1_5?), but wait, t1 would be in l1_3. So this isn't possible. So this seems complicated.

Alternatively, maybe we can have p2 loaded into t1 in l1_5, then drive to l1_3, unload p2 there. Then p2 is in l1_3, and t1 is there. Then load p1 into t1 (but p1 is in l1_5). Can't do that unless t1 is in l1_5. So this approach isn't working.

Hmm. This constraint is tricky. Let's think of another approach. Maybe during the movement of p2 from l1_5 to l1_1, we can have a stop in l1_3. For example:

After step e (p2 in l1_5), we need to move p2 back to l1_1 (the goal). So:

f. Load p2 into t1 (in l1_5). Drive t1 to l1_3. Unload p2. Now p2 is in l1_3.

g. Drive t1 to l1_5. Load p1 into t1. Drive to l1_3. Unload p1. Now p1 is in l1_3, and p2 is also in l1_3.

But how does this help? We need p2 to be in t1 and p1 in l1_3 at the same state. Wait, maybe:

At step f: after loading p2 into t1 (l1_5), drive to l1_3. While p2 is in t1, and t1 is in l1_3, unload p2. Then, in the same state, p1 is still in l1_5. Not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps during transporting p1 to l1_1, make a stop in l1_3. For example:

Load p1 into t1 (l1_5). Drive to l1_3. Unload p1. Now p1 is in l1_3. Then drive to l1_1. Load p1 into t1 again. But this requires multiple steps. Then, during the time p1 is in l1_3, perhaps p2 can be loaded into t1. But how? Unless t1 is in l1_3 and p2 is also there. Which would require p2 to be moved to l1_3 first.

This seems too convoluted. Maybe there's another way. Let's look at other constraints.

Constraint 6: At least once, p2 in l1_2 or p1 in l2_2. So either one. If we can get p1 to l2_2, that's another option. But l2_2 is in c2. So during p1's journey to l2_5 (which is in c2), perhaps we can make a stop at l2_2. For example, after flying to l2_1, load p1 into t2, drive to l2_2, then to l2_5. That way, p1 is in l2_2 at some point. This would satisfy constraint 6. But we need to decide whether to do that or have p2 in l1_2. Since constraint 2 requires p2 to be in l1_2 after being in l2_5 (which is initially true). So maybe moving p2 to l1_2 is necessary.

Let's focus on constraint 2: after p2 is in l2_5 (which is the initial state), p2 must be in l1_2 at s or later. So p2 has to be moved to l1_2 at some point.

So steps for p2:

From initial l2_5, need to get to l1_2. How? Since l1_2 is in c1. So p2 must be moved to c1. So steps:

1. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_5 (c2). Load p2 into t2.

2. Drive t2 to l2_1 (airport). Unload p2.

3. Load p2 into a2. Fly to l1_1 (c1's airport). Unload p2.

4. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_1. Load p2 into t1.

5. Drive t1 to l1_2. Unload p2. Now p2 is in l1_2, satisfying constraint 2.

Then, later, move p2 to l1_1 (goal).

But this adds steps. Also, during this process, when p2 is in l1_2, that satisfies constraint 6 (since p2 is in l1_2). Also, constraint 9 requires p1 to be in l1_2 at least once. So maybe p1 can also be moved to l1_2.

But let's proceed.

Now, considering all constraints, let's try to outline a plan that meets them all.

Plan outline for p1:

1. Load p1 into t1 (l1_5).

2. Drive t1 to l1_1.

3. Unload p1 into l1_1.

4. Load p1 into a1.

5. Fly a1 to l2_1.

6. Unload p1 into l2_1.

7. Load p1 into t2 (drive to l2_1, but t2 is in l2_3 initially).

Wait, t2 starts in l2_3. So to load p1 into t2, we need t2 to be in l2_1. So steps for t2:

a. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1.

b. Load p1 into t2.

c. Drive t2 to l2_5.

d. Unload p1.

So for p1's journey:

Steps 1-5 as above, then:

6. Unload p1 in l2_1.

7. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1 (step a).

8. Load p1 into t2 (step b).

9. Drive t2 to l2_5 (step c).

10. Unload p1 (step d).

Now, for p2's journey:

1. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_5 (but wait, t2 is needed for p1's journey. So perhaps we need to handle p2 first.)

Alternatively, handle p2 first.

But this is getting complicated. Let's try to interleave steps.

Overall plan outline:

1. For p2:

   a. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_5. Load p2 into t2.

   b. Drive t2 to l2_1. Unload p2.

   c. Load p2 into a2. Fly a2 to l1_1. Unload p2.

   d. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_1. Load p2 into t1.

   e. Drive t1 to l1_2. Unload p2. (Satisfies constraint 2 and 6)

   f. Drive t1 back to l1_1. Load p2 into t1. Drive to l1_5. Unload p2. (Satisfies constraint 8 and 4, since p2 is in l1_5. Now, when p1 is moved to l1_1 later, constraint 4 is met.)

2. For p1:

   a. Load p1 into t1 (l1_5). Drive to l1_1. Unload. (Now p1 is in l1_1, satisfying constraint 3. But constraint 4 requires that before this step, p2 was in l1_5 or l1_4. Which it was in step f above.)

   b. Load p1 into a1. Fly to l2_1. Unload.

   c. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1. Load p1 into t2. Drive to l2_5. Unload. (p1 reaches goal.)

3. For p2's final steps:

   a. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_1. Load p2 into t1. Drive to l1_1. Unload. (p2 reaches goal.)

Now, let's check constraints:

- Constraint 1: p2 in l2_5 initially. Covered.

- Constraint 2: p2 in l2_5 (initial), then later in l1_2. Covered in step e.

- Constraint 3: p1 in l1_1 during step 2a. Covered.

- Constraint 4: before step 2a (p1 in l1_1), p2 was in l1_5 in step f. Covered.

- Constraint 5: p2 in t1 and p1 in l1_3. Not covered yet. How?

Hmm, need to find a state where both are true. Let's see.

During step 1e, p2 is in l1_2. During step 2a, p1 is in l1_1. How can we get p1 to l1_3?

Maybe during step 2a, after loading p1 into t1 (l1_5), drive to l1_3 first, unload, then drive to l1_1.

So modified steps:

2a. Load p1 into t1 (l1_5).

2b. Drive t1 to l1_3. Unload p1. (Now p1 is in l1_3.)

2c. Load p1 into t1 again (but t1 is in l1_3). Drive to l1_1. Unload.

This way, p1 is in l1_3 at step 2b. Now, to have p2 in t1 at the same time.

When is p2 in t1? For example, during step 1d, p2 is loaded into t1. Then driven to l1_2 (step 1e). So during step 1d and 1e, p2 is in t1. But p1 is in l1_3 during step 2b. So those are different states. So how to have both in the same state.

Alternatively, maybe when p2 is being moved from l1_1 to l1_2, and p1 is being moved from l1_5 to l1_3. But that requires overlapping steps.

Alternatively, perhaps during step 1e (driving t1 to l1_2 with p2), make a stop in l1_3. But trucks can move directly. So if t1 is in l1_1, loaded with p2, and we drive to l1_3, then to l1_2. Then, during the drive to l1_3, p2 is in t1. If at the same time, p1 is in l1_3, but how?

Alternatively, after unloading p2 in l1_2 (step 1e), drive t1 back to l1_3. Then load p2 again into t1. Then drive to l1_3. But this seems forced.

Alternatively, after step 1f (p2 in l1_5), when p1 is loaded into t1 (step 2a), drive t1 to l1_3, unload p1 there. Then p1 is in l1_3. Then, load p2 into t1 (which is in l1_3?), but p2 is in l1_5. So no, can't load.

Hmm. This is challenging. Let's think of another approach. Perhaps during the step when p2 is in l1_5 (step 1f), and p1 is loaded into t1 (step 2a), we can drive t1 to l1_3, unload p1 there (p1 in l1_3), then load p2 into t1 (which is in l1_5?), but t1 is in l1_3 now. So no.

Alternatively, after step 1f, p2 is in l1_5. Then, drive t1 to l1_5, load both p1 and p2 into t1. Then drive to l1_3, unload p1. Then p1 is in l1_3 and p2 is still in t1. But trucks can carry multiple packages, but each load action is per package. So you can load p1 into t1, then load p2 into t1 if both are in the same location. So steps:

After step 1f (p2 in l1_5, t1 in l1_5):

2a. Load p1 into t1 (l1_5).

2b. Load p2 into t1 (l1_5). Now both packages are in t1.

2c. Drive t1 to l1_3. Unload p1. Now p1 is in l1_3, p2 remains in t1.

This satisfies constraint 5: p2 is in t1 and p1 is in l1_3. Also, constraint 7 and 11 (p2 in t1) are covered here.

Then, continue:

2d. Drive t1 (with p2) to l1_1. Unload p2. Now p2 is in l1_1 (goal). But wait, no, the goal is for p2 to be in l1_1. So this would complete p2's journey. But also, p1 is in l1_3.

Then, to move p1 to l2_5:

3. Load p1 into t1 (l1_3). Drive to l1_1. Unload.

4. Load p1 into a1. Fly to l2_1. Unload.

5. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1. Load p1. Drive to l2_5. Unload.

This way, all constraints are satisfied.

Let's outline the full plan with these steps:

Step 1: Move p2 from l2_5 to l1_5, then load into t1 with p1, drive to l1_3.

But let's detail each action:

1. Initial steps for p2:

   a. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_5 (c2). Action: drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2.

   b. Load p2 into t2. Action: loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5.

   c. Drive t2 to l2_1. Action: drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2.

   d. Unload p2. Action: unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.

   e. Load p2 into a2. Action: loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1.

   f. Fly a2 to l1_1. Action: flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

   g. Unload p2 from a2. Action: unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1.

   h. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_1. Action: drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1.

   i. Load p2 into t1. Action: loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

   j. Drive t1 to l1_5. Action: drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1.

   k. Unload p2. Action: unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5. (Now p2 is in l1_5, satisfying constraint 4 and 8.)

2. Now, handle p1 and meet constraint 5:

   l. Load p1 into t1 (l1_5). Action: loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5.

   m. Load p2 into t1 (l1_5). Action: loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5. (Now both p1 and p2 are in t1.)

   n. Drive t1 to l1_3. Action: drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1.

   o. Unload p1. Action: unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3. (Now p1 is in l1_3, p2 is still in t1. This satisfies constraint 5.)

3. Continue moving p2 to l1_1:

   p. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1. Action: drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1.

   q. Unload p2. Action: unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1. (p2 reaches goal.)

4. Move p1 to l2_5:

   r. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_3. Action: drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1.

   s. Load p1 into t1. Action: loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3.

   t. Drive t1 to l1_1. Action: drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1.

   u. Unload p1. Action: unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1.

   v. Load p1 into a1. Action: loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1.

   w. Fly a1 to l2_1. Action: flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1.

   x. Unload p1. Action: unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1.

   y. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1. Action: drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2.

   z. Load p1 into t2. Action: loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1.

   aa. Drive t2 to l2_5. Action: drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2.

   bb. Unload p1. Action: unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5. (p1 reaches goal.)

Now, check other constraints:

- Constraint 9: p1 in l1_2. Not covered yet. How?

In the current plan, p1 is in l1_3 and l1_1. To get p1 to l1_2, we can modify step t and u:

After step t (drive t1 to l1_1), maybe drive to l1_2 first. But that would add steps. Alternatively, after step o (p1 in l1_3), drive t1 to l1_2, unload p1 there. But that would require:

After step o (unload p1 in l1_3):

   o. Unload p1 in l1_3.

   p. Drive t1 to l1_2. Unload p2 there? No, p2 is still in t1.

Wait, no. After step o, p1 is in l1_3, p2 is in t1. Then step p is driving t1 to l1_1. So during that drive, p2 is in t1. To get p1 to l1_2, maybe after step o, drive t1 to l1_2, unload p1 there. But p1 is not in t1 anymore. Alternatively, after step o, p1 is in l1_3. To get p1 to l1_2, we need to load it into t1 again. But t1 is in l1_3 after step o. So:

After step o:

   p. Load p1 into t1 (l1_3). Action: loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3.

   q. Drive t1 to l1_2. Action: drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1.

   r. Unload p1. Action: unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2. (Now p1 is in l1_2, satisfying constraint 9.)

   s. Then proceed to drive t1 to l1_1 with p2.

But this adds steps. However, this would satisfy constraint 9. Also, constraint 6: either p2 in l1_2 or p1 in l2_2. With p1 in l1_2, this is covered.

Additionally, constraint 10: p1 must be in a2. Currently, p1 is loaded into a1. So how to get p1 into a2? Hmm. This is a problem. Because in the current plan, p1 is loaded into a1, not a2. So constraint 10 is not satisfied. So we need to find a way to have p1 in a2 at some point.

This adds another layer of complexity. To satisfy constraint 10, p1 must be loaded into a2. But a2 is in l2_1 initially. So to load p1 into a2, a2 must be in the same location as p1. Which would require flying a2 to l1_1. But a2 starts in l2_1. So steps would be:

- Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1. Then load p1 into a2. Then fly back.

But this would require extra steps. Let's adjust the plan.

After step u (p1 in l1_1), instead of loading into a1, we can:

v. Fly a2 to l1_1. Action: flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

w. Load p1 into a2. Action: loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1. (Now p1 is in a2, satisfying constraint 10.)

x. Fly a2 back to l2_1. Action: flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1.

y. Unload p1. Action: unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1.

Then proceed as before.

This way, p1 is in a2 during step w, satisfying constraint 10.

But this adds steps. Let's see:

So inserting steps v and w after step u:

u. Unload p1 into l1_1.

v. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1. Action: flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

w. Load p1 into a2. Action: loadairplane p1 a2 l1_1.

x. Fly a2 back to l2_1. Action: flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1.

y. Unload p1 into l2_1.

Then continue with steps y to bb (drive t2 to l2_1, load p1, etc.).

This adds three more actions (fly a2 to l1_1, load, fly back), but ensures p1 is in a2.

Now, let's check constraint 12: p1 must be in l2_4 at least once. In the current plan, p1 is driven from l2_1 to l2_5 via t2. To get p1 to l2_4, we can drive t2 through l2_4. So modify step aa (drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_5) to go via l2_4. But since trucks can move directly, we can have:

aa. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_4. Action: drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2.

ab. Unload p1. (No, we need to keep p1 in t2 until l2_5. Alternatively, drive to l2_4, then to l2_5, but that adds steps. Alternatively, unload p1 in l2_4, then load again. But that's not efficient.

Alternatively, after unloading p1 in l2_1, drive t2 to l2_4, then to l2_5. So:

y. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1. (Wait, earlier steps: after step x, a2 is in l2_1, p1 is unloaded there. Then, drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1 (as before). Load p1 into t2. Drive t2 to l2_4. Unload p1. Then load again into t2 and drive to l2_5. This adds steps but satisfies constraint 12.

But this is getting too long. Let's think of another way. Maybe during the drive from l2_1 to l2_5, the truck passes through l2_4. So the action is drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2. But the problem states that trucks can move between any two locations in the same city directly. So if we drive directly to l2_5, p1 is never in l2_4. So to get p1 into l2_4, we need to make a stop there.

So:

After loading p1 into t2 in l2_1:

   Drive t2 to l2_4. Unload p1. Then load again and drive to l2_5.

But this adds two steps. But it's necessary to satisfy constraint 12.

So steps:

y. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1. Action: drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2.

z. Load p1 into t2. Action: loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1.

aa. Drive t2 to l2_4. Action: drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2.

ab. Unload p1. Action: unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4. (Satisfies constraint 12.)

ac. Load p1 into t2 again. Action: loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4.

ad. Drive t2 to l2_5. Action: drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2.

ae. Unload p1. Action: unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5.

Now, all constraints are met:

- p1 is in l2_4 (step ab).

- p2 is in l1_5 (step k), l1_2 (step e), etc.

But this makes the plan very long. We need to ensure the plan is optimal (shortest possible). So maybe there's a shorter way.

Alternatively, maybe after flying p1 to l2_1, we drive t2 to l2_4 first, then to l2_5. So:

After step y (p1 in l2_1):

   Load into t2, drive to l2_4, unload (satisfy constraint 12), then load again and drive to l2_5.

But this adds steps.

Given all the constraints, the plan must include these steps. So despite being lengthy, this seems necessary.

Now, putting it all together, the plan would have many steps. But the problem asks for an optimal plan, i.e., the shortest possible. So perhaps there's a more efficient way.

Alternative approach: Find overlapping steps where multiple constraints are satisfied in fewer actions.

For example, when p2 is in t1 and p1 is in l1_3 (constraint 5), we can arrange for that state to also satisfy other constraints.

Similarly, moving p1 through l2_2 (constraint 6) instead of moving p2 to l1_2.

But let's try to see:

If we move p1 through l2_2, then constraint 6 is satisfied. So instead of moving p2 to l1_2, we can have p1 in l2_2. This would avoid needing to move p2 to l1_2, which saves steps. But then constraint 2 requires p2 to be in l1_2 after being in l2_5. So we have to do that regardless.

Thus, constraint 2 must be addressed.

So, regardless, p2 has to be moved to l1_2.

Another idea: When p2 is in t1 and being driven to l1_2, maybe we can unload p2 in l1_2, which satisfies constraint 2 and 6. Then, later, move p2 to l1_1.

Now, considering all constraints, let's try to outline the optimal plan:

1. Move p2 from l2_5 to l1_2 via a2 and t1.

2. Move p1 from l1_5 to l2_5 via a1 and t2.

3. Ensure all other constraints are met during these movements.

Let's outline:

For p2:

a. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_5. Load p2.

b. Drive t2 to l2_1. Unload.

c. Load p2 into a2. Fly to l1_1. Unload.

d. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_1. Load p2.

e. Drive t1 to l1_2. Unload. (Satisfies constraint 2 and 6.)

For p1:

f. Load p1 into t1 (l1_5). Drive to l1_3. Unload. (Satisfies constraint 5 if p2 is in t1.)

Wait, but p2 is in l1_2 at this point, not in t1. So this doesn't work.

Alternative:

During p2's movement, when p2 is in t1 (step d and e), if we can have p1 in l1_3 at the same time.

But how? Maybe:

After step d (p2 loaded into t1 in l1_1), drive t1 to l1_3, unload p2 there. Then p2 is in l1_3. Then drive t1 to l1_2. But this doesn't help.

Alternatively, after step d (t1 in l1_1 with p2), drive t1 to l1_3, unload p2 there (satisfies constraint 5 if p1 is in l1_3). But p1 is still in l1_5. So need to move p1 to l1_3.

This seems too tangled. Given the time constraints, perhaps the initial detailed plan with all necessary steps is the way to go, even if it's long. But the problem requires an optimal (shortest) plan, so I need to find a way to minimize steps.

Another idea: Use airplanes to carry both packages. But airplanes can only move between airports.

For example, after moving p2 to l1_1, load into a1 and fly back to c2. But that doesn't help.

Alternatively, have a1 carry p1 to c2, and a2 carry p2 to c1.

But how to get p2 into a2.

Wait, initial positions:

a1 is in l1_1, a2 in l2_1.

So for p2's journey:

p2 starts in l2_5. Drive t2 to l2_5, load, drive to l2_1, load into a2, fly to l1_1. Then, in l1_1, load into t1 and drive to l1_2, then to l1_1.

For p1's journey: load into t1, drive to l1_1, load into a1, fly to l2_1, then drive to l2_5.

But during these steps, how to meet all constraints.

Let me try to outline the plan with minimal steps:

1. Move p2 to l1_1:

   a. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2

   b. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5

   c. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2

   d. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

   e. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

   f. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

   g. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

2. Move p2 to l1_2 to satisfy constraint 2:

   h. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1

   i. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

   j. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1

   k. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

3. Move p2 back to l1_1 (goal):

   l. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1

   m. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

   n. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

4. Move p1 to l2_5:

   o. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5

   p. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1

   q. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

   r. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

   s. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

   t. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

   u. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

   v. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

   w. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2

   x. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

But this plan doesn't meet all constraints:

- Constraint 5: p2 in t1 and p1 in l1_3. Not met.

- Constraint 7: p2 in t1. Met in step i and m.

- Constraint 8: p2 in l1_5. Not met.

- Constraint 9: p1 in l1_2. Not met.

- Constraint 10: p1 in a2. Not met.

- Constraint 12: p1 in l2_4. Not met.

So this plan is insufficient.

Thus, the initial detailed plan is necessary to meet all constraints. Even though it's long, it's required.
