Let me analyze this problem step by step:

First, I need to understand what's going on in the initial state:
- We have two cities: c1 and c2
- Each city has 5 locations:
  - c1: l1_1 (airport), l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5
  - c2: l2_1 (airport), l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5
- Packages and vehicles:
  - p1 is at l1_5 (in city c1)
  - p2 is at l2_5 (in city c2)
  - t1 is at l1_5 (in city c1)
  - t2 is at l2_3 (in city c2)
  - a1 is at l1_1 (airport in city c1)
  - a2 is at l2_1 (airport in city c2)

Wait, I think there's an issue with the initial state as provided. It refers to packages t1, t2, a1, and a2, but these should be trucks and airplanes, not packages. Let me assume the correct interpretation is:
- Truck t1 is at l1_5 (in city c1)
- Truck t2 is at l2_3 (in city c2)
- Airplane a1 is at l1_1 (airport in city c1)
- Airplane a2 is at l2_1 (airport in city c2)
- Package p1 is at l1_5 (in city c1)
- Package p2 is at l2_5 (in city c2)

The goal is to have:
- p1 at l2_5 (in city c2)
- p2 at l1_1 (in city c1)

So I need to transport p1 from l1_5 in c1 to l2_5 in c2, and p2 from l2_5 in c2 to l1_1 in c1.

Let's think through a plan:

For p1 (l1_5 to l2_5):
1. Load p1 onto truck t1 at l1_5
2. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_1 (the airport in c1)
3. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1
4. Load p1 onto airplane a1 at l1_1
5. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1 (the airport in c2)
6. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1
7. Load p1 onto truck t2 at l2_1 (but t2 is at l2_3, so we need to move it first)
   a. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1
   b. Load p1 onto t2 at l2_1
8. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_5
9. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_5

For p2 (l2_5 to l1_1):
1. We need to get a truck to l2_5 to pick up p2
   a. Truck t2 will be at l2_5 after delivering p1
2. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_5
3. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (the airport in c2)
4. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1
5. Load p2 onto an airplane at l2_1 (a1 or a2)
   a. a1 will be at l2_1 after delivering p1
   b. So we can load p2 onto a1 at l2_1
6. Fly a1 from l2_1 to l1_1 (the airport in c1)
7. Unload p2 from a1 at l1_1

Let's validate this plan now, focusing on one package at a time:

For p1:
1. p1 and t1 are both at l1_5, so we can load p1 onto t1
2. t1 is at l1_5, so we can drive it to l1_1 in city c1
3. t1 and p1 are at l1_1, so we can unload p1 from t1
4. p1 and a1 are at l1_1, so we can load p1 onto a1
5. a1 is at l1_1, so we can fly it to l2_1
6. a1 and p1 are at l2_1, so we can unload p1 from a1
7. t2 is at l2_3, so:
   a. We drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1
   b. Now t2 and p1 are at l2_1, so we can load p1 onto t2
8. t2 is at l2_1, so we can drive it to l2_5 in city c2
9. t2 and p1 are at l2_5, so we can unload p1 from t2

For p2:
1. After delivering p1, t2 will be at l2_5, where p2 is located, so we can load p2 onto t2
2. t2 is at l2_5, so we can drive it to l2_1
3. t2 and p2 are at l2_1, so we can unload p2 from t2
4. a1 is at l2_1 after flying from l1_1, so we can load p2 onto a1
5. a1 is at l2_1, so we can fly it to l1_1
6. a1 and p2 are at l1_1, so we can unload p2 from a1

This plan seems sound. Let me write out the final sequence of actions:

1. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
2. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
3. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
4. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
6. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
7. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
8. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
9. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
10. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
11. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
12. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
13. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
14. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
15. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
16. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

Actually, I see an issue: I'm using "loadairplane" both for loading and unloading packages from airplanes. Let me check the correct actions:
- To load packages onto an airplane: "loadairplane p ap l"
- To unload packages from an airplane: there seems to be a mistake in the problem description. It lists "loadairplane" again for unloading, which is incorrect. It should probably be "unloadairplane".

Let me assume the correct action for unloading from an airplane is "unloadairplane p ap l".

Let me correct the plan:

1. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
2. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
3. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
4. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
6. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
7. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
8. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
9. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
10. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
11. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
12. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
13. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
14. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
15. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
16. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

Actually, I was right: In the domain description, the unload action for an airplane is listed as:
"loadairplane p ap l": Unload package p from airplane ap in location l.

Which is confusing, since the same action name is used for both loading and unloading. Let's assume that's a typo and the action should be:
"unloadairplane p ap l": Unload package p from airplane ap in location l.

So I'll stick with the corrected plan above.

Now let me double-check if this plan is optimal:

For p1:
- We need to use a truck to get from l1_5 to the airport l1_1 in c1
- We need to fly to get from city c1 to city c2
- We need to use a truck to get from the airport l2_1 to l2_5 in c2

For p2:
- We need to use a truck to get from l2_5 to the airport l2_1 in c2
- We need to fly to get from city c2 to city c1

This seems optimal as we're using the most direct routes for both packages. One potential optimization is to use both airplanes a1 and a2 for parallel transportation, but it doesn't seem necessary here as we're just moving two packages sequentially.

Let me double-check for other possible optimizations:

1. Could we use t1 for p2's transport within c1? No, t1 would end up at l1_1 after dropping p1, and p2 will arrive at l1_1 via airplane, so there's no need for additional truck transport.

2. Could we use a2 for p2's transport? Yes, we could use airplane a2 instead of a1 for p2's journey, but since a1 would already be at l2_1 after delivering p1, it's more efficient to use a1.

3. Could we change the order of operations? We could potentially transport p2 first, but it would still require the same number of steps.

The plan seems optimal to me. Let me finalize it:

1. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
2. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
3. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
4. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
6. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
7. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
8. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
9. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
10. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
11. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
12. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
13. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
14. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
15. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
16. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

Ah, now I see another possible optimization. We don't explicitly need p1 to be at l2_5 at the same time p2 is at l1_1. So we could handle these moves in parallel:

P1 Journey:
1. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
2. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
3. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
4. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
6. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
7. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
8. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
9. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
10. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

P2 Journey:
1. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
2. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
3. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
4. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1  (using a2 instead of a1)
5. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
6. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

But this introduces an issue: t2 needs to be at l2_5 to pick up p2, but it starts at l2_3. We need to drive it to l2_5 first, and the only way to get it there (based on our current plan) is by having it deliver p1. So it seems like our original sequential plan (p1 followed by p2) is still the most efficient.

Actually, hold on, I think I misunderstood the initial state. Let me reread it:

"Package t1 is in location l1_5"
"Package t2 is in location l2_3"
"Package p1 is in location l1_5"
"Package p2 is in location l2_5"
"Package a1 is in location l1_1"
"Package a2 is in location l2_1"

This doesn't make sense because t1, t2, a1, and a2 should be trucks and airplanes, not packages. I think this is a typo in the problem description. Let me assume the corrected initial state is:

"Truck t1 is in location l1_5"
"Truck t2 is in location l2_3"
"Package p1 is in location l1_5"
"Package p2 is in location l2_5"
"Airplane a1 is in location l1_1"
"Airplane a2 is in location l2_1"

With this understanding, my original plan still holds. Let me provide the final plan:

1. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
2. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
3. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
4. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
6. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
7. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
8. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
9. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
10. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
11. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
12. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
13. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
14. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
15. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
16. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

But let me double-check if there's a more optimal solution:

Could we transport p2 in parallel with p1?
- p2 starts at l2_5
- We need to get it to l1_1
- t2 starts at l2_3, so we'd need to move it to l2_5 to pick up p2
- a2 starts at l2_1, so we'd need to move p2 to l2_1 to load it onto a2

I think the most efficient approach would be something like:

For p1 (using t1 and a1):
1. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
2. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
3. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
4. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
6. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
7. (At this point, we need a truck to get p1 to l2_5, which is t2)

For p2 (using t2 and a2 in parallel with p1's transport):
1. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2
2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
3. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
5. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
6. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
7. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

After p2 is transported, we can continue with p1:
8. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
9. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
10. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

But this introduces an issue: we need t2 to pick up p1 at l2_1, but t2 will be at l2_1, drop off p2, and then (in the current plan) t2 would go with p1 to l2_5. But we also need t2 to go to l2_5 to pick up p2.

Actually, my mistake - these plans involve a circular dependency. Let me think again:

For p1 (using t1 and a1):
1. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
2. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
3. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
4. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
6. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

For p2 (using t2 and a2):
1. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2
2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
3. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
5. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
6. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
7. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

After p2 is dropped off, we can use t2 to pick up p1 and transport it to l2_5:
7. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
8. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
9. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

So both packages can be transported in parallel until p2 is delivered, and then t2 can be used to complete p1's journey.

This gives us a plan with 16 steps:

1. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
2. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
3. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
4. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
6. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2
7. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
8. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
9. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
10. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
11. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
12. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
13. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
14. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
15. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
16. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

But this is still 16 steps, which is the same as our original sequential plan. And there's a potential issue with concurrency: we're assuming that actions 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 can all happen simultaneously, or at least in a specific order.

To ensure correctness, let's be explicit about the ordering of these actions:
9. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
10. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
11. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
12. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
13. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
14. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
15. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
16. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

This is still 16 steps, which is the same as our original sequential plan.

Actually, we can make one optimization: we can use a2 to transport p1 from l2_1 to l2_5 instead of using t2, which would eliminate a few steps. Let me try:

1. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
2. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
3. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
4. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
6. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
7. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
8. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l2_5
9. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_5

Wait, that doesn't work because a2 can only fly between airports, not any locations.

Let me double-check the domain description:
- Airplanes can fly between airports.
- In the problem, l1_1 and l2_1 are airports.

So my original plan does stand, and I don't see a way to optimize it further:

1. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
2. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
3. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
4. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
6. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
7. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
8. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
9. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
10. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
11. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
12. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
13. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
14. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
15. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
16. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

Wait, there's one more consideration: the parallel plan I constructed seems to involve 16 sequential steps, but some of these steps could be done concurrently. For instance, while p1 is being flown from l1_1 to l2_1, t2 could be driven from l2_3 to l2_5 to pick up p2. This would make the plan more efficient in terms of total time, even if the number of steps remains the same.

However, the problem statement asks for an "optimal plan" in terms of the length (number of steps), not in terms of total time considering concurrency. So, I think the plan I constructed is optimal in terms of the number of steps.

But let me double-check if the original plan is really 16 steps, or if I miscounted:

1. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
2. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
3. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
4. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
6. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
7. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
8. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
9. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
10. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
11. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
12. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
13. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
14. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
15. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
16. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

Yes, that's indeed 16 steps. Now let me also double-check the parallel plan I was thinking about:

1. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
2. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
3. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
4. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
6. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2  (concurrent with 4 and 5)
7. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
8. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
9. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
10. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
11. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
12. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
13. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
14. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
15. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
16. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

So both plans require 16 steps, but the parallel plan might be more efficient in terms of total time due to concurrency.

However, since the problem asks for an optimal plan in terms of length (number of steps), I'll stick with the original plan, which is easier to validate and ensures that each action can be performed given the preconditions.

1. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
2. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
3. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
4. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
6. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
7. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
8. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
9. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
10. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
11. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
12. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
13. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
14. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
15. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
16. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

This is the optimal plan for the problem.

Actually, after reviewing the problem one more time, there's one last idea I want to check:

Can we transport both packages in the same vehicle, since they're going to opposite cities? For instance, can we:
1. Load p1 onto a truck in c1
2. Drive to the airport in c1
3. Load p1 onto airplane a1
4. Fly to the airport in c2
5. Leave p1 at the airport in c2
6. Load p2 onto the same airplane a1
7. Fly back to the airport in c1
8. Unload p2 at the airport in c1
9. Use a truck to transport p1 from the airport in c2 to its final location

This would reduce the number of airplane trips. But the challenge is that p2 starts at l2_5, not at the airport l2_1, so we'd still need a truck to get it to the airport. So this approach wouldn't save us any steps.

I believe the plan I've presented is optimal:

1. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
2. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
3. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
4. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
6. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
7. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
8. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
9. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
10. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
11. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
12. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
13. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
14. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
15. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
16. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
