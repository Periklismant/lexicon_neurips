Okay, let me try to figure out how to get package p1 from its initial location l2_1 to l2_2. The cities involved are c1 and c2. Let's see what objects we have.

First, the initial state: p1 is in l2_1, which is in city c2. The goal is to have p1 in l2_2, which is also in c2. So both the start and end are in the same city, c2. That might mean we can do this with just a truck in c2. Let me check the available trucks. There's t2, which is a truck. Wait, looking back at the original state, the packages listed are p1, t1, t2, a1, a2. Wait, no, the original state says "Package t1 is in location l1_8", "Package t2 is in location l2_1", "Package p1 is in location l2_1", "Package a1 is in location l1_1", "Package a2 is in location l2_1". Wait, that can't be right. Wait, the objects listed include trucks t1 and t2, and airplanes a1 and a2. But in the original state, they mention "Package t1" and so on. That must be a mistake. Because t1 and t2 are trucks, not packages. Similarly, a1 and a2 are airplanes. So perhaps there's a typo in the original state description. Let me recheck.

The original state says:
"Package t1 is in location l1_8"
"Package t2 is in location l2_1"
"Package p1 is in location l2_1"
"Package a1 is in location l1_1"
"Package a2 is in location l2_1"

But according to the objects list, t1 and t2 are trucks, a1 and a2 are airplanes. So maybe those lines are incorrect. That's a problem. Wait, perhaps it's a misstatement. Maybe the correct original state should have trucks and airplanes in certain locations. For example, maybe "Truck t1 is in location l1_8" instead of "Package t1". Because otherwise, you can't load a truck into another truck. That doesn't make sense. So this must be a typo. The user probably meant to list the initial positions of trucks and airplanes as being in certain locations, not as packages. So I'll proceed under the assumption that the original state entries for t1, t2, a1, a2 are actually the locations of those trucks and airplanes, not packages. Otherwise, the problem is impossible because you can't move trucks as packages.

Assuming that:
- Truck t1 is in l1_8 (city c1)
- Truck t2 is in l2_1 (city c2)
- Airplane a1 is in l1_1 (airport in c1)
- Airplane a2 is in l2_1 (airport in c2)
- Package p1 is in l2_1 (c2's airport)

The goal is to get p1 to l2_2 in c2.

Since l2_1 and l2_2 are both in c2, and there's a truck t2 in l2_1. So the plan could be:

1. Load p1 into truck t2 at l2_1. But wait, can we? The preconditions for loadtruck are that both p and t are in the same location l. Since p1 is in l2_1 and t2 is in l2_1 (if the original state was a typo and t2 is a truck there), then yes. So loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1.

2. Then drive the truck from l2_1 to l2_2 in c2. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2.

3. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_2. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2.

That seems straightforward. But let's check the constraints. Are there any constraints mentioned? The user says the plan must abide by the following constraints, but the constraints section is empty. So no additional constraints beyond the usual action preconditions.

Wait, the problem statement says: "A valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints:" but then there's nothing listed. So maybe that's a formatting error. Assuming no extra constraints beyond the action preconditions.

So the steps would be:

1. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
2. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
3. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

That's three steps. Is there a shorter plan? Let's see. Since the truck is already in l2_1 where p1 is, just load, drive, unload. That's three actions, which is probably the minimal. So that's the optimal plan.
