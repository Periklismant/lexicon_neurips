Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. Hmm, the goal is to get package p1 to location l2_2. But there are a bunch of constraints that need to be satisfied along the way. Let me start by understanding the initial state and all the constraints.

First, the initial state: p1 is in l2_1, which is an airport in city c2. Also, a2 is in l2_1. Trucks t1 is in l1_8 (city c1), and t2 is... wait, the original state says "Package t1 is in location l1_8" and "Package t2 is in location l2_1". Wait, wait—wait, that's a mistake. Because t1 and t2 are trucks, not packages. The user might have made a typo here. Let me check again. The objects include "truck t1" and "truck t2", so the original state probably should state "Truck t1 is in location l1_8" and "Truck t2 is in location l2_1". Otherwise, if they are packages, that would conflict. I think that's a typo in the problem description. So I'll proceed under the assumption that t1 is a truck in l1_8 (city c1) and t2 is a truck in l2_1 (city c2). Similarly, airplanes a1 is in l1_1 (airport in c1), a2 is in l2_1 (airport in c2). 

Wait, looking at the original state:

"Package t1 is in location l1_8"
"Package t2 is in location l2_1"
"Package p1 is in location l2_1"
"Package a1 is in location l1_1"
"Package a2 is in location l2_1"

Wait, this is confusing. The objects include trucks t1, t2 and airplanes a1, a2, but the original state lists them as packages. That can't be right. This must be an error in the problem statement. Because in the objects list, they are correctly defined as trucks and airplanes. So the initial state entries for t1, t2, a1, a2 are probably typos. They should be trucks and airplanes, not packages. So I need to correct that mentally. So:

Original state corrected:

"Truck t1 is in location l1_8"
"Truck t2 is in location l2_1"
"Package p1 is in location l2_1"
"Airplane a1 is in location l1_1"
"Airplane a2 is in location l2_1"

Otherwise, if t1 and t2 are packages, then we can't use them as trucks. So this must be a mistake. I'll proceed with the corrected initial state.

Now, the goal is to have p1 in l2_2. l2_2 is in city c2. Since trucks can move within the same city, t2 is in l2_1 (the airport), so maybe we can drive t2 to l2_2. But first, p1 is already in l2_1. Wait, but the initial state says p1 is in l2_1. So why not just load p1 into t2 (which is in l2_1) and drive t2 to l2_2, then unload? But there are constraints that must be met. Let's look at the constraints.

Constraints:

1. "Package p1 is in t2" must hold in at least one state.
2. If p1 is in t2 at some state, then there must be an earlier state where p1 is in a2 or t1.
3. "p1 is in l1_8" at some state.
4. "p1 is in a2" at some state.
5. Either p1 is in l1_2 or l1_4 at some state.
6. p1 is in l2_7 at some state.
7. p1 is in l2_3 at some state.
8. Either p1 is in a1 or t1 at some state.
9. p1 is in l1_1 at some state.

So, the plan must include states where all these conditions are true. Therefore, the straightforward path of moving p1 via t2 in c2 won't work because we need to satisfy all these constraints. 

Let me outline the required steps while satisfying all constraints.

First, p1 starts in l2_1 (c2). The goal is l2_2 (c2). To get there via truck t2, we can load p1 into t2 at l2_1, drive to l2_2, and unload. But this path doesn't meet the constraints. For example, constraint 3 requires p1 to be in l1_8 (c1). So p1 needs to go to c1 first. But how? Since airplanes can move between airports. So maybe load p1 into a2 (which is in l2_1), fly a2 to l1_1 (c1's airport), unload p1 there, then use truck t1 (which is in l1_8) to transport it around. But that might complicate things.

Wait, let's list all the constraints and see the order in which they need to be satisfied.

Constraints that require p1 to be in certain places:

- l1_8 (c1)
- l1_2 or l1_4 (c1)
- l1_1 (c1)
- l2_7 (c2)
- l2_3 (c2)
- a2 (so p1 must be loaded into a2)
- in t2, but with the condition that before that, it was in a2 or t1.

Also, p1 must be in a1 or t1 at some point.

So, this suggests that p1's journey is quite complex. Let's try to map out a path that hits all these required locations.

Starting in l2_1 (c2). Let's get p1 into a2 first (satisfying constraint 4). Then fly a2 to l1_1 (c1's airport). Unload p1 into l1_1 (satisfies constraint 9). Then, load p1 into a1 (which is in l1_1) to satisfy part of constraint 8 (p1 in a1). Then fly a1 to some airport? Wait, but the goal is to get p1 to l2_2, which is in c2. Alternatively, after unloading p1 in l1_1, we can use truck t1 (which is in l1_8) to move it. But how?

Wait, t1 is in l1_8. So if we need p1 to be in l1_8 (constraint 3), maybe we can have p1 transported to l1_8 via some truck. But first, how does p1 get to c1? Let's see:

Initial steps:

1. Load p1 into a2 at l2_1 (since a2 is there). Action: loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1. Now p1 is in a2. This satisfies constraint 4.

2. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1. Action: flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1. Now a2 is in l1_1.

3. Unload p1 from a2 into l1_1. Action: unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1. Now p1 is in l1_1, satisfying constraint 9.

Now, to satisfy constraint 8 (p1 in a1 or t1). Let's load p1 into a1, which is in l1_1. So:

4. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1. Now p1 is in a1, satisfying part of constraint 8 (since "Package p1 is in a1" is true).

But then, perhaps we need to get p1 into t1 (which is in l1_8). To do that, we need to move p1 to l1_8. But t1 is a truck in l1_8. So to load p1 into t1, p1 must be in l1_8. So how to get p1 there?

Wait, currently p1 is in a1 at l1_1. To get it to l1_8, maybe unload it from a1 (but it's already unloaded?), wait no—after step 3, p1 is in l1_1. Then step 4 loads p1 into a1. So p1 is now in a1. Then, perhaps fly a1 to another airport? But l1_1 is the only airport in c1. So a1 can't fly within the same city. Wait, the flyairplane action allows flying from l_from to l_to, which can be any airports. Wait, but in the problem description, airplanes may move between airports. So airports can be in different cities. Wait, cities have their own airports. So l1_1 is in c1's airport, l2_1 in c2's. So to fly a1 from l1_1 (c1) to another airport, say l2_1 (c2). But that would take p1 back to c2, which might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps use trucks to move within c1.

Wait, after step 3, p1 is in l1_1 (c1). We can use a truck in c1 to move it. But t1 is in l1_8. So we need a truck in l1_1 to load p1 and drive it to l1_8. But the initial state has t1 in l1_8. So unless there's another truck in c1, which there isn't. Wait, objects include t1 (in c1) and t2 (in c2). So in c1, the only truck is t1, which is in l1_8. So to move p1 from l1_1 to l1_8, we need to get t1 to l1_1 first. So:

After step 3, p1 is in l1_1.

5. Drive t1 from l1_8 to l1_1. But wait, cities can have multiple locations. The drivetruck action allows moving between any locations in the same city. So l1_8 is in c1. l1_1 is in c1. So truck t1 can drive from l1_8 to l1_1 via drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_1 c1. Then, t1 is in l1_1.

6. Load p1 into t1 at l1_1: loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1. Now p1 is in t1. This satisfies part of constraint 8 (since p1 is in t1).

7. Drive t1 back to l1_8: drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_8 c1. Now t1 is in l1_8 with p1.

8. Unload p1 in l1_8: unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_8. Now p1 is in l1_8, satisfying constraint 3.

But now, we have to get p1 back to c2 to reach l2_2. Also, there are other constraints to meet: p1 needs to be in l1_2 or l1_4, l2_7, l2_3, etc. 

So after step 8, p1 is in l1_8. To get it to l1_2 or l1_4 (constraint 5), we need to move it via truck t1. Let's pick one of them, say l1_2.

9. Load p1 into t1 again at l1_8: loadtruck p1 t1 l1_8.

10. Drive t1 from l1_8 to l1_2: drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_2 c1. Now t1 is in l1_2.

11. Unload p1 in l1_2: unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2. Now p1 is in l1_2, satisfying constraint 5.

Now, to get p1 back to c2. Let's load it into a1 (which is in l1_1). So first, we need to move p1 to l1_1. Let's use t1 again.

12. Load p1 into t1 at l1_2: loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2.

13. Drive t1 to l1_1: drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1.

14. Unload p1 into l1_1: unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1. Now p1 is back in l1_1.

15. Load p1 into a1: loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1.

16. Fly a1 to l2_1: flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1. Now a1 is in l2_1 (c2's airport).

17. Unload p1 from a1 to l2_1: unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1. Now p1 is back in l2_1.

Now, we need to get p1 to l2_7 and l2_3 (constraints 6 and 7). Since t2 is in l2_1, we can use t2 to move p1 around.

18. Load p1 into t2 at l2_1: loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1. Now p1 is in t2. This satisfies constraint 1 (p1 in t2), but we need to check if the previous condition is met (earlier state where p1 is in a2 or t1). Earlier, p1 was in a2 (step 4) and in t1 (steps 6,9,12). So this is okay.

19. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_7: drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_7 c2. Now t2 is in l2_7.

20. Unload p1 in l2_7: unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_7. Now p1 is in l2_7 (satisfies constraint 6).

21. Load p1 back into t2: loadtruck p1 t2 l2_7.

22. Drive t2 to l2_3: drivetruck t2 l2_7 l2_3 c2.

23. Unload p1 in l2_3: unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (satisfies constraint7).

24. Load p1 into t2 again: loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3.

25. Drive t2 to l2_2: drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2.

26. Unload p1 in l2_2: unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2. This achieves the goal.

But this plan is quite long. Let me check if all constraints are met:

- p1 in t2 (step 18): yes.
- Before that, p1 was in a2 (step 4) and t1 (steps 6,9,12): yes.
- p1 in l1_8 (step 8): yes.
- p1 in a2 (step 4): yes.
- p1 in l1_2 (step 11): yes (satisfies constraint 5).
- p1 in l2_7 (step 20): yes.
- p1 in l2_3 (step23): yes.
- p1 in a1 (step15) and t1 (steps6,9,12): yes (constraint8).
- p1 in l1_1 (steps3,14): yes.

This seems to cover all constraints. But is there a shorter way? Let's see. For example, after step 8 (p1 in l1_8), maybe instead of moving to l1_2, we can go directly to l1_4 to satisfy constraint5, but maybe the steps are similar. Alternatively, after step14, when p1 is in l1_1, perhaps fly a1 to l2_1 and then proceed. But the steps involving l2_7 and l2_3 require moving via truck t2.

But maybe there's a more optimal path. Let's see if some steps can be combined or shortened.

For example, after step17, when p1 is back in l2_1, we can load it into t2 (step18), drive to l2_7, unload (step20), then drive to l2_3, then to l2_2. That would cover l2_7 and l2_3.

But each time, we need to unload to make the state where p1 is in those locations. So steps 18-26:

18. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
19. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_7 c2
20. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_7 (constraint6)
21. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_7
22. drivetruck t2 l2_7 l2_3 c2
23. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (constraint7)
24. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
25. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2
26. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (goal)

That's 9 steps just for this part. But maybe there's a way to combine some of these.

Alternatively, after step18, drive to l2_7, unload, then drive to l2_3, load, drive to l2_3, unload, etc. But each time, the package has to be in the location, so unloading is necessary.

Alternatively, after step18 (p1 in t2), drive to l2_7, unload (satisfy constraint6), load again, drive to l2_3, unload (satisfy constraint7), load again, drive to l2_2, unload. That's the same as above.

So this part can't be shortened, as we need to unload at l2_7 and l2_3 to satisfy the constraints.

Similarly, the earlier steps to meet the other constraints. So the total steps would be 26, which seems long. But the problem requires an optimal plan (shortest possible). Maybe there's a smarter way.

Wait, let's see. The constraints require certain states to exist, but not necessarily that they are part of the path. For example, maybe some of these can be achieved in different orders or combined. For example, when p1 is in l1_8 (constraint3), perhaps it can also be in t1, which is part of constraint8 (p1 in t1). So that step can cover both.

Similarly, when p1 is in a2 (step4), and then in a1 (step15), but perhaps there's a way to reduce steps.

Wait, let's try to find a more optimal path:

Initial state: p1 in l2_1 (c2).

Constraints:

Need to have p1 in a2 (step: load into a2), which is in l2_1.

1. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 → p1 in a2 (constraint4)
2. fly a2 to l1_1 → a2 in l1_1
3. unload p1 → p1 in l1_1 (constraint9)
4. load into a1 (in l1_1) → p1 in a1 (constraint8)
5. fly a1 to l2_1 → a1 in l2_1
6. unload p1 → p1 back in l2_1. But then we need to get to l1_8.

Wait, this doesn't help. Alternatively, after step3, p1 is in l1_1. Now, to get to l1_8, which requires moving via truck t1. But t1 is in l1_8. So:

5. drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_1 c1 → t1 in l1_1
6. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 → p1 in t1 (constraint8)
7. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_8 c1 → t1 back to l1_8 with p1
8. unload p1 in l1_8 → constraint3
Now, p1 is in l1_8. Need to get to l1_2 or l1_4.

9. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_8
10. drive to l1_2 → unload (constraint5)
11. load again, drive to l1_1, unload, load into a1, fly to l2_1, unload.

But this brings p1 back to l2_1, then need to handle l2_7 and l2_3.

This path still requires many steps. Perhaps there's a way to combine some steps.

Alternatively, after step8 (p1 in l1_8), instead of moving to l1_2, can we move to l1_4? Maybe, but steps are similar.

Another approach: perhaps use a different order of constraints. For example, after loading into a2 and flying to l1_1, unload p1 (l1_1). Then, instead of loading into a1, use truck t1 to move p1 to l1_2 or l1_4, then back to l1_8, etc.

Wait, let's try:

1. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 → constraint4
2. fly a2 to l1_1
3. unload p1 → constraint9
4. load into t1 (which is in l1_8. Wait, no: t1 is in l1_8 initially. So we need to bring t1 to l1_1 first.

So:

4. drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_1 c1 → t1 in l1_1
5. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 → constraint8 (p1 in t1)
6. drive t1 to l1_2 → drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
7. unload p1 → constraint5 (l1_2)
8. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
9. drive t1 to l1_8 → drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_8 c1
10. unload p1 → constraint3 (l1_8)
11. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_8
12. drive t1 to l1_1 → drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_1 c1
13. unload p1 in l1_1
14. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 → constraint8 (p1 in a1)
15. fly a1 to l2_1
16. unload p1 into l2_1
17. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 → constraint1 (p1 in t2), and since before this, p1 was in a2 (step1-3) and t1 (steps5,8,11), the condition is satisfied.
18. drive t2 to l2_7, unload (constraint6)
19. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_7
20. drive to l2_3, unload (constraint7)
21. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
22. drive to l2_2, unload (goal)

This path is still 22 steps. But maybe there's redundancy.

Wait, after step3, p1 is in l1_1. Step4 brings t1 to l1_1. Step5 loads into t1. Step6 drives to l1_2. Step7 unloads (constraint5). Then step8 loads back into t1, drives to l1_8 (step9), unload (step10). Then step11 loads again into t1, drives back to l1_1 (step12), unload (step13). Then load into a1 (step14), fly to l2_1 (step15), unload (step16). Then load into t2 (step17), drive to l2_7 (step18), unload (step19), etc.

This seems long, but perhaps necessary to meet all constraints.

Alternatively, can we avoid flying back to l2_1 multiple times? For example, after flying a2 to l1_1, unload p1, then use a1 to fly to l2_1 earlier. But not sure.

Alternatively, after step10 (p1 in l1_8), can we fly directly from l1_8? No, because airplanes can only fly from airports. l1_8 is a regular location, not an airport. So to get p1 back to an airport, we need to drive to l1_1 (the airport in c1).

So steps 11-13 are necessary.

Is there a way to combine steps to hit multiple constraints in one move? For example, when p1 is in l1_2 (constraint5), maybe also use that to get to l1_1 via truck, but I don't see how.

Another observation: The constraint requiring p1 to be in l2_7 and l2_3 can be handled in a single trip. For example, after loading into t2, drive to l2_7, unload (constraint6), then drive to l2_3, unload (constraint7), then to l2_2. So:

After step17 (p1 in t2):

18. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_7 c2
19. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_7 → constraint6
20. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_7
21. drivetruck t2 l2_7 l2_3 c2
22. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 → constraint7
23. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
24. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2
25. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 → goal

This is 8 steps for this part. So total steps would be:

1. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
2. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
3. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
4. drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_1 c1
5. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
6. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
7. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
8. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
9. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_8 c1
10. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_8
11. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_8
12. drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_1 c1
13. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
14. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
15. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
16. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
17. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
18. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_7 c2
19. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_7
20. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_7
21. drivetruck t2 l2_7 l2_3 c2
22. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
23. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
24. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2
25. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

That's 25 actions. But perhaps there's redundancy. For example, steps 4-13: moving t1 back and forth. Let's see if some steps can be eliminated.

After step10, p1 is unloaded in l1_8 (constraint3). Then step11 loads it back into t1. Then step12 drives to l1_1. Then step13 unloads in l1_1. Then step14 loads into a1. So steps 11-14 are necessary to get p1 into a1. 

But maybe instead of driving t1 back to l1_1, can we use a different approach. For example, after step10 (p1 in l1_8), load into t1 (step11), drive to l1_4 (step12), unload (step13) which would satisfy constraint5 (l1_4), then drive to l1_1 (step14), unload (step15), load into a1. That would cover constraint5 with l1_4 instead of l1_2. So:

Alternative steps after step10:

10. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_8 → constraint3
11. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_8
12. drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_4 c1
13. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4 → constraint5 (l1_4)
14. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
15. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
16. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
17. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 → constraint8
...

This way, steps 12-16 replace the previous steps 11-13. But the number of steps is the same. So this doesn't save any steps.

Another idea: after step7 (p1 unloaded in l1_2), instead of loading back into t1 and driving to l1_8, maybe fly from l1_1 (but p1 is in l1_2, which is not an airport). So no, can't fly from there. So the steps are necessary.

Alternatively, after step7, if we can drive t1 to another location that allows us to fly, but no, since only airports allow airplanes.

So this seems unavoidable.

Now, checking the constraints:

- constraint1: p1 in t2 (step17)
- constraint2: before that, p1 was in a2 (step1) and t1 (steps5,8, etc.)
- constraint3: p1 in l1_8 (step10)
- constraint4: p1 in a2 (step1)
- constraint5: p1 in l1_2 (step7) or l1_4 (if we choose that path)
- constraint6: p1 in l2_7 (step19)
- constraint7: p1 in l2_3 (step22)
- constraint8: p1 in a1 (step14) or t1 (steps5, etc.)
- constraint9: p1 in l1_1 (steps3,13, etc.)

All constraints are met.

But the plan has 25 actions. Is there a way to shorten it?

Let's see: After step3, p1 is in l1_1. To get it into a1 (step14), we need to load it there. But instead of driving t1 to l1_1, loading p1 into t1, then driving to l1_2, etc., perhaps there's a way to directly load p1 into a1 after step3. Because a1 is already in l1_1. So:

Step3: unload p1 into l1_1.

Step4: loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (now p1 is in a1, satisfying constraint8)

Step5: fly a1 to l2_1.

Step6: unload p1 into l2_1.

But this skips the need to get p1 into t1. However, this would miss the constraints that require p1 to be in t1 and in l1_8. So this approach would fail constraints3 and 5.

So we need to involve t1 to get p1 to l1_8 and l1_2/l1_4.

Another thought: After step3 (p1 in l1_1), instead of using t1, can we use a different truck? But there's no other truck in c1. Only t1 is available. So we have to use t1.

So the steps involving t1 are necessary.

Therefore, the plan length is indeed 25 actions, which might be the minimal required to satisfy all constraints.

But wait, perhaps some steps can be reordered. For example, after step3 (p1 in l1_1), load into a1 first (constraint8), then unload and proceed with t1. Let's see:

1. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 → constraint4
2. fly a2 to l1_1
3. unload p1 into l1_1 → constraint9
4. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 → constraint8 (p1 in a1)
5. fly a1 to l2_1
6. unload p1 into l2_1
7. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 → but this requires p1 to be in a2 or t1 before. But in this path, before step7, p1 was in a1 and a2. However, constraint2 says if p1 is in t2, there must be an earlier state where p1 is in a2 or t1. Here, p1 was in a2 (step1), so that's okay.

But this skips the need to have p1 in l1_8, l1_2/l1_4, l2_7, l2_3, etc. So this approach won't satisfy all constraints.

Therefore, the initial plan is necessary.

But I'm not sure if there's a shorter way. Given the number of constraints that require p1 to be in various locations across both cities, it's likely that the minimal plan is around 25 steps. However, perhaps I'm missing a smarter way to combine steps.

Alternative approach: Instead of moving p1 back to l2_1 via a1, perhaps use a2 again. For example:

After step3 (p1 in l1_1), load into a1 (step4), fly to l2_1 (step5), unload (step6). Then load into a2 (step7), fly back to l1_1 (step8), unload (step9). Then proceed with t1. But this adds steps and doesn't help with the constraints.

Alternatively, after getting p1 to l1_8 (constraint3), maybe fly a2 back to l2_1 with p1. But how? p1 is in l1_8, so we need to get it to an airport first. Which would require using t1 to drive to l1_1, load into a1 or a2.

But this seems to add steps.

At this point, I think the initial plan I outlined is necessary to meet all constraints. Therefore, I'll proceed to write the step-by-step plan as per the actions.
