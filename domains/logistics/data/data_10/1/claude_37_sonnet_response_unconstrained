Let me start by analyzing the problem:

1. We have cities c1 and c2.
2. Each city has multiple locations: l1_1 to l1_10 for c1, and l2_1 to l2_10 for c2.
3. We have two trucks (t1 and t2), two airplanes (a1 and a2), and one package (p1).
4. The goal is to get package p1 to location l2_2.

Let's start by clarifying the initial state:

- p1 is in location l2_1
- t1 is in location l1_8
- t2 is in location l2_1
- a1 is in location l1_1
- a2 is in location l2_1

And it seems like l1_1 and l2_1 are airports.

The goal is to get p1 from l2_1 to l2_2.

Since p1 and l2_2 are both in city c2, and p1 is already in city c2 (at location l2_1), we can use a truck (t2) to transport p1 from l2_1 to l2_2. We don't need to use the airplanes in this case.

Here's the plan:

1. Load p1 into t2 at location l2_1: "loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1"
2. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2 in city c2: "drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2"
3. Unload p1 from t2 at location l2_2: "unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2"

Let's check if this plan is optimal and valid by going through the actions and their preconditions:

1. "loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1":
   - Preconditions: p1 and t2 are both in location l2_1. This is satisfied by the initial state.
   - Effects: p1 is no longer in l2_1, and p1 is in t2.

2. "drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2":
   - Preconditions: t2 is in l2_1, and both l2_1 and l2_2 are in city c2. This is satisfied after the first action.
   - Effects: t2 is no longer in l2_1, and t2 is in l2_2.

3. "unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2":
   - Preconditions: t2 is in l2_2, and p1 is in t2. This is satisfied after the second action.
   - Effects: p1 is no longer in t2, and p1 is in l2_2.

After these three actions, p1 is in l2_2, which satisfies the goal. This is the shortest valid plan for the given problem.

Wait, actually, let me double-check something. In the initial state description, it says:

"Package t1 is in location l1_8"
"Package t2 is in location l2_1"
"Package p1 is in location l2_1"
"Package a1 is in location l1_1"
"Package a2 is in location l2_1"

It refers to trucks (t1, t2) and airplanes (a1, a2) as "packages". This seems a bit confusing. Let me re-interpret this:

- Truck t1 is in location l1_8
- Truck t2 is in location l2_1
- Package p1 is in location l2_1
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

With this interpretation, the plan I provided is still valid:

1. "loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1"
2. "drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2"
3. "unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2"

This plan moves package p1 from l2_1 to l2_2 using truck t2, which is the most direct way given the initial state.

Hmm, though there's a discrepancy: l1_1 and l2_1 are supposed to be airports, but I don't see this explicitly stated in the initial conditions. Let me check the list of objects again:

"airport l1_1"
"airport l2_1"

Ok, I see. In the objects section, l1_1 and l2_1 are labeled as airports. So, the interpretation I provided is correct.

Given that package p1 is already in the same city as the goal location, using a truck to move it is the most efficient approach. We don't need to use airplanes in this case.

So, the optimal plan is:

```
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
```

Actually, I notice I made an error. In the objects section, there's no clear distinction between trucks, airplanes, and packages as being "located" in specific locations. I've been interpreting the "Package X is in location Y" statements as meaning that object X (be it a package, truck, or airplane) is in location Y.

Let me re-interpret the initial state:

"Package t1 is in location l1_8": This is confusing. t1 is a truck, not a package. Perhaps it should read "Truck t1 is in location l1_8".
"Package t2 is in location l2_1": Similarly, t2 is a truck. Perhaps it should read "Truck t2 is in location l2_1".
"Package p1 is in location l2_1": This is clear. p1 is a package in location l2_1.
"Package a1 is in location l1_1": a1 is an airplane, not a package. Perhaps it should read "Airplane a1 is in location l1_1".
"Package a2 is in location l2_1": Similar confusion. a2 is an airplane, not a package. Perhaps it should read "Airplane a2 is in location l2_1".

Given this re-interpretation, I think the initial state is:

- Truck t1 is in location l1_8
- Truck t2 is in location l2_1
- Package p1 is in location l2_1
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

With this understanding, the plan I provided earlier is valid.

Let me do one more sanity check:

In the initial state, p1 is in l2_1, and we want to move it to l2_2. Both l2_1 and l2_2 are in city c2. Truck t2 is already in l2_1, so it can pick up p1. We can:

1. Load p1 into t2 at l2_1: "loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1"
2. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2 in city c2: "drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2"
3. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_2: "unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2"

This plan is valid and optimal for the given problem.

Hmm, actually, in the description of the loadairplane and unloadairplane actions, I notice a discrepancy:

"loadairplane p ap l": Load package p in airplane ap. Both p and ap are in location l.
"loadairplane p ap l": Unload package p from airplane ap in location l.

They both use the same action name. I think the second one should be "unloadairplane". Let me check other parts of the problem description...

Yes, in the preconditions and effects sections, the action is referred to as "unloadairplane". So, I'll consider the second instance of "loadairplane" as a typo, and it should be "unloadairplane".

With that cleared up, my plan remains:

```
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
```

This is the optimal plan for the given problem.

One more thing to double-check: Are l1_1 and l2_1 the only airports?

In the objects section, it says:
"airport l1_1"
"airport l2_1"

So, l1_1 and l2_1 are the only two airports in the problem.

Since p1 is already in city c2 and the goal is also in city c2, there's no need to use airplanes. The truck t2, which is already in the same location as p1, can directly transport p1 to the goal location.

My final answer is:

```
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
```

Hmm, I realize I'm still a bit confused about the initial state. Let me try to interpret it more precisely, with the correct labels for the objects:

"Location l1_1 is in city c1" to "Location l2_10 is in city c2": These statements are clear. They define the cities that each location belongs to.

"Package t1 is in location l1_8": This seems like a mislabeling. t1 is defined as a truck in the objects section. I think this should be interpreted as "Truck t1 is in location l1_8".

"Package t2 is in location l2_1": Similarly, t2 is a truck, not a package. This should be "Truck t2 is in location l2_1".

"Package p1 is in location l2_1": This is clear. p1 is a package in location l2_1.

"Package a1 is in location l1_1": a1 is defined as an airplane in the objects section. This should be "Airplane a1 is in location l1_1".

"Package a2 is in location l2_1": Similar to a1, a2 is an airplane. This should be "Airplane a2 is in location l2_1".

Given these interpretations, the plan I provided is valid. We're using t2 to transport p1 from l2_1 to l2_2, which is the most direct way given the initial state.

```
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
```
