```
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
```
``` 

The package p1 starts at l2_1 (an airport in c2). Since the goal is to move it to l2_2 in the same city, we use truck t2 which is already located at l2_1. We load p1 into t2, drive it to l2_2, then unload. This plan uses the minimal 3 actions required to achieve the goal without unnecessary steps.
