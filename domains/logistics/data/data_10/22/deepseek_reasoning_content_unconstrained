Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this planning problem. So, the goal is to get package p1 to l1_5 and p2 to l1_4. Let's start by understanding the initial state.

First, looking at the initial positions. The objects are spread across cities c1 and c2. 

For p1: It's in l2_5, which is in city c2. So p1 is in c2. To get it to l1_5 in c1, we probably need to move it between cities. Since airplanes can move between airports, and trucks can move within a city.

For p2: It's in l2_3, which is in c2. We need to get it to l1_4 in c1. So similar to p1, this might require moving between cities via airplanes.

Wait, but the airports are l1_1 in c1 and l2_1 in c2. So airplanes can fly between these airports. So the plan might involve loading p1 and p2 onto airplanes in c2, flying them to c1's airport, then using trucks to move them to their destinations.

But let's check the initial positions of the trucks and airplanes. The original state says:

"Package t1 is in location l1_4" — Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, maybe there's a typo. Let me check again. The original state lists:

Wait, the user wrote "Package t1 is in location l1_4" but t1 is a truck. Oh, that's a mistake. Because in the objects, t1 is a truck. So the user probably meant "Truck t1 is in location l1_4". Similarly, "Package t2 is in location l2_3" — but t2 is a truck, so that should be "Truck t2 is in location l2_3". Similarly for a1 and a2: "Package a1 is in location l1_1" but a1 is an airplane. So maybe the original state has some typos. Wait, this is crucial. Let me re-examine the original state:

Original state:

"Package t1 is in location l1_4"
"Package t2 is in location l2_3"
"Package p1 is in location l2_5"
"Package p2 is in location l2_3"
"Package a1 is in location l1_1"
"Package a2 is in location l2_1"

Wait, this can't be right. Because t1 is a truck, not a package. Similarly, a1 and a2 are airplanes. So this must be a mistake in the problem description. Maybe the user intended to say "Truck t1 is in l1_4", "Airplane a1 is in l1_1", etc. Otherwise, the problem is impossible because trucks and airplanes are packages, which they are not. So I need to assume that the original state has a typo, and that "Package t1" should be "Truck t1", and similarly for the others. Otherwise, the problem is unsolvable because the initial positions of the trucks and airplanes are not given. So I'll proceed under that assumption.

So corrected initial state for vehicles:

- Truck t1 is at l1_4 (city c1)
- Truck t2 is at l2_3 (city c2)
- Airplane a1 is at l1_1 (c1's airport)
- Airplane a2 is at l2_1 (c2's airport)

Packages:

- p1 is at l2_5 (c2)
- p2 is at l2_3 (c2)

So to get p1 to l1_5 (c1), we need to move it from l2_5 (c2) to l1_5 (c1). Let's think about the steps:

For p1: l2_5 is in c2. To get to c1, need to use an airplane. But first, get p1 to an airport in c2 (l2_1). So maybe use truck t2 to transport p1 from l2_5 to l2_1. Then load onto airplane a2, fly to l1_1, unload, then use truck t1 (which is in l1_4) to drive to l1_1, load p1, then drive to l1_5. Wait, but t1 is in l1_4. So maybe t1 needs to drive to l1_1 to pick up p1 after it's unloaded from the airplane.

Wait, but let's outline the steps for p1:

1. Move p1 from l2_5 to l2_1 (airport in c2). Since l2_5 is in c2, we can use truck t2. But where is t2 initially? If t2 is in l2_3, which is in c2, then we can drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_5, load p1, then drive to l2_1.

Wait, initial positions:

- t2 is in l2_3. So drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_5 (same city c2), load p1 into t2. Then drive t2 to l2_1 (airport in c2). Then unload p1 at l2_1. Then load it onto airplane a2 (since a2 is in l2_1). Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1. Then, in c1, use truck t1 (which is in l1_4) to drive to l1_1, load p1, then drive to l1_5 and unload.

Similarly for p2: It's in l2_3. We need to get it to l1_4. So perhaps:

For p2: It's already in l2_3 where t2 is. So load p2 into t2, drive t2 to l2_1, unload, load onto a2, fly to l1_1. Then in c1, use truck t1 (which is in l1_4) to drive to l1_1, load p2, drive back to l1_4, unload.

But wait, t1 is in l1_4 initially. So to get to l1_1 (airport), need to drive from l1_4 to l1_1. But can trucks move between any locations in their city? Yes, because drivetruck allows moving between any locations in the same city.

So the steps for p1 and p2 can be interleaved or done in parallel, but since we need an optimal (shortest) plan, perhaps combining steps where possible.

Wait, but the problem says "a valid sequence of actions", so it's a linear plan, not parallel. So need to find the minimal number of steps.

Let me outline possible steps:

For p1:

1. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_5 (c2)
2. Load p1 into t2 at l2_5
3. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (c2's airport)
4. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1
5. Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1
6. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1
7. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1
8. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1 (c1)
9. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_1
10. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_5 (c1)
11. Unload p1 at l1_5

For p2:

Since p2 is in l2_3 (same as t2's initial location), so:

1. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_3
2. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1 (same steps as p1's steps 3)
3. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1
4. Load p2 onto a2 at l2_1
5. Fly a2 (same flight as p1's step 6)
6. Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1
7. Drive t1 (after it's back to l1_1? Wait, but t1 was driven to l1_1 in step 8 for p1, then to l1_5. Wait, no. Wait, after step 10, t1 is in l1_5. So after unloading p1 in step 11, t1 is in l1_5. Then to move p2, we need to get t1 back to l1_1?

Wait, this seems complicated. Let's see. Let's try to see if we can combine the steps for p1 and p2.

Because both packages need to be moved from c2 to c1. So perhaps:

- Load both p1 and p2 into t2, drive to l2_1, then onto a2, fly to l1_1. Then use t1 to move both to their destinations.

But let's outline the steps:

First, for t2 in l2_3:

1. Load p2 into t2 at l2_3 (since p2 is there)
2. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_5 (to pick up p1)
3. Load p1 into t2 at l2_5
4. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (airport)
5. Unload p1 and p2 from t2 at l2_1
6. Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1
7. Load p2 onto a2 at l2_1
8. Fly a2 to l1_1
9. Unload p1 and p2 from a2 at l1_1
10. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1 (c1)
11. Load p1 into t1
12. Drive t1 to l1_5 and unload p1
13. Load p2 into t1 (but wait, after step 11, t1 is in l1_1. After step 12, t1 is in l1_5. So to load p2, we need t1 to be back in l1_1. Hmm, this is a problem. So after step 12, t1 is in l1_5. To move p2 from l1_1 to l1_4, we need to drive t1 back to l1_1, load p2, then drive to l1_4. But that's two more steps. Alternatively, maybe after step 10, when t1 is at l1_1, load both p1 and p2 into t1, then drive to l1_5 to drop p1, then drive to l1_4 to drop p2. But can a truck carry multiple packages? The problem doesn't say that trucks can only carry one package. So maybe possible.

But the problem's action definitions allow loading and unloading individual packages. So in that case, after step 9, both p1 and p2 are at l1_1. Then t1 is driven to l1_1 (step 10). Then load p1 into t1 (step 11), drive to l1_5 (step 12), unload (step13). Then drive t1 back to l1_1 (step14), load p2 (step15), drive to l1_4 (step16), unload (step17). That's a lot of steps. But maybe there's a better way.

Alternatively, after step 9, when both p1 and p2 are at l1_1, and t1 is driven to l1_1 (step10), we can load both packages into t1. But each load action is per package. So steps would be:

10. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1 (c1)
11. Load p1 into t1 at l1_1
12. Load p2 into t1 at l1_1
13. Drive t1 to l1_5 (unload p1)
14. Unload p1 at l1_5
15. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_4 (unload p2)
16. Unload p2 at l1_4

But the drive from l1_5 to l1_4 is possible since they are in the same city. So steps 13-16 would be:

13. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_5
14. Unload p1 at l1_5
15. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_4
16. Unload p2 at l1_4

So that's four steps (13-16). But in this approach, we can carry both packages in the same truck and make two stops. This would save steps compared to separate trips.

So combining, the steps for both packages would be:

For moving both packages from c2 to c1:

1. Load p2 into t2 at l2_3
2. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_5
3. Load p1 into t2 at l2_5
4. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1
5. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1
6. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1
7. Load p1 onto a2 at l2_1
8. Load p2 onto a2 at l2_1
9. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1
10. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1
11. Unload p2 from a2 at l1_1
12. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1
13. Load p1 into t1 at l1_1
14. Load p2 into t1 at l1_1
15. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_5
16. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_5
17. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_4
18. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_4

That's 18 steps. But maybe some steps can be optimized.

Wait, but when flying the airplane, steps 7 and 8 can be done in any order, but each is a separate action. Similarly, unloading both packages after the flight (steps 10 and 11). But perhaps steps 5 and 6 can be combined into a single unload action? No, because each unload is per package. So we need two separate unload steps. Same for loading.

Alternatively, maybe after driving t2 to l2_1, we can unload both packages in one step? No, each unload is per package, so two steps.

Similarly, when loading onto the airplane, two steps. Then flying once. Then unloading two steps.

Now, in step 15-18: driving t1 to l1_5, unload p1, then drive to l1_4, unload p2. That's four steps. But perhaps there's a way to unload p2 first, then p1. Wait, but the order doesn't matter as long as the final positions are correct.

But maybe there's a better way. For example, after loading both packages into t1, drive to l1_4 first (unload p2), then drive to l1_5 (unload p1). But since l1_4 is the original location of t1, maybe that's shorter.

Wait, after step 12: t1 is driven from l1_4 to l1_1. Then steps 13 and 14 load both packages. Then, drive to l1_4 first (step15: drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_4, unload p2 (step16), then drive to l1_5 (step17), unload p1 (step18). That's four steps as well. The number of steps is the same. So no gain.

But wait, maybe after loading both packages into t1 at l1_1, drive to l1_4 (since that's the destination for p2), unload p2, then drive to l1_5 to unload p1. That would be:

15. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_4
16. Unload p2 at l1_4
17. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_5
18. Unload p1 at l1_5

That's four steps again. Same length. So the order doesn't affect the number of steps. So either way.

But perhaps there's a way to reduce steps by combining some actions. Let's see.

Wait, when driving t2 from l2_3 to l2_5, then to l2_1: that's two drive actions. But maybe can we combine those? No, because each drive action is between two locations. So moving from l2_3 to l2_5 is one drive, then l2_5 to l2_1 is another.

Similarly, for t1's movement: l1_4 to l1_1, then to l1_5, then to l1_4 again? That's three drive actions for t1. But maybe not.

Wait, but let's think again. Let me try to count all steps:

For p1 and p2:

In c2:

1. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
2. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2
3. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
4. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
5. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
6. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
7. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
8. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
9. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
10. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
11. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
In c1:

12. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
13. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
14. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
15. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
16. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
17. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1
18. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

That's 18 steps.

But maybe there's a way to optimize. For example, when flying the airplane, perhaps we can fly a2 to l1_1 once, which is correct. So that's okay.

But perhaps when loading both packages into a2, but maybe the order of loading doesn't matter.

Alternatively, maybe after flying, when unloading both packages, but again, two steps.

Is there a way to reduce the number of steps?

Wait, perhaps after unloading the airplane, use two different trucks. But in c1, there's only t1. So t1 has to handle both packages.

Alternatively, maybe after flying, use the airplane to fly directly to a different airport. Wait, but the destination for p1 is l1_5 (not an airport), so you need a truck.

Alternatively, maybe use another airplane. But in the initial state, a1 is in l1_1 (c1's airport). So a1 is in c1. But p1 and p2 are in c2. So unless a1 can fly to c2, but that would require fuel, but the problem doesn't mention fuel constraints. But the problem says airplanes can fly between any airports. So if a1 is in l1_1, it could fly to l2_1. But maybe that's unnecessary. Let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps use a1 to help. But since a1 is in l1_1, to get it to c2, fly a1 to l2_1, load packages, fly back. But that would add steps. Probably not optimal.

Alternatively, maybe use a2 to carry both packages in one flight. Which is what we did.

So the steps seem necessary.

But wait, the initial state says "Package a1 is in location l1_1" — but a1 is an airplane. So again, that's a typo; it should be "Airplane a1 is in l1_1". Similarly for a2. So we can use a2 to fly from l2_1 to l1_1.

Now, let's check if there's a shorter way. For example, can we avoid driving t1 to l1_1 and back, by having t1 already at l1_1? No, because t1 starts at l1_4.

Alternatively, can we use another truck? But in c1, there's only t1. So no.

So perhaps the 18-step plan is the minimal.

But wait, maybe some steps can be reordered to save actions. Let's see.

For example, after flying a2 to l1_1, unload p1 and p2. Then, instead of driving t1 to l1_1, can we have t1 already moving to l1_1 while other actions are happening? No, because actions are sequential.

Alternatively, perhaps combine some steps.

Wait, step 5 and 6 are unloading both packages from t2 at l2_1. Could we unload them in a different order? Doesn't matter. Then steps 7 and 8 load them onto a2. Then steps 9-11 fly and unload.

Now, in c1, after unloading, we need to move them to their destinations using t1. So steps 12-18.

Is there a way to reduce the number of steps here?

For example, after loading both packages into t1, drive to l1_5, unload p1, then drive to l1_4 and unload p2. But that's two drives and two unloads. Alternatively, drive to l1_4 first, unload p2, then drive to l1_5 and unload p1. Either way, same number of steps.

But maybe there's a way to have t1 already at l1_1 when the packages arrive. But since t1 starts at l1_4, we need to drive it to l1_1 (step12).

Another thought: when t2 is driving from l2_5 to l2_1, could it make multiple stops? No, each drive action is between two locations. So l2_5 to l2_1 is one drive action.

Alternatively, can we load both packages into the truck in one step? No, each load is per package.

So I think the 18-step plan is the minimal possible.

But wait, let's check for possible overlaps. For example, when loading both packages onto a2, maybe after loading one, fly and then load the other. But no, because the airplane has to be at the same location to load both. So they need to be loaded before flying.

Alternatively, fly the airplane twice. But that would take more steps.

Hmm. Alternatively, use two different airplanes, but a2 is the only one in c2. a1 is in c1. So not helpful.

Another angle: can we use a different truck in c2? There's t2 in c2. But t2 is in c2 and can't move to c1. So after delivering the packages to the airport in c2, t2's job is done.

So I think the 18-step plan is required. But wait, maybe I'm missing a smarter way.

Wait, let's think again. For p2: it's in l2_3 initially. t2 is also in l2_3. So first action is loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3. Then drive t2 to l2_5 (to get p1). Load p1, drive to l2_1. Then unload both. Load both onto a2, fly to l1_1, unload. Then use t1 to take them to their destinations.

But what if we handle p1 and p2 separately? Let's see.

For p1:

1. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_5 (c2)
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
3. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
5. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
6. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
7. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
8. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
9. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
10. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
11. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5

That's 11 steps for p1.

For p2:

12. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
13. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2 (since t2 is already at l2_3 after step 1, but after step 3, t2 is at l2_1. Wait, no. After step 3, t2 is at l2_1. So after handling p1, t2 is at l2_1. Then to handle p2, we need to drive t2 back to l2_3 to load p2? Wait, no. p2 is already at l2_3. Wait, initial state: p2 is at l2_3. But after step 1, when we drive t2 to l2_5, t2 leaves l2_3. So p2 is still at l2_3. Then, after step 3, t2 is at l2_1. So to load p2, we need to drive t2 back to l2_3. But that would add more steps. So this approach would be longer. Hence, combining the steps for both packages into one sequence is better.

Therefore, the original 18-step plan seems necessary.

But wait, maybe there's a way to load p2 onto t2 at l2_3, then drive t2 to l2_1 directly, without going to l2_5. But then how do we pick up p1, which is at l2_5?

Alternatively, maybe use two trips: first handle p2, then p1. But that would require more steps.

For example:

Handle p2 first:

1. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
2. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
3. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
4. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
5. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
6. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
7. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
8. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
9. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
10. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

Then handle p1:

11. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2 (but after step 2, t2 is at l2_1)
12. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
13. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
14. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
15. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
16. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
17. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
18. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 (but t1 is at l1_4 after step 10)
19. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
20. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
21. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5

This approach would take 21 steps, which is longer than the combined approach. So the combined approach is better.

So the initial plan of 18 steps seems optimal.

But wait, perhaps there's a way to have the airplane fly twice? For example, first fly p2 to l1_1, then fly back to get p1. But that would require more steps.

Alternatively, after moving p1 and p2 to l2_1, fly them together in one flight. Which is better.

So the 18-step plan is better.

But let me check again if any steps can be merged or eliminated.

For example, steps 5 and 6 are unloading both packages from t2. Then steps 7 and 8 are loading onto a2. Then step 9 is flying. Then steps 10 and 11 are unloading from a2.

But perhaps steps 5 and 6 can be done in any order, and similarly for 7 and 8. But they are separate steps.

Another thought: After loading both packages into t2, and driving to l2_1, then unloading and loading into a2, fly to l1_1, unload, then use t1 to move both. That's correct.

But is there a way to have t1 move to l1_1 before the airplane arrives? For example, can we drive t1 to l1_1 while the airplane is in flight? Yes, but since actions are sequential, the drive would have to happen before or after the flight. Let's see:

If we drive t1 to l1_1 (step12) after the airplane has flown (step9), but before unloading (steps10-11). So:

9. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
12. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
10. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
11. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

But no, because until the airplane has arrived at l1_1, the packages are not there. So t1 can be driven to l1_1 in preparation. So the order could be:

9. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
12. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
10. unload p1
11. unload p2

Which is possible. So the steps can be reordered as:

After step9 (fly), then step12 (drive t1), then steps10-11 (unload). That way, t1 is already at l1_1 when the packages are unloaded.

This doesn't reduce the number of steps, but just reorders them. So the total steps remain the same.

Alternatively, perhaps driving t1 to l1_1 earlier. For example, after step8 (load p2 onto a2), before flying. But that's possible. For example:

Steps:

1-8: load both packages into a2
12. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 (before flying)
9. fly a2 to l1_1
10. unload p1
11. unload p2

Then steps13-18 as before.

This way, t1 is already at l1_1 when the packages arrive. So the steps would be:

1-8 as before
9. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
10. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
11. unload p1
12. unload p2
13. load p1 into t1
14. load p2 into t1
15. drive to l1_5, unload p1
16. drive to l1_4, unload p2

That's still 16 steps? Let's recount:

Original steps:

1. load p2 into t2
2. drive t2 to l2_5
3. load p1 into t2
4. drive t2 to l2_1
5. unload p2
6. unload p1
7. load p1 into a2
8. load p2 into a2
9. drive t1 to l1_1
10. fly a2 to l1_1
11. unload p1 from a2
12. unload p2 from a2
13. load p1 into t1
14. load p2 into t1
15. drive to l1_5
16. unload p1
17. drive to l1_4
18. unload p2

Wait, no, step9 is now before the flight. So the total steps are:

1. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
2. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2
3. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
4. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
5. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
6. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
7. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
8. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
9. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1

Still 18 steps. So reordering steps 9 and 10 doesn't change the count.

Thus, no gain. So the minimal plan is 18 steps.

But wait, maybe when the airplane flies, the packages are in it, so when it arrives at l1_1, the packages are there. Then, instead of unloading them, can we directly load them into the truck? No, because the truck is at l1_1. But to load into the truck, the packages must be at the same location as the truck. So we need to unload them from the airplane first.

Thus, steps 11 and 12 are necessary.

So I think the 18-step plan is indeed the minimal possible.
