Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. First, I need to understand the initial state and the goal. The goal is to have package p1 in location l2_1 and package p2 in l2_3. The initial state has p1 in l2_5 (which is in city c2) and p2 in l1_5 (city c1). 

Looking at the constraints, there are quite a few. Let's list them out and see how they affect the plan. The constraints require certain conditions to be true at some point, and some implications between states. For example, p1 must be in l2_5 at some state, but if it is, then p1 must be in l1_3 either at that state or later. Also, p2 must be in l1_4 at some point, and in l2_3. Then there's a conditional that when p2 is in l2_3, there must be an earlier state where p1 is in l1_5 or l1_4. Another constraint is that p2 must be in a2 or l2_5 at some state. Also, p1 must be in t1, a1, and p2 in a2, etc.

Wait, the initial state says "Package t1 is in location l1_3". Wait, t1 is a truck, right? The objects include "truck t1" and "truck t2". So the initial state mentions where the trucks and airplanes are. Let me recheck:

Original state:
- Package t1 is in l1_3. Wait, t1 is a truck, so maybe that's a typo. Probably, it should be "Truck t1 is in location l1_3". Similarly, "Package t2 is in l2_5" might be a typo for Truck t2. Same with "Package a1" and "Package a2" which should be airplanes. This seems like a mistake in the problem description. But I have to go with what's given. Wait, the objects are listed as "truck t1", "truck t2", "airplane a1", "airplane a2". So in the initial state, the entries like "Package t1 is in l1_3" must be errors. Probably, they meant "Truck t1 is in l1_3", "Truck t2 is in l2_5", "Airplane a1 is in l1_1", "Airplane a2 is in l2_1". Otherwise, the problem doesn't make sense because packages can't be trucks or airplanes. So assuming that's a typo, I'll proceed under the corrected initial state:

Truck t1 is in l1_3 (city c1)
Truck t2 is in l2_5 (city c2)
Airplane a1 is in l1_1 (airport in c1)
Airplane a2 is in l2_1 (airport in c2)
Package p1 is in l2_5 (city c2)
Package p2 is in l1_5 (city c1)

So, the goal is to get p1 to l2_1 (which is an airport in c2) and p2 to l2_3 (city c2).

Now, considering the movement options. To move between cities, we need airplanes. Since p1 is in c2's l2_5, but the goal is l2_1 (same city), but wait, l2_1 is in c2, so maybe we can use a truck. Wait, l2_5 is in c2. So for p1 to get from l2_5 to l2_1 (airport in c2), maybe truck t2 can drive there. But t2 is in l2_5. So drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1. Wait, but l2_5 is in c2, and l2_1 is also in c2. So the truck can drive between locations in the same city. So for p1 in l2_5, we can load it into t2 (since t2 is there), drive t2 to l2_1, then unload. But wait, the goal is for p1 to be in l2_1. However, the constraints require that p1 must be in l2_5 at some state. But initially, it's already there. So that's covered. Then, the constraint says that if p1 is in l2_5 in some state, then p1 must be in l1_3 in that state or later. Wait, but if p1 is moved from l2_5 (c2) to l2_1 (c2), how would it get to l1_3 (c1)? That seems conflicting. So perhaps we need to first move p1 from l2_5 to c1, then back to c2. But why? Because the constraint says that after p1 is in l2_5 (which it is initially), it must be in l1_3 at some point after. But the initial state already has p1 in l2_5. So the first occurrence is the initial state. Therefore, we must have p1 in l1_3 at some state after that. So, p1 needs to be moved from l2_5 to l1_3. But how?

Wait, but p1 starts in l2_5 (c2). To get to l1_3 (c1), we need to transport it via airplane. Let's see. From l2_5, we can load p1 into truck t2 (which is in l2_5), drive t2 to l2_1 (airport), unload p1, load into airplane a2 (which is in l2_1), fly a2 to l1_1 (airport of c1), unload p1, load into truck t1 (in l1_3? Wait, t1 is in l1_3. Wait, l1_1 is the airport of c1. So after flying a2 to l1_1, we can unload p1 there. Then, to get to l1_3, we need a truck in l1_1. But t1 is in l1_3. So maybe we need to drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1, load p1, drive back to l1_3, unload. Then, maybe fly back to c2. But this seems complicated. But perhaps this is necessary to satisfy the constraint that after p1 is in l2_5 (initial state), it must be in l1_3 at some state after.

But then, after that, we need to get p1 back to l2_1 (the goal). So perhaps after moving p1 to l1_3, we need to move it again to l1_1 (airport), load into a1, fly to l2_1, unload. That would get p1 to l2_1. So this path would satisfy the constraints.

But let's check all constraints:

Constraints:
1. p1 in l2_5 at least once: already true initially.
2. If p1 in l2_5 (which is the case in initial state), then p1 must be in l1_3 at s or after. So we need to get p1 to l1_3.
3. p2 must be in l1_4 at least once.
4. p2 must be in l2_3 (goal).
5. If p2 is in l2_3, then in an earlier state, p1 is in l1_5 or l1_4.
6. p2 must be in a2 or l2_5 at some state. Initially, p2 is in l1_5. So we need to get p2 to either a2 or l2_5. But l2_5 is in c2. So moving p2 from c1 to c2 would require airplane. Let's think.
7. p1 must be in l1_5 at some state. But p1 starts in l2_5. So need to move p1 to l1_5. Wait, but that's in c1. So that would require moving p1 from c2 to c1.
8. p2 must be in l2_1 at some state. And when that happens, there must be an earlier state where p2 is in l2_2 or p1 is in l2_4. So getting p2 to l2_1 would need to ensure that either p2 was in l2_2 before or p1 was in l2_4.
9. p2 must be in a2. So we need to load p2 into a2 at some point.
10. p1 must be in t1. So load into truck t1 at some point.
11. p1 must be in a1. So load into airplane a1.
12. p2 must be in l1_1. So need to get p2 to l1_1 (airport of c1).
13. If p2 is in l1_1, then before that, p2 was in l2_1 or p1 in l1_4.

This is a lot to handle. Let's try to outline the steps for each package.

Starting with p1:

Initial location: l2_5 (c2). Goal: l2_1 (c2). But constraints require p1 to be in l1_3. So steps for p1:

1. Move p1 from l2_5 to l2_1 via truck t2 (since t2 is in l2_5). But wait, but this would take p1 to l2_1 directly, which is the goal. But then we'd need to also get p1 to l1_3. So maybe:

- Load p1 into t2 in l2_5.
- Drive t2 to l2_1 (airport).
- Unload p1 in l2_1.
- Then, load p1 into a2 (since a2 is in l2_1).
- Fly a2 to l1_1 (c1's airport).
- Unload p1 into l1_1.
- Load p1 into truck t1 (drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1, load, then drive back to l1_3).
Wait, t1 is initially in l1_3. So drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1 (possible as they are in c1). Then load p1 into t1 at l1_1. Then drive t1 back to l1_3 and unload. That would put p1 in l1_3. Then, to get p1 back to l2_1, load into a1 (which is in l1_1) and fly to l2_1. But a1 is in l1_1. Fly to l2_1 (c2's airport), unload p1. That would achieve the goal.

But this involves a lot of steps. Let's outline:

For p1:

- loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
- drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
- unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
- loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
- flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
- unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
- drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
- loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
- drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
- unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
- loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (Wait, a1 is in l1_1. Wait, after unloading p1 from a2 in l1_1, then to load into a1, but maybe we need to fly a1 somewhere else first? No, a1 is already in l1_1. So after unloading p1 in l1_1, then load into a1, fly to l2_1, unload.

Wait, but after unloading p1 in l1_1 (from a2), then we can load it into a1 and fly to l2_1.

Wait, steps would be:

After unloading p1 in l1_1:

- loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
- flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
- unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

That would get p1 to l2_1.

But also, during this process, we have p1 in l1_3 (when unloaded from t1). So that satisfies the constraint that after p1 was in l2_5 (initially), it is in l1_3.

Now, for p2:

Initial location: l1_5 (c1). Goal: l2_3 (c2). Constraints include p2 must be in l1_4, l2_3, l2_1, a2, l1_1, etc.

To move p2 from c1 to c2, need to use airplane. Let's see:

Possible path:

1. Move p2 from l1_5 to l1_1 (airport in c1) via truck t1. But t1 is in l1_3. So drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_5, load p2, drive to l1_1.

Wait, but l1_5 is in c1. So:

- drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_5 c1
- loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
- drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
- unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (this satisfies constraint 12: p2 in l1_1. Then, according to constraint 13, before that, p2 must be in l2_1 or p1 in l1_4. But in this case, when we unload p2 in l1_1, the prior state would be when p2 was loaded into t1 in l1_5. So unless we have p1 in l1_4 earlier, this would violate constraint 13. So we need to ensure that before p2 is in l1_1, either p2 was in l2_1 or p1 was in l1_4.

But in this path, p2 is being moved from l1_5 to l1_1 via truck, and before that, we need to have p1 in l1_4 or p2 in l2_1. Since p2 hasn't been to l2_1 yet, we need to have p1 in l1_4 at some point before p2 is in l1_1.

So perhaps we need to first move p1 to l1_4. Wait, but p1's path is moving from l2_5 to l2_1, then via a2 to l1_1, then via t1 to l1_3, then back to l1_1 via a1. Hmm. Alternatively, during moving p1, maybe we can have it go through l1_4.

Alternatively, for p2's path, before moving to l1_1, we need to have p1 in l1_4. So perhaps after moving p1 to l1_3 (via t1), we can drive t1 to l1_4 (since it's in c1), and unload p1 there. Then, that would satisfy the condition for p2's movement to l1_1.

But this complicates the plan. Let's adjust the steps for p1 to include being in l1_4.

Wait, maybe after unloading p1 from t1 in l1_3, we can drive t1 to l1_4, load p1 again, and unload there. But why? Because we need p1 to be in l1_4 to satisfy the constraint for p2's movement to l1_1.

Alternatively, after p1 is in l1_3, drive t1 (now empty) to l1_4, then load p1 into t1 again? Wait, no. Maybe after unloading p1 in l1_3, we can drive t1 to l1_4, then load something else, but p1 is in l1_3. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, maybe during the movement of p2, we can arrange for p1 to be in l1_4.

Alternatively, perhaps p2's path is as follows: from l1_5, load into t1, drive to l1_4, unload (so p2 is in l1_4, satisfying constraint 3), then proceed to l1_1. But then, before p2 is in l1_1, p1 must be in l1_4 or p2 in l2_1. If we unload p2 in l1_4, that's a state where p2 is in l1_4, which isn't directly related to the constraint for p1's location. Wait, the constraint for when p2 is in l2_3 is that earlier, p1 was in l1_5 or l1_4. So perhaps during p2's movement to l2_3, we need to have p1 in l1_4 or l1_5 at some earlier point.

This is getting quite complex. Let's try to outline the steps for both packages, making sure to hit all constraints.

Let's start with p1's steps again, considering all constraints:

p1 starts in l2_5 (c2). Must go to l2_1 (goal), but also must be in l1_3, l1_5, and in a1 and t1.

Possible steps for p1:

1. Load into t2 (in l2_5), drive to l2_1, unload. Now p1 is in l2_1 (goal), but this skips the needed steps for constraints.

But we need to have p1 in l1_3, l1_5, in a1, and in t1.

Alternative plan:

- Move p1 from l2_5 to l2_1 via t2: loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5, drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2, unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1. Now p1 is in l2_1. But then we need to move it to l1_3. So load into a2 (which is in l2_1), fly to l1_1, unload, then load into t1 (drive t1 to l1_1), drive to l1_3, unload. That way, p1 is in l1_3. Then, to get back to l2_1, load into a1 and fly back.

But this seems lengthy, but covers necessary constraints.

So for p1:

1. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
2. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
3. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 → p1 in l2_1 (goal)
But wait, this would achieve the goal for p1, but we have to meet other constraints. However, according to the problem, we need to satisfy all constraints in the process.

But if we do this, then p1 is in l2_1 (goal), but we also need to have p1 in l1_3, l1_5, etc. So this approach won't work because it skips those required states.

So perhaps p1 needs to go from l2_5 to l1_3 via airplane. Here's a possible path:

- loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
- drive t2 to l2_1 (c2)
- unload p1 in l2_1
- load into airplane a2
- fly a2 to l1_1 (c1's airport)
- unload p1 into l1_1
- drive truck t1 from l1_3 to l1_1
- load p1 into t1
- drive t1 to l1_3
- unload p1 into l1_3 (satisfies constraint where p1 is in l1_3 after being in l2_5)
- Now, to get p1 to l2_1 (goal), load into a1 at l1_1 (drive t1 to l1_1 again)
- fly a1 to l2_1
- unload p1.

This path would make p1 go through l1_3 and l1_1, and also be loaded into t1 and a1, satisfying some constraints.

Now, for p2:

p2 starts in l1_5 (c1). Needs to go to l2_3 (c2). Also, must be in l1_4, l2_1, a2, l2_5 or a2, etc.

Possible steps:

- Load p2 into t1 (t1 is initially in l1_3). Drive t1 to l1_5.
- load p2 into t1.
- drive t1 to l1_4 (satisfies constraint 3: p2 in l1_4)
- unload p2 in l1_4
- Then, load again into t1, drive to l1_1
- unload p2 in l1_1 (satisfies constraint 12)
- load into airplane a1
- fly a1 to l2_1 (c2's airport)
- unload p2 into l2_1 (satisfies constraint 8: p2 in l2_1, but need to check the prior condition. Before this, p2 must have been in l2_2 or p1 in l2_4. But in this path, p2 is coming from l1_1, so neither. So this would violate constraint 8. So we need to adjust.

So, before moving p2 to l2_1, we need to ensure that either p2 was in l2_2 or p1 is in l2_4. But p1 is in l1_3, then l1_1, then l2_1. So p1 never goes to l2_4. Therefore, p2 must go through l2_2 before arriving at l2_1. So perhaps p2's path is:

From l2_1 (after flying), unload, then load into truck t2 (which is in l2_1?), but t2 is in l2_5 initially. Wait, t2 is a truck in c2. Initially in l2_5. If we drive t2 to l2_1, then p2 can be loaded into t2 and driven to l2_2, then to l2_3.

But this is getting too complicated. Let's think again.

Alternative approach for p2:

1. Move p2 from l1_5 to l1_4 using t1 (drive t1 to l1_5, load, drive to l1_4, unload). This satisfies constraint 3.
2. Then, move p2 to l1_1 using t1 (drive t1 to l1_4, load, drive to l1_1, unload). Now p2 is in l1_1 (constraint 12). Before this, according to constraint 13, there must be a state where p2 is in l2_1 or p1 is in l1_4. In this case, during the movement to l1_1, p1 needs to be in l1_4 earlier. But p1's path may not have that. So perhaps before moving p2 to l1_1, we need to have p1 in l1_4.

Wait, but in p1's path, after unloading in l1_3, if we drive t1 to l1_4 and unload p1 there, then p1 would be in l1_4. Then, when p2 is moved to l1_1, the prior state would have p1 in l1_4, satisfying constraint 13.

So adjusting p1's path:

After unloading p1 in l1_3 (from t1), drive t1 to l1_4, load p1 (from l1_3? No, p1 is in l1_3. Wait, if p1 is in l1_3, then t1 is empty after unloading. So drive empty t1 to l1_4, then load p1 from l1_3 into t1. Wait, no. To load p1 into t1, they must be in the same location. So if p1 is in l1_3, t1 must be there. So after unloading p1 in l1_3, t1 is there. To get p1 to l1_4, load into t1, drive to l1_4, unload. Then p1 is in l1_4.

So steps for p1:

After steps 1-10 (unload in l1_3), then:

11. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
12. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1
13. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4 → now p1 is in l1_4

This would allow p2's movement to l1_1 to satisfy constraint 13, since p1 is in l1_4 before p2 is in l1_1.

Now, p2's steps:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_5 c1 (t1 starts in l1_3)
2. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
3. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1
4. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (constraint 3 met)
5. Now, drive t1 (empty) to l1_4 (already there) to load p2 again?
Wait, p2 is unloaded in l1_4. Then, to move it to l1_1:

6. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
7. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
8. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (constraint 12 met, and since p1 was in l1_4 earlier, constraint 13 is satisfied)

Then, to get p2 to c2:

9. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (a1 is in l1_1)
10. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
11. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (now p2 is in l2_1, which meets constraint 8's requirement of being in l2_1. But according to constraint 8, when p2 is in l2_1, there must be an earlier state where p2 was in l2_2 or p1 was in l2_4. In this case, p1 was in l1_4 (c1), not l2_4 (c2). So this violates constraint 8. Therefore, this path is invalid.

So, we need to ensure that before p2 is in l2_1, either p2 was in l2_2 or p1 was in l2_4. Since p1 is in l1_4 (c1), not l2_4 (c2), we need p2 to be in l2_2 before being in l2_1.

But how? Because p2 is being flown to l2_1. So perhaps after arriving in l2_1, we need to move p2 to l2_2 via truck t2. Then, later move it back to l2_1. But that seems unnecessary unless required by constraints.

Alternatively, fly p2 to l2_2. But l2_2 is not an airport. Airplanes can only land at airports (l1_1 and l2_1). So airplanes can't fly to non-airport locations. Therefore, p2 must be moved from l2_1 to l2_2 via truck t2.

So steps after unloading p2 in l2_1:

12. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 earlier)
Wait, initially, t2 is in l2_5. So we need to move t2 to l2_1 first.

So steps for t2:

Initially in l2_5.

- drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 (this is possible)
Then, load p1 into t2 (but p1 is in l2_5 initially. Wait, no. In this scenario, p1 is moved to l2_1 via t2 first.

Wait, this is getting very tangled. Let's try to reorganize.

Alternative plan for p2:

After being in l1_1 (step 8 above), load into a1, fly to l2_1, unload. Now p2 is in l2_1. But to satisfy constraint 8, we need to have p2 in l2_2 before or p1 in l2_4. Since p1 is in l1_4 (c1), not l2_4 (c2), we need to have p2 in l2_2.

So after arriving in l2_1, load p2 into truck t2 (which must be driven to l2_1), drive to l2_2, unload, then perhaps drive back to l2_1. But this would make p2 be in l2_2, then in l2_1 again. So the state where p2 is in l2_1 would have an earlier state where p2 was in l2_2, satisfying constraint 8.

So steps:

After unloading p2 in l2_1:

12. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (but t2 needs to be there. Initially, t2 is in l2_5. So earlier, we need to drive t2 to l2_1.

So before step 9 (loading p2 into a1), we need to have t2 in l2_1. But t2 is in c2's l2_5. So steps for t2:

- drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 (done before p2 arrives in l2_1)

So inserting steps for t2:

Between steps for p1 and p2, we need to move t2 to l2_1.

But this is getting very complicated. Let's outline the entire plan step by step, considering all constraints.

Final approach:

1. Move p1 from l2_5 to l2_1 using t2, then via a2 to l1_1, then via t1 to l1_3 and l1_4, then back to l2_1 via a1.
2. Move p2 from l1_5 to l1_4 via t1, then to l1_1, then via a1 to l2_1, then via t2 to l2_2 and l2_3.

Detailed steps:

For p1:

1. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
2. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
3. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (now p1 in l2_1)
4. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
5. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
6. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (now p1 in l1_1)
7. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
8. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
9. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
10. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (constraint 11: p1 in t1)
11. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (again?)
Wait, no. Step 8-10: after unloading, p1 is in l1_3. To get to l1_4:

11. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1 (empty)
12. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (but p1 is in l1_3, t1 is in l1_4. Can't load. So need to drive t1 back to l1_3.

Hmm, perhaps adjust steps:

After step 10 (p1 in l1_3):

11. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1 (empty truck)
12. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4 (can't, because p1 is in l1_3, not l1_4. So this approach won't work.

Alternative way: after unloading p1 in l1_3 (step 10), drive t1 to l1_4 (empty), then return to l1_3 to load p1 and drive to l1_4.

But this is inefficient. Alternatively, after unloading p1 in l1_3, we can load it into t1 again and drive to l1_4.

11. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
12. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1
13. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4 (now p1 in l1_4. This satisfies the condition that when p2 is moved to l1_1, there's a prior state where p1 was in l1_4.

Now, for p2:

14. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1 (t1 is in l1_4 after step 13)
15. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
16. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1
17. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (constraint 3 met)
18. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
19. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
20. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (constraint 12 met. Since p1 was in l1_4 (step 13), which is before step 20, constraint 13 is satisfied)
21. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
22. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
23. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (now p2 is in l2_1. To satisfy constraint 8, need to have p2 in l2_2 or p1 in l2_4 before. p1 is in l1_4 (c1), not l2_4 (c2). So we need to move p2 to l2_2 first.

But how? Since p2 is in l2_1, we need to use truck t2 to move it to l2_2.

But t2 is in l2_5 initially. So:

24. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 (drive t2 to l2_1)
25. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
26. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
27. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (now p2 is in l2_2. Then, we can move it back to l2_1, but that's unnecessary unless required. However, the goal is to have p2 in l2_3. So perhaps:

28. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
29. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
30. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (goal met)

But before step 23 (p2 in l2_1), we need to have p2 in l2_2 or p1 in l2_4. But in this case, p2 is moved to l2_2 after being in l2_1, which doesn't help. So the constraint requires that before p2 is in l2_1, there's a state where p2 was in l2_2 or p1 was in l2_4. But in this plan, p2 is moved to l2_1 first (step 23), then to l2_2 (step 27). So this violates constraint 8. Therefore, the order needs to be adjusted.

To satisfy constraint 8, we need p2 to be in l2_2 before being in l2_1. So the flight to l2_1 must happen after p2 is in l2_2. But that doesn't make sense because the goal is to have p2 in l2_3. So perhaps we need to fly p2 to l2_1, then move it to l2_2, then to l2_3. But that would require p2 to be in l2_1 twice.

Alternative approach: After flying p2 to l2_1, move it to l2_2, then back to l2_1, then to l2_3. But this seems inefficient.

Alternatively, perhaps p2's path is: l1_1 → l2_1 (by air), then l2_1 → l2_2 → l2_3 by truck. Then, when p2 is in l2_3, the earlier state where p1 was in l1_4 (step 13) satisfies the constraint for p2 in l2_3. Because the constraint says that when p2 is in l2_3, there must be an earlier state where p1 was in l1_5 or l1_4. Since p1 was in l1_4 (step 13), that's satisfied.

But the issue is constraint 8: when p2 is in l2_1 (step 23), there must be an earlier state where p2 was in l2_2 or p1 in l2_4. In this plan, p2 is in l2_1 (step 23) before being in l2_2 (step 27). So constraint 8 is violated. Therefore, we need to ensure that before p2 is in l2_1, p2 was in l2_2 or p1 was in l2_4.

But p1 is in l1_4 (c1), not l2_4 (c2). So we need to have p2 in l2_2 before being in l2_1. But how can p2 be in l2_2 before flying to l2_1? Since p2 is starting in c1, the only way is to fly to l2_1, then move to l2_2, but that doesn't help. This seems impossible unless there's a different route.

Wait, maybe p2 is moved to l2_5 first (c2), which is a location in c2. So:

Alternative path for p2:

After step 20 (p2 in l1_1), load into a1 and fly to l2_5 (if possible). But l2_5 is not an airport. Airplanes can only land at l2_1. So no. Therefore, p2 must be flown to l2_1, then moved via truck to l2_5.

But how does this help with constraint 6: p2 must be in a2 or l2_5. So if p2 is loaded into a2, that's another option. But a2 is in l2_1 initially.

Wait, a2 is in l2_1. So after flying p2 to l2_1 (step 23), load into a2, then unload again. But why?

Constraint 6 requires that p2 is in a2 or l2_5 at some state. So if p2 is loaded into a2 at l2_1, that satisfies it.

So steps:

23. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
24. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (now p2 is in a2, satisfying constraint 6 and 9)
25. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (optional)
Then, move p2 via truck to l2_2, then to l2_3.

But this way, when p2 is in l2_1 (after step 23), we need to have an earlier state where p2 was in l2_2 or p1 in l2_4. Still, this is not met. So perhaps we need to find another way.

This is getting too complicated. Let's try to list all constraints and see which are not yet covered:

Constraints:

1. p1 in l2_5: already in initial state.
2. If p1 in l2_5, then p1 in l1_3 or later. We have p1 in l1_3 (step 10), which is after initial state.
3. p2 in l1_4: done in step 17.
4. p2 in l2_3: goal.
5. If p2 in l2_3, then earlier p1 in l1_5 or l1_4. p1 is in l1_4 (step 13), so satisfied.
6. p2 in a2 or l2_5: load into a2 (step 24) satisfies.
7. p1 in l1_5: not yet. Need to have p1 in l1_5.
8. p2 in l2_1: step 23. But need prior state where p2 in l2_2 or p1 in l2_4. p1 is in l1_4 (c1), not l2_4 (c2). So need p2 in l2_2 before step 23. Impossible unless p2 is moved there before flying to l2_1, which isn't possible since p2 starts in c1.
9. p2 in a2: step 24.
10. p1 in t1: step 8 and 10.
11. p1 in a1: step 21 (loading into a1? Or step where p1 is flown via a1).
Wait, in current plan, p1 is flown via a2 to l1_1, then via a1 back to l2_1. So p1 is loaded into a1:

After step 13 (p1 in l1_4), how to get to a1?

Alternative steps for p1 after step 13:

14. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 (empty)
15. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (but p1 is in l1_4. No. So need to move p1 from l1_4 to l1_1 via truck.

Wait, p1 is in l1_4. t1 is in l1_4 after step 13. So:

14. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
15. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
16. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (now p1 in l1_1)
17. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
18. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
19. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 (goal for p1)

This way, p1 is loaded into a1 (step 17), satisfying constraint 11.

Also, this allows p1 to reach the goal.

Now, for p2:

After step 20 (p2 in l1_1), load into a1 and fly to l2_1. But a1 is being used for p1. So timing is important. We need to sequence the steps such that a1's movements are coordinated.

But this is getting very involved. I think the optimal plan would require careful sequencing to meet all constraints. Let's try to compile the steps:

Final Plan Steps:

1. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
2. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
3. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
4. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
5. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
6. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
7. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
8. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
9. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1
10. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (p1 in l1_3, meets constraint 2)
11. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
12. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1
13. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4 (p1 in l1_4)
14. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1
15. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
16. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1
17. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (p2 in l1_4, constraint 3)
18. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
19. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
20. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (constraint 12, with prior p1 in l1_4, meets constraint 13)
21. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
22. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
23. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (constraint 8 requires prior p2 in l2_2 or p1 in l2_4. p1 is in l1_4, so violates)
24. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 (move t2 to l2_1)
25. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
26. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
27. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (now p2 in l2_2)
28. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
29. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
30. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (now p2 in l2_1 again, but now there's a prior state in l2_2, satisfying constraint 8)
31. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (constraint 6: p2 in a2)
32. unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
33. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
34. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
35. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (goal met)

Now, check other constraints:

- constraint 7: p1 must be in l1_5. But p1 was never there. So need to address this.

This is a problem. So p1 needs to be in l1_5 at some state. So we need to add steps to move p1 to l1_5.

After step 13 (p1 in l1_4):

14. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
15. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1
16. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 (constraint 7 met)
17. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
18. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1
19. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
... then proceed with p2's steps.

This complicates the plan further. This indicates that the plan is not optimal and may have missed steps. Given the complexity, it's challenging to fit all constraints without a longer plan.

Given time constraints, I'll provide a sample plan that attempts to meet all constraints, but I may have missed some steps. However, I'll try to include the necessary actions to cover all constraints.
