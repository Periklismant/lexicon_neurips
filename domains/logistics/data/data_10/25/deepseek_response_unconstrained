drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_3 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
```
```

Wait, but this is 8 steps. Wait, earlier I thought handling p2 first would take 7 steps, but this approach takes 8. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assessment.

Wait, maybe the correct optimal plan is the following:

1. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5

2. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2

3. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

4. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2

5. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

6. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2

7. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

That's 7 steps. Let's verify:

- After step 3, p2 is in l2_1, which is the goal.

- Then steps 4-7 handle p1.

Yes, that's correct and shorter. So why did I think of an 8-step plan earlier? Because I considered moving back to l2_5, but that's unnecessary. Wait, in this case, after unloading p2 at l2_1 (step 3), the truck is at l2_1. To get p1 from l2_3, the truck drives directly from l2_1 to l2_3 (step 4), which is allowed. Then load p1, drive to l2_2, unload. So steps 4-7. That's four steps for p1. Total 7 steps.

So that's better. So the optimal plan is 7 steps.

So the correct answer is:

```
drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_3 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
```

Wait, no. The 7-step plan is:

1. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5

2. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2

3. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

4. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2

5. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

6. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2

7. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

That's correct. Because after step 3, p2 is done. Then steps 4-7 handle p1. So why did I write the 8-step plan earlier? Because I thought of moving back to l2_5, but that's not needed. The correct plan is 7 steps.

But let's check the initial positions again. p2 is at l2_5, t2 is also at l2_5. So step 1: load p2 into t2. Then drive to l2_1 (airport), unload. That's steps 1-3. Then, drive to l2_3 (step4), load p1 (step5), drive to l2_2 (step6), unload (step7). So yes, that's 7 steps. This is optimal.

So the answer should be these seven actions:

loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5

drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2

unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2

loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2

unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

Yes, this gets both packages to their destinations in 7 steps.

But wait, when you unload p2 at l2_1, the truck is there. Then drive to l2_3, which is allowed. Then proceed. So that's the correct plan.

So the final answer is:

```
```
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
```
