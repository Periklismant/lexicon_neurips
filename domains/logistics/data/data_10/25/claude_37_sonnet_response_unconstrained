Let me solve this logistics planning problem step by step:

First, let me review the initial state:
- Locations l1_1, l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5 are in city c1
- Locations l2_1, l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5 are in city c2
- Package t1 is in location l1_3 (this seems to be a typo, t1 should be a truck)
- Package t2 is in location l2_5 (this seems to be a typo, t2 should be a truck)
- Package p1 is in location l2_3
- Package p2 is in location l2_5
- Package a1 is in location l1_1 (this seems to be a typo, a1 should be an airplane)
- Package a2 is in location l2_1 (this seems to be a typo, a2 should be an airplane)

I think there's a typo in the initial state description. The descriptions for trucks t1, t2 and airplanes a1, a2 are mistakenly labeled as packages. Let me assume the following corrections to the initial state:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_3
- Truck t2 is in location l2_5
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

And the goal state is:
- Package p1 is in location l2_2
- Package p2 is in location l2_1

Package p1 is currently in l2_3 (city c2) and needs to go to l2_2 (also in city c2)
Package p2 is currently in l2_5 (city c2) and needs to go to l2_1 (also in city c2)

Since both packages are already in the right city, we don't need to use airplanes. We just need to use trucks to move them around within city c2.

Let's plan the movements for each package:

For p1 (from l2_3 to l2_2):
1. Drive truck t2 from l2_5 to l2_3
2. Load p1 into t2 at l2_3
3. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_2
4. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_2

For p2 (from l2_5 to l2_1):
1. Load p2 into t2 at l2_5 (this would be before we move t2 to get p1)
2. After dropping p1 at l2_2, drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1
3. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1

Let me put this together into a complete plan:

1. Load p2 into t2 at l2_5
2. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_3
3. Load p1 into t2 at l2_3
4. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_2
5. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_2
6. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1
7. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1

This plan seems optimal as it:
1. Handles both packages using the most convenient truck (t2)
2. Uses the minimum number of actions needed

Let me check if there are any issues or if we could make the plan more efficient:

- We're not using truck t1 or either airplane since all movements are within city c2
- We're loading both packages into t2, but at different times to ensure efficiency

I think this plan is valid and optimal.

Actually, I just realized there might be an issue with my plan. Let me re-examine the initial state again to make sure I have the positions correct:

- Truck t1 is in l1_3 (city c1)
- Truck t2 is in l2_5 (city c2)
- Package p1 is in l2_3 (city c2)
- Package p2 is in l2_5 (city c2)

For package p1, we need to move it from l2_3 to l2_2:
1. Drive truck t2 from l2_5 to l2_3
2. Load p1 into t2 at l2_3
3. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_2
4. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_2

For package p2, we need to move it from l2_5 to l2_1:
1. Drive truck t2 back from l2_2 to l2_5
2. Load p2 into t2 at l2_5
3. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1
4. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1

This revised plan takes more steps. Let me check if there's a more efficient solution:

What if we do them in a different order?
1. Drive truck t2 from l2_5 to l2_3
2. Load p1 into t2 at l2_3
3. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_5
4. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_5 (temporary)
5. Load p2 into t2 at l2_5
6. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1
7. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1
8. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_5
9. Load p1 into t2 at l2_5
10. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2
11. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_2

This is even less efficient.

Actually, wait. I think I've been making this more complicated than necessary. Let's go back to the original problem. I'm concerned I may have misunderstood something.

Ok, let's be very precise:

Initial state:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_3
- Truck t2 is in location l2_5
- Package p1 is in location l2_3
- Package p2 is in location l2_5
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

Goal:
- Package p1 is in location l2_2
- Package p2 is in location l2_1

For p1: We need to move it from l2_3 to l2_2, both in city c2
For p2: We need to move it from l2_5 to l2_1, both in city c2

Let's focus on what resources we have available in city c2:
- Truck t2 (at l2_5)
- Airplane a2 (at l2_1)

Using the truck t2 for both packages seems most efficient:

For p1:
1. Drive truck t2 from l2_5 to l2_3
2. Load p1 into t2 at l2_3
3. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_2
4. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_2

For p2:
1. Drive truck t2 from l2_2 to l2_5
2. Load p2 into t2 at l2_5
3. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1
4. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1

This gives us 8 steps.

Let me see if there's a more efficient approach using both truck t2 and airplane a2:

For p1:
1. Drive truck t2 from l2_5 to l2_3
2. Load p1 into t2 at l2_3
3. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_2
4. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_2

For p2:
1. Load p2 into t2 at l2_5 (But this would have to happen before we move t2 to get p1)
2. If we loaded p2 first, we'd have to:
   a. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_3 (with p2 onboard)
   b. Load p1 into t2 at l2_3
   c. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_2
   d. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_2
   e. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1
   f. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1

That's also 8 steps.

Let me try another approach - what if we use airplane a2 for package p2?

1. Drive truck t2 from l2_5 to l2_3
2. Load p1 into t2 at l2_3
3. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_2
4. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_2
5. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_5
6. Load p2 into t2 at l2_5
7. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1
8. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1

That's 8 steps again.

Actually, let's try a completely different approach. What if we consider the following plan?

1. Drive truck t2 from l2_5 to l2_3
2. Load p1 into t2 at l2_3
3. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_2
4. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_2
5. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1
6. Drive airplane a2 from l2_1 to l2_5
7. Load p2 into a2 at l2_5
8. Fly a2 from l2_5 to l2_1
9. Unload p2 from a2 at l2_1

That's 9 steps, which is actually more.

Let me think if I'm missing anything...

Wait, I think I've been making a conceptual error. Looking at the action descriptions more carefully:
- "flyairplane": You may only fly an airplane ap from location l_from to location l_to if ap is situated in l_from.

It seems that airplanes can fly between any locations, not just airports. But then I notice the context says "airplanes may move between airports."

Let me double-check these constraints:
- Trucks can move between locations in a city
- Airplanes can move between airports

And from the initial state:
- "airport l1_1"
- "airport l2_1"

So l1_1 and l2_1 are the only airports. I think my understanding is correct.

Given this information, let's reconsider our plan:

For p1 (from l2_3 to l2_2):
1. Drive truck t2 from l2_5 to l2_3
2. Load p1 into t2 at l2_3
3. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_2
4. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_2

For p2 (from l2_5 to l2_1):
5. Drive truck t2 from l2_2 to l2_5
6. Load p2 into t2 at l2_5
7. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1
8. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1

This seems to be the optimal plan with 8 steps.

Actually, let me analyze another option. Let's say we use a2 for p2. The airplane a2 is already at l2_1 (the airport in city c2), but package p2 is at l2_5. We would need to bring p2 to the airport first, then it doesn't make sense to use the airplane since the package already reached its destination.

So, our final, optimal plan is:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_3 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
3. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
5. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
6. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
7. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
8. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

This is an 8-step plan that achieves both goals.

Actually, I need to check one more thing. Is there a way to reduce the number of steps by loading both packages before delivering either?

Let's see:
1. Drive truck t2 from l2_5 to l2_3
2. Load p1 into t2 at l2_3
3. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_5
4. Load p2 into t2 at l2_5
5. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2
6. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_2
7. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1
8. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1

This is also 8 steps. But it might be more complex logistically (carrying two packages at once).

Ok, I think our first plan is the optimal solution with 8 steps.

Wait, I just realized I made a mistake in the problem statement. The problem states "Package t1 is in location l1_3" and "Package t2 is in location l2_5", but t1 and t2 should be trucks, not packages. Similarly, "Package a1" and "Package a2" should be airplanes, not packages.

Let me re-analyze this with the correct understanding:

Initial state:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_3 (city c1)
- Truck t2 is in location l2_5 (city c2)
- Package p1 is in location l2_3 (city c2)
- Package p2 is in location l2_5 (city c2)
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (airport in city c1)
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1 (airport in city c2)

Goal:
- Package p1 is in location l2_2 (city c2)
- Package p2 is in location l2_1 (airport in city c2)

Our plan would be:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_3 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
3. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
5. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
6. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
7. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
8. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

This delivers:
- p1 to l2_2 (as required)
- p2 to l2_1 (as required)

And it takes 8 steps, which I believe is optimal.

Let me check if I can optimize this plan any further:

Another approach could be:
1. Drive truck t2 from l2_5 to l2_3
2. Load p1 into t2 at l2_3
3. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_2
4. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_2
5. Load p2 into airplane a2 at l2_1 (but wait, p2 is at l2_5, not l2_1)

So this doesn't work either. 

One more approach, using both truck t2 and airplane a2:
1. Load p2 into t2 at l2_5
2. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1
3. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1
4. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_3
5. Load p1 into t2 at l2_3
6. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_2
7. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_2

This is 7 steps, which would be more efficient than our previous 8-step plan.

I think this is the optimal solution, with 7 steps:

1. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
2. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
3. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
4. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
5. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
6. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2
7. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

Let me verify this plan again to ensure it's correct:

1. We load p2 into t2 at l2_5 (both are at l2_5)
2. We drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1 (within city c2)
3. We unload p2 from t2 at l2_1 (first goal achieved)
4. We drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_3 (within city c2)
5. We load p1 into t2 at l2_3 (both are at l2_3)
6. We drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_2 (within city c2)
7. We unload p1 from t2 at l2_2 (second goal achieved)

This plan correctly achieves both goals and is one step shorter than our previous plan. I believe this is the optimal solution.

Wait, I think I misunderstood the format of the unload actions. Let me correct that:

1. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
2. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
3. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
4. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
5. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
6. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2
7. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

This looks like the correct, optimal plan.

Actually, I just realized I'm not correctly following the action format. Let me fix that:

1. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
2. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
3. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
4. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
5. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
6. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2
7. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

This is the correct format and matches the optimal plan I've identified.

Actually, I need to double-check the unloadairplane action. The original problem description has duplicate actions:
"loadairplane p ap l": Load package p in airplane ap. Both p and ap are in location l.
"loadairplane p ap l": Unload package p from airplane ap in location l.

This seems to be a typo. Based on the context, the second one should be "unloadairplane p ap l". I'll use that assumption.

Let me double-check my solution one more time:

1. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
2. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
3. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
4. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
5. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
6. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_2 c2
7. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_2

This plan correctly moves:
- p2 from l2_5 to l2_1
- p1 from l2_3 to l2_2

The plan is valid and I believe it's optimal at 7 steps.
