Let me analyze the provided problem:

1. We have two cities: c1 and c2.
2. Each city has 5 locations. The first location (l1_1 in c1, l2_1 in c2) is an airport.
3. We have two trucks (t1 and t2) and two airplanes (a1 and a2).
4. We have two packages (p1 and p2).

The initial state is:
- t1 is in location l1_4 (city c1)
- t2 is in location l2_4 (city c2)
- p1 is in location l1_4 (city c1)
- p2 is in location l1_4 (city c1)
- a1 is in location l1_1 (city c1, airport)
- a2 is in location l2_1 (city c2, airport)

The goal is:
- p1 should be in location l2_5 (city c2)
- p2 should be in location l1_5 (city c1)

However, I notice there's an issue with the initial state specification. It says "Package t1", "Package t2", "Package a1", "Package a2". These are trucks and airplanes, not packages. Let me assume the correct interpretation:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_4 (city c1)
- Truck t2 is in location l2_4 (city c2)
- Package p1 is in location l1_4 (city c1)
- Package p2 is in location l1_4 (city c1)
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (city c1, airport)
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1 (city c2, airport)

Now, let's plan for each package:

For p1 (from l1_4 in c1 to l2_5 in c2):
1. Load p1 into truck t1 at l1_4.
2. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1 (airport in c1).
3. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1.
4. Load p1 into airplane a1 at l1_1.
5. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1 (airport in c2).
6. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1.
7. Load p1 into truck t2 at l2_1.
8. Wait, we'd need to first drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
   So, let's revise:
   7. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
   8. Load p1 into truck t2 at l2_1.
   9. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_5.
   10. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_5.

For p2 (from l1_4 in c1 to l1_5 in c1):
1. Load p2 into truck t1 at l1_4.
2. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_5.
3. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_5.

However, there's a potential issue with the order of actions. If we use truck t1 to transport both p1 and p2, we need to ensure they are handled in the right order. This is what we'll need to ensure.

Let's combine the plans carefully:

1. Load p1 into truck t1 at l1_4.
2. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1 (airport in c1).
3. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1.
4. Load p1 into airplane a1 at l1_1.
5. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1 (airport in c2).
6. Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1.
7. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.
8. Load p1 into truck t2 at l2_1.
9. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_5.
10. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_5.
11. Drive t1 from l1_1 back to l1_4.
12. Load p2 into truck t1 at l1_4.
13. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_5.
14. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_5.

Let's verify the plan:

At the start:
- p1 is in l1_4, t1 is in l1_4, t2 is in l2_4, a1 is in l1_1, a2 is in l2_1.

1. `loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4`: p1 is now in t1.
2. `drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1`: t1 (with p1) is now in l1_1.
3. `unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1`: p1 is now in l1_1.
4. `loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1`: p1 is now in a1.
5. `flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1`: a1 (with p1) is now in l2_1.
6. `unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1`: p1 is now in l2_1.
7. `drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2`: t2 is now in l2_1.
8. `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1`: p1 is now in t2.
9. `drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2`: t2 (with p1) is now in l2_5.
10. `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5`: p1 is now in l2_5.
11. `drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1`: t1 is now in l1_4.
12. `loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4`: p2 is now in t1.
13. `drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1`: t1 (with p2) is now in l1_5.
14. `unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5`: p2 is now in l1_5.

At the end:
- p1 is in l2_5.
- p2 is in l1_5.
- This satisfies the goal.

This is one possible plan. Now, let's see if we can find a more efficient plan:

For p1, the route l1_4 -> l1_1 -> l2_1 -> l2_5 via air and then truck seems optimal.
For p2, the route l1_4 -> l1_5 via truck seems optimal.

I notice we don't need to make t1 go back to l1_4 since we can transport p2 to l1_5 before we use t1 for p1. Let's try that:

1. `loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4`: p2 is now in t1.
2. `drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1`: t1 (with p2) is now in l1_5.
3. `unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5`: p2 is now in l1_5.
4. `drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1`: t1 is now in l1_4.
5. `loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4`: p1 is now in t1.
6. `drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1`: t1 (with p1) is now in l1_1.
7. `unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1`: p1 is now in l1_1.
8. `loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1`: p1 is now in a1.
9. `flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1`: a1 (with p1) is now in l2_1.
10. `unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1`: p1 is now in l2_1.
11. `drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2`: t2 is now in l2_1.
12. `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1`: p1 is now in t2.
13. `drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2`: t2 (with p1) is now in l2_5.
14. `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5`: p1 is now in l2_5.

This plan achieves the goal and is of the same length as the original plan.

Wait, I think we can be more efficient. Notice that both p1 and p2 start in the same location (l1_4). We could potentially transport both of them simultaneously if we're headed in a common direction. But in this case, they're headed in different directions, so that's not helpful.

Let's question if our solution is optimal. We're transporting packages in this order:
1. First p2, then p1.
2. Using t1 for p2 and then for part of p1's journey, and t2 for the final part of p1's journey.

Could we do it in a different order or using the vehicles differently?

For p1, it needs to go from l1_4 to l2_5, which requires an airplane to cross between cities. Since a1 is at l1_1, it's a natural choice.
For p2, it needs to go from l1_4 to l1_5, which is in the same city. t1 is a natural choice for this.

One alternative approach is to use a2 instead of a1 for p1, but a2 is in l2_1, and p1 is in l1_4. We'd need to fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1, then use t1 to get p1 to l1_1, and then fly a2 back to l2_1 with p1. This doesn't seem more efficient.

Let's also consider using t2 for p1 from the beginning. t2 is in l2_4, so we'd first need to get it to l1_4 in c1, which again requires an airplane journey.

The solution we proposed seems efficient without any apparent optimizations. However, there's always the chance of a more efficient solution. Let's revisit the actions once more:

1. `loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4`
2. `drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1`
3. `unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5`
4. `drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1`
5. `loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4`
6. `drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1`
7. `unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1`
8. `loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1`
9. `flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1`
10. `unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1`
11. `drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2`
12. `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1`
13. `drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2`
14. `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5`

One observation is that we might be wasting steps by going back and forth with t1. Instead of first handling p2 and then going back to get p1, we could handle p1 first and then p2. Let's see:

1. `loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4`
2. `drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1`
3. `unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1`
4. `loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1`
5. `flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1`
6. `unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1`
7. `drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2`
8. `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1`
9. `drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2`
10. `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5`
11. `drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1`
12. `loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4`
13. `drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1`
14. `unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5`

This is still 14 steps. The issue is that t1 needs to go back to l1_4 to pick up p2, and this step is inevitable.

Let's see if there's a way to pick up both p1 and p2 with t1 at the same time, and then drop them off as needed:

1. `loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4`
2. `loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4`
3. `drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1`
4. `unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5`
5. `drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1`
6. `unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1`
7. `loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1`
8. `flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1`
9. `unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1`
10. `drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2`
11. `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1`
12. `drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2`
13. `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5`

This is 13 steps, which is more efficient.

Wait, I'm noticing something from the provided problem description. It says:
- The world may also include trucks, airplanes and packages

And then in the initial state:
- "Package t1 is in location l1_4"
- "Package t2 is in location l2_4"
- "Package p1 is in location l1_4"
- "Package p2 is in location l1_4"
- "Package a1 is in location l1_1"
- "Package a2 is in location l2_1"

It seems like t1, t2, a1, and a2 are being referred to as packages. But from the domain description, they should be trucks and airplanes. Let me assume that the problem description might have a typo, and the correct interpretation is:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_4
- Truck t2 is in location l2_4
- Package p1 is in location l1_4
- Package p2 is in location l1_4
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

With this interpretation, our solution is valid and seems efficient. Let's finalize the 13-step plan:

1. `loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4`
2. `loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4`
3. `drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1`
4. `unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5`
5. `drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1`
6. `unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1`
7. `loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1`
8. `flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1`
9. `unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1`
10. `drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2`
11. `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1`
12. `drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2`
13. `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5`

Hmm, wait. There's a definition of "loadairplane" provided twice, and no definition for "unloadairplane". Let me assume "unloadairplane" has the same logic as "unloadtruck" but for airplanes.

Now, let's once more check if our 13-step plan is valid and optimal.

Let's break it down step by step and see what happens:

Start:
- t1 is in l1_4
- t2 is in l2_4
- a1 is in l1_1
- a2 is in l2_1
- p1 is in l1_4
- p2 is in l1_4

1. `loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4`: p1 is now in t1.
2. `loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4`: p2 is now in t1.
3. `drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1`: t1 (with p1 and p2) is now in l1_5.
4. `unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5`: p2 is now in l1_5.
5. `drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1`: t1 (with p1) is now in l1_1.
6. `unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1`: p1 is now in l1_1.
7. `loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1`: p1 is now in a1.
8. `flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1`: a1 (with p1) is now in l2_1.
9. `unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1`: p1 is now in l2_1.
10. `drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2`: t2 is now in l2_1.
11. `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1`: p1 is now in t2.
12. `drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2`: t2 (with p1) is now in l2_5.
13. `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5`: p1 is now in l2_5.

End:
- p1 is in l2_5
- p2 is in l1_5

This satisfies the goal. The plan is valid.

I'm confident that our 13-step plan is optimal. It efficiently handles both packages and avoids unnecessary movements. The plan is:

```
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
```

Let me just carefully check if there are any further optimizations:

1. We could skip using a truck in city c2 and fly a1 directly to a location close to l2_5, but the problem specifies that airplanes can only move between airports, so this is not an option.
2. We could use a2 instead of a1 for part of the journey, but that doesn't seem more efficient. a1 is already in the right position to help p1 move from c1 to c2.
3. We could try different orders of handling p1 and p2, but since they both start in the same location and need to go to different locations, our approach of handling them together and then diverging seems efficient.

I'm confident that our 13-step plan is optimal for the given problem.
