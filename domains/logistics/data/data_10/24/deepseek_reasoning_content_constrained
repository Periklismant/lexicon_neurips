Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. Hmm, the goal is to get p1 to l2_5 and p2 to l1_5. But there are a bunch of constraints to satisfy. Let me start by understanding the initial state and the constraints.

First, the initial state: Both p1 and p2 are in l1_4. Trucks t1 is in l1_4, t2 in l2_4. Airplanes a1 in l1_1 (which is an airport in c1), a2 in l2_1 (airport in c2). So cities c1 and c2 each have multiple locations, including their airports.

The constraints are a bit complex. Let's list them out:

1. At some state, p2 must be in l1_5. And if that's true, there must be an earlier state where p2 was in l1_1.
2. At some state, p1 must be in a2.
3. At some state, p2 must be in a2 or a1.
4. At some state, p1 must be in l2_1. And if that's true, earlier there must be p2 in l2_4 or p1 in l1_3.
5. At some state, p1 is in l1_4. And if so, then p2 must be in l1_3 at or after that state.
6. At some state, p1 is in l1_1. And if so, then p2 must be in l1_1 or p1 in l2_3 at or after that.
7. At some state, p2 is in t2.
8. At some state, p2 is in t2 or p1 is in l2_4.
9. At some state, p2 is in l1_2.
10. At some state, p2 is in l2_2 or a2.

So, each of these must hold at least once. Also, the plan must be optimal (shortest possible). Let's try to map the steps.

First, moving p2 to l1_5. Since l1_5 is in c1, which is the same city as where p2 starts (l1_4). So maybe using truck t1. But how?

Wait, p2 starts in l1_4. To get to l1_5, maybe drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_5, but first load p2 into t1. Then unload there. But then, constraint 1 says that when p2 is in l1_5, there must be a prior state where p2 was in l1_1. So p2 has to go through l1_1 at some point. But l1_1 is an airport. So maybe p2 needs to be transported via airplane? But l1_1 is in c1. Wait, but the goal for p2 is l1_5, which is in c1. So why would p2 go to l1_1? That seems like a detour. But the constraint requires it. So even though it's in the same city, the constraint says that before p2 reaches l1_5, it must have been in l1_1.

So p2's path would be l1_4 -> ... -> l1_1 -> ... -> l1_5. But how? Since l1_1 is an airport. So maybe use a truck to move p2 to l1_1, then maybe another truck to l1_5? But why? That might not be optimal. Alternatively, maybe load p2 onto an airplane in l1_1, but since airplanes can only fly between airports. Wait, l1_1 is an airport, and l2_1 is another. So if p2 is loaded into a1 (which starts in l1_1), then fly to l2_1, but that's another city. But that might not help. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe p2 is moved via truck to l1_1, then loaded into an airplane, but since airplanes can only go to other airports. So if we need to get p2 from l1_1 to some other location in c1, but airplanes can't move within the same city. Wait, trucks can move within the same city. So perhaps the constraint is forcing p2 to go through l1_1 (airport) even though it's not necessary for the path. But the constraint says that when p2 is in l1_5 (the goal), there must have been a prior state where p2 was in l1_1. So the plan must include moving p2 to l1_1 at some point before it's delivered to l1_5.

So for p2: l1_4 → ... → l1_1 → ... → l1_5. How?

First, load p2 into t1 (since t1 is at l1_4). Then drive t1 to l1_1. But wait, are l1_4 and l1_1 in the same city? Yes, c1. So can a truck drive from l1_4 to l1_1? But the drive action requires that l_from and l_to are in the same city. So yes. Then, drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1. Then unload p2 there. But then, p2 is in l1_1. Then, maybe drive t1 again to l1_5. Then load p2, drive, unload. But that would involve two truck moves. But that would satisfy the constraint.

But also, the plan has to handle p1's movement to l2_5. Let's think about p1. p1 starts in l1_4. To get to l2_5 (in c2), which is a location in city c2. So the path would involve moving p1 to an airport in c1 (like l1_1), load into airplane a1, fly to l2_1 (airport in c2), then load into truck t2 (which is in l2_4? Wait, t2 is in l2_4 initially. So maybe drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1? No, because l2_4 and l2_1 are in c2. So drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2. Then unload, load p1 into t2, drive to l2_5, unload.

But let's check the constraints for p1:

- Must be in a2 at some state. So p1 needs to be loaded into a2. But a2 is in l2_1 initially. So to get p1 into a2, it needs to be in l2_1. So maybe after flying to l2_1 via a1, then transfer to a2? But why? Because the constraint says p1 must be in a2 at some point. So perhaps after p1 arrives at l2_1 via a1, load into a2 (but then a2 is in l2_1, so possible). Then unload from a2. But why would we do that? Because the constraint requires p1 to be in a2 at some point. So even if it's not necessary for the plan, we have to include that step.

But how? Let's outline steps for p1:

1. Move p1 from l1_4 to l1_1 (airport). Use truck t1. Load p1 into t1 at l1_4. Drive t1 to l1_1. Unload p1. Then load into a1. Fly a1 to l2_1. Unload p1 into l2_1. Then load into a2 (since a2 is in l2_1). Then, unload from a2 into l2_1 again. Then load into truck t2 (drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1), load p1, drive to l2_5, unload. But this seems complicated. Also, need to meet other constraints.

But let's check the constraints related to p1:

- Must be in l2_1 at some state. So when p1 is unloaded from a1 into l2_1, that's covered.

- If p1 is in l2_1, then earlier there must be p2 in l2_4 or p1 in l1_3. Let's see. When we load p1 into a1 at l1_1, that's after moving p1 from l1_4. To get to l1_1, we can drive via l1_3? Wait, l1_4 is in c1. The locations in c1 are l1_1, l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5. So maybe drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_3, then to l1_1. But that adds steps, which might not be optimal. Alternatively, if we drive directly from l1_4 to l1_1, then p1 is in l1_1. Then, loading into a1 and flying to l2_1. So when p1 is in l2_1, the prior state must have p2 in l2_4 (which is where t2 starts) or p1 in l1_3. But if we drive directly, p1 was never in l1_3. So to satisfy that constraint, before p1 arrives at l2_1, we need to have either p2 in l2_4 (which is initially true, since p2 starts in l1_4, but p2's initial location is l1_4, not l2_4. Wait, the initial state says "Package t2 is in location l2_4", but that's a typo. Wait, the user wrote:

Original state:

"Package t1 is in location l1_4"
"Package t2 is in location l2_4"
"Package p1 is in location l1_4"
"Package p2 is in location l1_4"
"Package a1 is in location l1_1"
"Package a2 is in location l2_1"

Wait, that's probably a mistake. The user probably meant "Truck t1 is in location l1_4", "Truck t2 is in location l2_4", "Airplane a1 is in l1_1", etc. Because "package t1" doesn't make sense. So assuming that's a typo, the initial state should have:

Truck t1 in l1_4,

Truck t2 in l2_4,

Airplane a1 in l1_1,

Airplane a2 in l2_1,

Packages p1 and p2 in l1_4.

So, the initial location of p2 is l1_4 (in c1), and t2 is in l2_4 (c2). So when moving p1 to l2_1, the constraint says that before that, either p2 is in l2_4 (but p2 is in l1_4 initially) or p1 is in l1_3. So unless we move p2 to l2_4, which is in another city, which requires airplanes, but that's a detour. Alternatively, move p1 through l1_3. So maybe drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_3, then to l1_1. Then fly to l2_1. That way, when p1 is in l2_1, the prior state would have p1 in l1_3, satisfying the constraint.

But that adds steps. So the plan for p1 would be:

loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1

unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3

drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1

loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (Wait, no, after moving t1 to l1_3, then to l1_1, but p1 is unloaded in l1_3. So to get p1 into l1_1, we need to load it again into the truck? Or maybe drive the truck empty to l1_3, load p1, drive to l1_1, unload. Hmm, but that complicates the steps. Alternatively, maybe the initial plan for p1 is:

Load p1 into t1 at l1_4.

Drive t1 to l1_3 (so p1 is in t1, which is now in l1_3).

Unload p1 in l1_3. (Now p1 is in l1_3, satisfying the condition for when p1 is in l2_1 later.)

Then load p1 again into t1, drive to l1_1, unload, load into a1, fly to l2_1.

But this adds more steps. But perhaps necessary to satisfy the constraint.

Alternatively, if we take the direct route: load p1 into t1, drive directly from l1_4 to l1_1. But then, when p1 is in l2_1, the prior state must have p2 in l2_4 (which is where t2 is, but p2 is in l1_4). So unless we move p2 to l2_4, which is in c2, which would require flying. But moving p2 to l2_4 would be a big detour. So maybe it's better to have p1 pass through l1_3.

So, let's consider that path for p1.

Now, let's consider all the constraints and see how each can be satisfied.

Constraint 3: p1 must be in a2 at some state. So after flying to l2_1 (via a1), we need to load p1 into a2. Then unload again. So maybe:

After a1 arrives at l2_1, unload p1. Then load p1 into a2 (which is at l2_1). Then, to get p1 to l2_5, we need to move it via truck. So unload from a2, load into t2, drive to l2_5.

But this adds steps. But necessary for the constraint.

Constraint 5: p1 must be in l1_4 at some state. The initial state has that, but if we move p1 out, then we need to have a state where p1 is again in l1_4. Wait, no. The initial state already has p1 in l1_4, so the first state (initial) satisfies that. But the constraint says "at least one state", which includes the initial state. So that's already satisfied. So we don't need to do anything extra for that. But there's another part: if p1 is in l1_4 in some state s, then p2 must be in l1_3 at s or after. Since the initial state has p1 in l1_4, then p2 must be in l1_3 at some point after. So we need to move p2 to l1_3 after the initial state.

So, perhaps after moving p1 out of l1_4 (like loading into t1 and driving away), we need to handle p2 to get it to l1_3.

But how? Let's think about p2's path.

p2 starts in l1_4. The goal is l1_5. But to satisfy the constraint, p2 must be in l1_1 before reaching l1_5. Also, the other constraints for p2 include:

- Must be in t2 at some state. But t2 is in c2's l2_4. So how can p2 get into t2? Since p2 starts in c1, it needs to be moved to c2. Which requires an airplane. So perhaps p2 is loaded into a1, flown to l2_1, then loaded into t2, then driven to l2_4 (but why?), but then how does it get back to c1? This seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps to satisfy the constraint that p2 must be in t2, we need to somehow get p2 into t2. But since t2 is in c2, and p2 starts in c1, this requires moving p2 between cities. Which would require using an airplane. So let's see:

Load p2 into t1 at l1_4.

Drive t1 to l1_1.

Unload p2.

Load p2 into a1.

Fly a1 to l2_1.

Unload p2 into l2_1.

Load p2 into t2 (but t2 is in l2_4. So need to drive t2 to l2_1 first. So:

Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.

Load p2 into t2.

Then drive t2 back to l2_4. But why? Maybe to satisfy the constraint that p2 is in t2. But this seems like a lot of steps. But perhaps necessary.

But then, after that, we need to get p2 back to c1 to reach l1_5. Which would require another airplane trip. This seems very involved. But perhaps necessary to meet the constraints.

Alternatively, maybe the constraints can be satisfied without moving p2 to c2. Let me check the constraints again.

Constraints for p2:

- Must be in l1_5 (goal).

- When p2 is in l1_5, must have been in l1_1 earlier.

- Must be in a2 or a1 at some state.

- Must be in t2 at some state.

- Must be in l1_2 at some state.

- Must be in l2_2 or a2 at some state.

Wait, the last constraint says that at some state, p2 is in l2_2 or a2. So p2 must be in c2's locations at some point. Which means p2 has to be transported to c2.

Similarly, the constraint that p2 must be in t2 (which is in c2) requires moving p2 to c2.

So, p2's journey must involve going to c2 and then back to c1.

So here's a possible path for p2:

1. l1_4 → (t1) → l1_1 → (a1) → l2_1 → (t2) → l2_2 → (a2) → l2_1 → (a1) → l1_1 → (t1) → l1_5.

But this is very long. Let's see if we can satisfy all constraints:

- Being in a2: when p2 is loaded into a2 at l2_1.

- Being in t2: when loaded into t2.

- Being in l2_2: when driven there by t2.

- Being in l1_1: when unloaded from a1.

- Being in l1_5: the goal.

But how to fit this into a plan without making it too long.

Alternatively, maybe some constraints can be met in overlapping steps. For example, when p2 is in a2, that satisfies both the "in a2" constraint and the "l2_2 or a2" constraint.

But let's proceed step by step.

First, handle p2's movement:

1. Load p2 into t1 at l1_4.

2. Drive t1 to l1_1 (so p2 is now in l1_1, satisfying the constraint that before l1_5, it was in l1_1).

3. Unload p2 into l1_1.

4. Load p2 into a1.

5. Fly a1 to l2_1.

6. Unload p2 into l2_1.

7. Load p2 into a2 (since a2 is at l2_1, this meets the constraint that p2 is in a2).

8. Fly a2 to l2_2? Wait, but l2_2 is not an airport. Airplanes can only fly between airports. So l2_1 is the only airport in c2. So no, can't fly to l2_2. So to get p2 to l2_2, need to use a truck. So:

7. After unloading p2 into l2_1, load into t2. But first, drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.

So:

Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.

Load p2 into t2 (satisfies "p2 in t2" constraint).

Drive t2 to l2_2.

Unload p2 into l2_2 (satisfies the "l2_2 or a2" constraint).

Then, to get p2 back to c1, we need to load into airplane again. So:

Load p2 into a2 (if a2 is at l2_1, but after flying, where is a2? Wait, a2 starts at l2_1. If we fly a2 to l1_1 (assuming airports are connected?), but the flyairplane action allows flying between any airports. So a2 can fly from l2_1 to l1_1 (airport to airport). So:

Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.

Unload p2 into l1_1.

Then load into t1 again, drive to l1_5.

But this is getting very complicated. Let's count the steps for p2:

- Load into t1, drive to l1_1, unload. (3 actions)

- Load into a1, fly to l2_1, unload. (3 actions)

- Drive t2 to l2_1 (1 action)

- Load into t2, drive to l2_2, unload. (3 actions)

- Load into a2, fly to l1_1, unload. (3 actions)

- Load into t1, drive to l1_5, unload. (3 actions)

That's 16 actions just for p2, not counting p1's steps. Plus any steps for p1. This can't be optimal. There must be a smarter way.

Alternatively, perhaps some constraints can be satisfied in parallel with the main goals. Let's look at all constraints again:

Constraints:

1. p2 in l1_5 requires prior p2 in l1_1.

2. p1 must be in a2.

3. p2 must be in a1 or a2.

4. p1 in l2_1 requires prior p2 in l2_4 or p1 in l1_3.

5. p1 in l1_4 (already true initially, but after that, p2 must be in l1_3 at or after.

6. p1 in l1_1 requires p2 in l1_1 or p1 in l2_3 at or after.

7. p2 in t2.

8. p2 in t2 or p1 in l2_4.

9. p2 in l1_2.

10. p2 in l2_2 or a2.

So, for constraint 5: since p1 starts in l1_4, but once we move p1 out, the constraint requires that p2 must be in l1_3 at or after. So we need to move p2 to l1_3 after moving p1 out.

But p2 is initially in l1_4. So perhaps after moving p1 out (say, load into t1 and drive to l1_3), unload p1 there. Then, move p2 to l1_3. Wait, but p2 is in l1_4. So maybe load p2 into t1, drive to l1_3, unload. That would put p2 in l1_3, satisfying the constraint when p1 is in l1_4 (initial state) then p2 must be in l1_3 after.

But the initial state is s0. So in s0, p1 is in l1_4. Then, the first action is loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4. Now, p1 is in t1. Then drive to l1_3. Now, p1 is in l1_3. So after s0, we have actions that move p1. So constraint 5 says that if p1 is in l1_4 in some state s, then p2 must be in l1_3 at s or after. Since s0 is the initial state, and p1 is in l1_4, then p2 must be in l1_3 at some state after s0. So moving p2 to l1_3 after s0 would satisfy that.

So perhaps, after moving p1 to l1_3, we can move p2 to l1_3 as well. But how? Let's see:

Action 1: loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

Action 2: drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1

Action 3: unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3

Now p1 is in l1_3. Then, for p2:

Action 4: loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (but t1 is now in l1_3. Wait, t1 was driven to l1_3. So t1 is in l1_3. p2 is in l1_4. So can't load p2 into t1 unless t1 is in l1_4. So we need to drive t1 back to l1_4. But that would take time.

So:

Action 4: drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1

Action 5: loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

Action 6: drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1

Action 7: unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

Now p2 is in l1_3. This satisfies constraint 5. But these are 7 actions already, and we haven't even started on the main goals.

This seems inefficient. Maybe there's a better way. For example, use a different truck or airplane. Wait, the trucks available are t1 in c1 and t2 in c2. So for c1, only t1 can be used. So to move p2 from l1_4 to l1_3, need to use t1.

But if p1 is being moved via t1 to l1_3, then after unloading p1, t1 can go back to l1_4 to pick up p2.

So steps:

1. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1

3. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 → p1 in l1_3

4. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1 → t1 back to l1_4

5. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

6. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1

7. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 → p2 in l1_3

Now, constraint 5 is satisfied because after s0 (p1 in l1_4), p2 is moved to l1_3.

Then, proceed to move p1 and p2 towards their goals.

But this adds several steps. Let's see if this is necessary.

Alternatively, maybe we can find a way to have p2 reach l1_3 without using t1 twice. For example, if p2 is moved to l1_3 before moving p1. But since both start in l1_4, perhaps:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1

3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

Now p2 is in l1_3. Then proceed to move p1.

But then, when moving p1, you need to use t1, which is now in l1_3. So:

4. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4 → wait, t1 is in l1_3 now. Can't load p1 from l1_4 unless t1 is there. So this approach isn't possible.

So, perhaps the steps I outlined before are necessary.

Now, considering all the constraints and steps needed, this is getting quite complex. Let's try to outline a possible plan, considering all constraints.

Plan for p1:

- Move from l1_4 to l1_3 (via t1), then to l1_1 (via t1), load into a1, fly to l2_1, load into a2 (to satisfy constraint 2), then load into t2, drive to l2_5.

Plan for p2:

- Move from l1_4 to l1_3 (via t1), then to l1_1 (via t1), load into a1, fly to l2_1, load into t2, drive to l2_2 (satisfy constraint 10), then load into a2 (satisfy constraint 3 and 10), fly back to l1_1, then drive to l1_5.

But this is very long. Let's see if we can interleave actions to optimize.

Another approach: since both packages start in l1_4, use t1 to move them to l1_1, then use airplanes to move them to c2, handle the constraints there, then move p2 back.

But let's try to outline a step-by-step plan:

1. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1 → p1 in t1 at l1_3

3. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 → p1 in l1_3 (satisfies constraint 4's condition when p1 is later in l2_1)

4. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1 → t1 back to l1_4

5. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

6. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1 → p2 in t1 at l1_3

7. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 → p2 in l1_3 (satisfies constraint 5)

8. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1 → t1 to l1_1

9. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 → p1 is in l1_1 (need to check if t1 is there. Yes, step 8)

Wait, after step 8, t1 is in l1_1. But p1 is in l1_3. So to load p1 into t1 at l1_1, p1 needs to be there. So steps 3 leaves p1 in l1_3. So need to move p1 to l1_1.

Alternative approach: After step 3, p1 is in l1_3. To get to l1_1, need to load into t1 again.

So:

After step 3, t1 is in l1_3. Then:

4. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3

5. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1

6. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 → p1 in l1_1

7. Now, load p1 into a1.

8. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 → a1 arrives at l2_1.

9. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 → p1 in l2_1 (satisfies constraint 4)

10. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 → p1 in a2 (satisfies constraint 2)

11. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l2_1 → no, need to fly to another airport. But a2 is already in l2_1. To fly somewhere else, like back to l1_1? But why?

Alternatively, unload p1 from a2 into l2_1 again.

12. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 → p1 in l2_1.

Then load into t2, drive to l2_5.

13. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2 → t2 comes to l2_1.

14. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

15. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2

16. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 → p1 at goal.

Now, for p2:

After step 7, p2 is in l1_3 (from step 7).

But need to get p2 to l1_5 via l1_1.

So:

17. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (t1 is in l1_1 after step 5? Wait, no. After step 5, t1 was driven to l1_1 and unloaded. So after step 6, t1 is in l1_1. To load p2 from l1_3 into t1, t1 must be there. So need to drive t1 back to l1_3.

But this is getting too complicated. Maybe we need to handle p2's movement after step 7.

After step 7, p2 is in l1_3. t1 is in l1_1 (from step 5). To move p2 to l1_1:

8. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1 → t1 to l1_3.

9. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

10. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1

11. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 → p2 in l1_1 (satisfies constraint 1's precondition for p2 in l1_5)

12. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

13. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

14. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 → p2 in l2_1

15. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2

16. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 → p2 in t2 (satisfies constraint 7)

17. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2

18. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 → p2 in l2_2 (satisfies constraint 10)

19. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 → but p2 is in l2_2. So need to drive t2 back to l2_1.

Wait, after step 18, p2 is in l2_2. To load into a2, which is in l2_1. So:

19. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 → t2 back to l2_1.

20. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 → wait, p2 is in l2_2. Unloaded in step 18. So to get p2 back, need to load it into t2 again.

But p2 is in l2_2. So:

19. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

20. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2

21. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 → p2 in l2_1.

22. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 → now p2 is in a2 (satisfies constraint 3 and 10)

23. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

24. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 → p2 in l1_1.

25. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

26. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1

27. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 → p2 at goal.

This is extremely long, but covers all the constraints. However, the problem requires an optimal plan (shortest possible). This approach has 27 steps, which is likely not optimal.

Let's see if we can find a shorter plan that still satisfies all constraints.

Alternative approach for p2: After moving p2 to l1_1 (via truck), instead of flying to c2, maybe fly to l2_1, but then use a2 to fly back. But perhaps there's a way to satisfy multiple constraints with fewer steps.

For example, constraint 10 requires p2 to be in l2_2 or a2. If p2 is loaded into a2, that satisfies both constraint 3 and 10. So perhaps loading p2 into a2 once is sufficient.

Similarly, constraint 7 requires p2 to be in t2. So, once p2 is loaded into t2, that's satisfied.

So let's try to find a path for p2 that goes to t2 and a2, and then back to c1.

But how?

Plan outline for p2:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1

3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 → satisfies constraint 1's precondition

4. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

6. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

7. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2 → bring t2 to l2_1

8. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 → p2 in t2 (constraint 7)

9. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2 → p2 in l2_2 (constraint 10)

10. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

11. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 → back to l2_1

12. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

13. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 → p2 in a2 (constraint 3 and 10)

14. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

15. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

16. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

17. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1

18. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 → goal.

This is 18 actions for p2, plus steps for p1.

For p1:

1. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1 → p1 in l1_3 (constraint 4's condition)

3. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3

4. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1 → t1 to l1_1

5. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 → p1 in t1 at l1_1

6. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 → p1 in l1_1 (constraint 6: p1 in l1_1, so need p2 in l1_1 or p1 in l2_3 after. But p2 is moved to l1_1 later, so maybe this can be satisfied)

7. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

8. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

9. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 → p1 in l2_1 (constraint 4: requires prior p2 in l2_4 or p1 in l1_3. p1 was in l1_3 in step 3, which is before this. So satisfied.)

10. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 → p1 in a2 (constraint 2)

11. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 → not necessary, but maybe to unload.

Alternatively, after step 10, unload p1 from a2 into l2_1:

11. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 → p1 in l2_1

12. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (t2 is there after step 7)

13. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2

14. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 → goal.

This adds 14 steps for p1. Combining both, total steps would be 18 + 14 = 32, but overlapping steps may allow for some actions to be merged.

But this is still very long. Let's try to see if any steps can be combined or optimized.

For example, when moving p2 to l2_1 via a1, p1 can be on the same airplane. But since we have two packages, maybe they can share some steps.

Wait, but the problem requires both packages to be moved, so their steps might need to be interleaved.

Alternatively, perhaps some actions can be done in parallel. For example, after p1 is loaded into a1 and flown to l2_1, then both p1 and p2 can be handled in c2.

But given the constraints, it's challenging to find a shorter path.

Another observation: constraint 8 says that at some state, p2 is in t2 or p1 is in l2_4. Since p1's goal is l2_5 in c2, maybe p1 passes through l2_4. So if p1 is in l2_4 at some point, that satisfies constraint 8. But l2_4 is where t2 starts. So if p1 is loaded into t2 in l2_4, but that requires moving p1 to l2_4.

Alternatively, when p1 arrives in l2_1, to get to l2_5, it's loaded into t2 which is in l2_4. So drive t2 to l2_1, load p1, drive to l2_5. So p1 would be in l2_4 when t2 is driven back? Not sure.

Alternatively, if p1 is in l2_4 during transport, that could satisfy constraint 8. For example, if t2 is driven from l2_4 to l2_1, then p1 is loaded there, and driven to l2_5. So p1 is never in l2_4. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps constraint 8 is satisfied by p2 being in t2, which is handled when p2 is loaded into t2.

So, maybe constraint 8 is satisfied when p2 is in t2 (step 8 of p2's plan), so no need for p1 to be in l2_4.

This would reduce the need for certain steps.

But this is getting too involved. Given the time constraints, perhaps the optimal plan is as follows, ensuring all constraints are met with the least steps:

```

loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

```

But this is 28 steps, which is not optimal. I must have missed a smarter way to handle this.

Wait, maybe after moving p1 to l2_1 via a1, load into a2 to satisfy the constraint, then unload and load into t2. For p2, after moving to l2_1, load into t2 and drive to l2_2, then back to l2_1, load into a2, fly back, and then to l1_5.

But perhaps there's a way to have p2's journey to l2_2 and a2 in fewer steps.

Alternatively, when p2 is in l2_1 after being flown there, load into a2 directly (satisfying constraint 3 and 10), then fly back to l1_1, thus satisfying the need to be in a2 and l1_1.

But this would be:

For p2:

loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1

unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (now in a2)

flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1

unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

This is 12 actions for p2. Let's check constraints:

- p2 in l1_5 with prior l1_1: yes.

- p2 in a2: yes.

- p2 in t2: no. So need to have p2 in t2 at some point.

Ah, right, constraint 7 requires p2 in t2. So we need to load p2 into t2. So between steps 6 and 7:

After unload p2 in l2_1:

loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (t2 needs to be there. So drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1 first.

So:

drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2

loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2

unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

Then proceed to load into a2.

This adds steps, but satisfies constraint 7 and 10.

So integrating this:

For p2:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1

3. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

4. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

6. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

7. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2

8. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

9. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2

10. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

11. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

12. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

13. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

14. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

15. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1

16. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

This is 16 steps for p2, and p1's steps would be:

1. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

2. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1

3. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3

4. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1

5. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

6. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

7. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

8. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

9. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

10. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

11. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

12. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

13. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2

14. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

Total steps for p1: 14.

Combined, but some steps can be interleaved. For example, steps for p1 and p2 can be done in parallel where possible. Like after p2 is loaded into a1 (step 4), p1 can be loaded into a1 as well, but since they're separate packages, maybe not. Alternatively, using different airplanes.

But airplanes can only carry one package at a time unless the domain allows multiple loads. But the actions are per package, so each package needs to be loaded separately.

Given the complexity, perhaps the optimal plan is around 20 steps. But without a clear way to minimize further, I'll proceed with a plan that satisfies all constraints with the fewest steps possible, interleaving actions where possible.
