Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. First, I need to understand the initial state and the goal. The goal is to have p1 in l2_4 and p2 in l1_2. Let's look at the initial positions.

Initial state:
- p1 is in l1_5 (city c1)
- p2 is in l1_1 (which is an airport in c1)
- Trucks t1 is in l1_2, t2 in l2_4
- Airplanes a1 is in l1_1, a2 in l2_1

So, p1 needs to go from l1_5 (c1) to l2_4 (c2). Since cities are connected by airplanes (which move between airports), p1 needs to be transported to an airport in c1, flown to c2's airport, then moved via truck to l2_4. But t2 is already in l2_4, so maybe we can use t2 to unload p1 there.

Wait, t2 is in l2_4 (city c2), right? So if p1 gets to l2_1 (airport of c2), then we can drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1, load p1 into t2, then drive back? Wait, no. Wait, t2 is in l2_4 initially. So to get t2 to l2_1 (the airport), we can drive it from l2_4 to l2_1, but cities have locations. Let's see:

Locations in c2: l2_1 (airport), l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5. So t2 starts at l2_4. To get to l2_1, we can drive it through the city. So drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2, then l2_3 to l2_2, then to l2_1? But maybe there's a direct path if the cities allow moving between any locations. Wait, the drive action allows moving from any l_from to l_to in the same city. So maybe we can drive directly from l2_4 to l2_1 if they're in the same city. Wait, but the drivetruck action's precondition says that l_from and l_to are locations in city c. So as long as both are in c2, yes. So t2 can drive from l2_4 to l2_1 directly.

So for p1's journey: from l1_5, need to get to l2_4. So steps could be: load p1 into a truck in c1, drive to airport l1_1, load into airplane a1, fly to l2_1, unload into a2 maybe? Wait, the airplanes are a1 in l1_1 and a2 in l2_1. So to fly from c1 to c2, use a1 to fly to l2_1. Then unload p1 into l2_1, load into t2 (after driving t2 to l2_1), then drive t2 back to l2_4 and unload.

But let's check the constraints. There are several constraints that must be satisfied. Let's list them:

Constraints:

1. At least once, p2 is in l1_4.
2. At least once, p2 is in l1_2 (which is part of the goal).
3. If p2 is in l1_2 in some state, there must be an earlier state where p2 is in l1_4 or p1 is in l1_4.
4. At least once, p1 is in l1_5 (which is its initial position, so that's already true, but maybe needs to be in a later state? Wait, the initial state has p1 in l1_5, but the constraints need to hold in at least one state. So unless the initial state counts, we might need to have p1 back in l1_5 again. Wait, the problem says "valid plan must abide by the following constraints". So the initial state is part of the states. So the constraint "p1 is in l1_5" is already satisfied in the initial state. So maybe that's already okay. But if the problem requires it to hold in the plan's states (including the initial?), then maybe we don't need to do anything. Hmm, but perhaps the plan's actions might move p1 away and then back. But the constraint is that "in at least one state", which could be the initial. So maybe that's already satisfied. Wait, but the user says "the original state of the world is the following", and the constraints are part of the problem. So maybe the initial state is considered part of the plan's states. So constraint 4 is already satisfied. But need to confirm.

Then constraint 5: If p1 is in l1_5 in some state s, then either p2 is in l2_3 or l1_4 in s or after.

Since the initial state has p1 in l1_5, then this condition must hold in the initial state or after. But in the initial state, p2 is in l1_1, which is not l2_3 or l1_4. So this constraint is not satisfied by the initial state. Therefore, whenever p1 is in l1_5 (which is initial and maybe again later), we need to ensure that either p2 is in l2_3 or l1_4 at that state or later. So if p1 is moved away from l1_5 and then back, we have to check again.

But perhaps this constraint is only triggered if p1 is in l1_5 in some state during the plan. Since the initial state is part of the plan's states, we need to make sure that either in the initial state or after, p2 is in l2_3 or l1_4. But the initial state doesn't have p2 in those locations, so we need to ensure that after the initial state, there's a state where p2 is in l2_3 or l1_4. But wait, the constraint says "if in some state s, p1 is in l1_5, then in s or some state after s, p2 must be in l2_3 or l1_4." So the initial state s0 has p1 in l1_5, so we must have that either in s0, p2 is in l2_3 or l1_4 (which it isn't) or in some state after s0, p2 is in those locations. Therefore, during the plan, p2 must be moved to l2_3 or l1_4 at some point after the initial state.

But let's check other constraints.

Constraint 6: At least once, either p1 is in a2 or in l1_2. The goal requires p2 to be in l1_2, but p1's goal is l2_4. So maybe during the plan, p1 is in a2 (airplane in l2_1), which is possible if p1 is loaded into a2. But a2 starts in l2_1. To get p1 into a2, we need to fly a2 to l1_1, but that's impossible because airplanes can only fly between airports. Wait, no. Airplanes can fly between any airports. So if a2 is in l2_1, can it fly to l1_1 (another airport)? Yes. So maybe a2 can fly to l1_1, then p1 is loaded into a2 there. But why would we do that? Because maybe p1 needs to be in a2 for one of the constraints. Let's see constraint 12: p2 must be in a2 at some state. So p2 is initially in l1_1. So to get p2 into a2, which is in l2_1, we need to transport p2 to l2_1 and load into a2. But a2 is in l2_1 initially. So perhaps we need to move p2 to l2_1 and load into a2. But how? Since p2 starts in l1_1 (airport of c1), we can load it into a1 (which is in l1_1), fly a1 to l2_1, unload p2, then load into a2. But that's a possible way.

But let's try to map out all constraints first.

Constraints:

7. p2 must be in l1_3 at some state.

8. p1 must be in l2_1 at some state. So during the plan, p1 needs to be in l2_1, which is the airport of c2. Since p1's goal is l2_4, which is in c2, maybe this happens when p1 is unloaded from an airplane at l2_1.

9. If p1 is in l2_1 in some state, then in an earlier state, p1 was in l1_2. So p1 must be moved to l1_2 before being in l2_1. But initially, p1 is in l1_5. So how to get p1 to l1_2? Load into a truck in c1, drive to l1_2, then unload. Then perhaps move to the airport.

Constraint 10: At least once, p2 is in l2_1 or p1 is in l1_3. So if p2 is moved to l2_1 (as part of getting into a2 for constraint 12), that would satisfy this. Alternatively, p1 is in l1_3.

Constraint 11: At least once, p2 is in a1 or p1 is in l1_2. Since p1's goal is l2_4, but l1_2 is part of c1. So perhaps p1 is loaded into a truck and moved to l1_2. But why? Unless it's needed for some constraint. But maybe during transportation, but let's see.

Constraint 12: p2 must be in a2 at some state.

Constraint 13: At least once, p1 is in l1_3 and p2 is in a2.

So, putting all this together:

First, let's handle the constraints that involve p2, as they might require more steps.

Constraints involving p2:

- Must be in l1_4 (constraint 1)
- Must be in l1_2 (goal)
- When p2 is in l1_2, there must be an earlier state where p2 is in l1_4 or p1 is in l1_4 (constraint 3)
- Must be in l1_3 (constraint 7)
- Must be in a2 (constraint 12)
- Must be in l2_1 or p1 in l1_3 (constraint 10)
- At least once, either p2 is in a1 or p1 in l1_2 (constraint 11)
- At least once, p1 in l1_3 and p2 in a2 (constraint 13)

So for p2:

- Start in l1_1 (airport in c1)
- Need to move to l1_4 (constraint 1)
- Then to l1_2 (goal)
- Also, need to get to l1_3 (constraint 7)
- Need to be in a2 (constraint 12)
- Need to be in a1 or p1 in l1_2 (constraint 11)
- Also, when p2 is in l1_2 (goal), there must have been an earlier state where p2 was in l1_4 or p1 was in l1_4 (constraint 3). Since constraint 1 requires p2 to be in l1_4 at least once, we can use that.

So steps for p2:

1. Move p2 from l1_1 to some location. Maybe load into a truck, drive to l1_4, unload (satisfy constraint 1).
2. Then move p2 to l1_3 (satisfy constraint 7).
3. Then move p2 to l1_2 (goal), but before that, ensure that either p2 was in l1_4 (which it was) or p1 is in l1_4. But since we already have p2 in l1_4, that's okay.
4. Also, need to get p2 into a2 (constraint 12). So p2 needs to be loaded into a2. But a2 is in l2_1 (c2's airport). So to load p2 into a2, we need to transport p2 to l2_1. How?

Wait, p2 is in l1_1 (c1's airport). So perhaps load p2 into a1 (which is already in l1_1), fly a1 to l2_1, unload p2 into l2_1, then load into a2. Then, unload into l2_1 again? But a2 is in l2_1. So:

- loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (since both are there)
- flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
- unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (now p2 is in l2_1)
- loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (since a2 is there)
- then unloadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (so p2 is back in l2_1). But that might not be necessary unless needed for another constraint.

But constraint 12 requires p2 to be in a2 at some state. So loading p2 into a2 and keeping it there for that step would satisfy it. Then, later, we can unload it. But if we need to get p2 back to l1_2, which is in c1, how?

Wait, the goal is for p2 to be in l1_2 (c1). So after moving p2 to l2_1 and into a2, we need to bring it back. But that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to transport p2 from l1_1 to l1_4, then to l1_3, then to l1_2, and also to get it into a2.

Alternatively, maybe p2 can be transported via airplane to c2 and back. But that's time-consuming.

Alternatively, perhaps we can load p2 into a1 in l1_1, fly to l2_1, unload, load into a2 (satisfies constraint 12), then fly a2 back to l1_1 (but airplanes can't fly to non-airports, so l1_1 is an airport). Wait, l1_1 is an airport, so a2 can fly there. So steps:

- loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
- fly a1 to l2_1
- unload p2 in l2_1
- load p2 into a2 in l2_1 (now p2 is in a2, satisfying constraint 12)
- fly a2 to l1_1
- unload p2 into l1_1
- then move p2 via truck to l1_4, l1_3, and finally to l1_2.

But this would require several steps, but perhaps it's necessary.

But let's also consider the constraints for p1.

For p1:

- Goal is l2_4 (in c2)
- Must be in l2_1 at some state (constraint 8)
- When p1 is in l2_1, there must be an earlier state where p1 was in l1_2 (constraint 9)
- Also, must be in l1_5 in some state (constraint 4, which is already satisfied initially)
- When p1 is in l1_5 (like initial state), then in that state or after, p2 must be in l2_3 or l1_4 (constraint 5). Since initially p2 is not, we need to move p2 to one of those locations later.
- Also, constraint 6 requires that p1 is in a2 or l1_2. If we move p1 to l1_2 (to satisfy constraint 9 for when it's in l2_1), then that could also satisfy constraint 6.
- Constraint 10: p2 in l2_1 or p1 in l1_3. If we have p2 in l2_1 (as part of getting into a2), that's covered.
- Constraint 13: p1 in l1_3 and p2 in a2. So p1 needs to be in l1_3 at some point, and during that time or another, p2 is in a2.

So steps for p1:

1. Start in l1_5. Need to get to l1_2 (to satisfy constraint 9 when p1 is later in l2_1). So load into truck t1 (which is in l1_2? Wait, initial state: "Package t1 is in location l1_2". Wait, no. Wait, the original state says "Package t1 is in location l1_2". Wait, t1 is a truck. So the truck t1 is in l1_2. So to load p1 into t1, we need to get t1 to l1_5. But t1 can drive within c1. So drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_5. Then load p1 into t1. Then drive t1 back to l1_2, unload p1. That would put p1 in l1_2, satisfying constraint 6 (p1 in l1_2) and also allowing constraint 9 (since later when p1 is in l2_1, there was an earlier state where p1 was in l1_2).

But why would we need to move p1 to l1_2? Because constraint 9 says that if p1 is in l2_1, it must have been in l1_2 earlier. So we need to have p1 in l1_2 before it's in l2_1.

Once p1 is in l1_2, how to get to l2_1? Since l2_1 is in c2's airport, need to fly. So:

After p1 is in l1_2, load it into a truck (t1) if needed. Wait, but to get to the airport l1_1, need to drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1. Then unload p1 into l1_1. Then load into airplane a1, fly to l2_1. Then unload into l2_1, which satisfies constraint 8 (p1 in l2_1). Then load into truck t2 (which is in l2_4; but need to drive t2 to l2_1 first). So drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1, load p1, drive back to l2_4, unload.

So putting this together:

For p1:

- Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_5 (to pick up p1)
- Load p1 into t1 at l1_5
- Drive t1 to l1_2
- Unload p1 into l1_2 (now p1 is in l1_2, satisfying constraint 6 and setting up for constraint 9)
- Then drive t1 to l1_1 (airport)
- Unload p1 into l1_1
- Load p1 into a1 at l1_1
- Fly a1 to l2_1
- Unload p1 into l2_1 (now p1 is in l2_1, satisfying constraint 8)
- Now, drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1 (since t2 is in l2_4)
- Load p1 into t2 at l2_1
- Drive t2 back to l2_4
- Unload p1 into l2_4 (goal)

But need to check constraints during these steps.

Now, let's consider the constraints and ensure they are all met.

Constraint 1: p2 in l1_4. We need to move p2 there. How?

p2 starts in l1_1. We need to move it to l1_4. Since l1_1 is in c1, can we load into a truck and drive?

But to do that, we need a truck in l1_1. The initial trucks are t1 in l1_2 and t2 in l2_4. So t1 is in c1. So drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1, load p2 into t1, drive to l1_4, unload. Then later move p2 from l1_4 to l1_3 and then to l1_2.

But that's additional steps for p2.

Let's outline p2's steps:

- Load p2 into t1 (after driving t1 to l1_1)
- Drive t1 to l1_4, unload (satisfy constraint 1)
- Then drive t1 to l1_3, unload (satisfy constraint 7)
- Then drive t1 to l1_2, unload (goal)

But how does p2 get from l1_1 to the truck? Since initially, p2 is in l1_1. To load into a truck, the truck must be in l1_1. So drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1, load p2, drive to l1_4, unload. Then drive to l1_3, unload. Then drive to l1_2, unload.

But this would require multiple steps for t1, which is also needed for moving p1. So need to manage the trucks' movements.

This is getting complex. Let's try to outline the steps for both packages, considering all constraints.

Possible plan outline:

1. Move p1 from l1_5 to l1_2 using t1.
   - Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_5 (drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_5 c1)
   - Load p1 into t1 (loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5)
   - Drive t1 to l1_2 (drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_2 c1)
   - Unload p1 in l1_2 (unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2)
   Now p1 is in l1_2 (satisfies constraint 6 and 9's condition)

2. Move p2 from l1_1 to l1_4 using t1.
   - Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1 (drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1)
   - Load p2 into t1 (loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1)
   - Drive t1 to l1_4 (drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1)
   - Unload p2 in l1_4 (unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4)
   Now p2 is in l1_4 (satisfies constraint 1)

3. Move p2 from l1_4 to l1_3.
   - Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_3 (drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1)
   - Load p2 into t1 (if it's still in l1_4? Wait, after step 2, p2 is in l1_4. So to move it to l1_3:
   - Load p2 into t1 (loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4)
   - Drive to l1_3 (drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1)
   - Unload p2 (unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3)
   Now p2 is in l1_3 (satisfies constraint 7)

4. Move p2 from l1_3 to l1_2.
   - Drive t1 to l1_3 to l1_2 (drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1)
   - Load p2 into t1 (if it's in l1_3)
   - Unload in l1_2 (unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2)
   But this would put p2 in l1_2, which is the goal. But we also need to satisfy constraint 3: when p2 is in l1_2, there must be an earlier state where p2 was in l1_4 or p1 in l1_4. We already have p2 in l1_4 in step 2, so that's satisfied.

5. Now, p1 needs to get to l2_4. Steps for p1:

   - Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1 (airport)
   - Load p1 into t1 at l1_2, then drive to l1_1 and unload? Or p1 is already in l1_2.

   Wait, after step 1, p1 is in l1_2. So to move p1 to the airport l1_1:

   - Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1 (drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1)
   - Load p1 into t1 (but p1 is in l1_2, so t1 is in l1_1. Wait, no. To load p1 into t1, t1 needs to be in the same location as p1. So if p1 is in l1_2, t1 must be there to load it. But after step 4, t1 is in l1_2 (after moving p2 there). Wait, after step 4, t1 is in l1_2 (after driving from l1_3 to l1_2). So p1 is in l1_2 (unloaded there in step 1). So:

   - Load p1 into t1 at l1_2 (loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2)
   - Drive t1 to l1_1 (drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1)
   - Unload p1 in l1_1 (unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1)
   Now p1 is in l1_1, which is the airport.

   Then load p1 into airplane a1 (which is in l1_1) (loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1)
   Fly a1 to l2_1 (flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1)
   Unload p1 into l2_1 (unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1)
   Now p1 is in l2_1 (satisfies constraint 8). Also, since p1 was in l1_2 earlier (step 1), constraint 9 is satisfied.

   Now, to get p1 to l2_4, need to load into t2, which is in l2_4. So drive t2 to l2_1:

   - Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1 (drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2)
   - Load p1 into t2 (loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1)
   - Drive t2 back to l2_4 (drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2)
   - Unload p1 (unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4) - goal achieved.

6. Now, handling p2's constraints: need to get p2 into a2 (constraint 12). Currently, p2 is in l1_2 (goal), but we need to have a state where p2 is in a2. So after moving p2 to l1_2, we need to move it again. But the goal requires p2 to be in l1_2. So this is a problem. We can't have p2 in a2 after the final state. So perhaps we need to temporarily move p2 to a2 and then back to l1_2.

But how? Because the goal is to have p2 in l1_2, but during the plan, we need to have p2 in a2.

So steps for p2 after being in l1_2 (step 4):

   - Load p2 into t1 (which is in l1_2)
   - Drive t1 to l1_1 (airport)
   - Unload p2 into l1_1
   - Load p2 into a1 (loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1)
   - Fly a1 to l2_1 (flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1)
   - Unload p2 into l2_1 (unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1)
   - Load p2 into a2 (loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1) → now p2 is in a2 (satisfies constraint 12)
   - Then fly a2 back to l1_1 (flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1)
   - Unload p2 into l1_1 (unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1)
   - Drive t1 to l1_1 to l1_2 (drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1)
   - Load p2 into t1 and unload in l1_2.

But this adds many steps. However, this allows p2 to be in a2 (satisfying constraint 12), and then back to l1_2 for the goal.

But this seems complicated. Let's check if there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, after step 4 (p2 in l1_2), maybe we can load p2 into a1 from l1_2. But a1 is in l1_1. So we need to move p2 to l1_1 first.

So:

   - Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1 with p2 loaded.
   - Unload p2 in l1_1.
   - Load into a1, fly to l2_1, unload, load into a2.
   Then fly a2 back to l1_1, unload, and drive back to l1_2.

This way, during the plan, p2 is in a2, satisfying constraint 12.

But this requires multiple steps. Let's outline these steps:

7. After step 4 (p2 in l1_2):

   - Load p2 into t1 at l1_2 (loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2)
   - Drive t1 to l1_1 (drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1)
   - Unload p2 in l1_1 (unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1)
   - Load p2 into a1 (loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1)
   - Fly a1 to l2_1 (flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1)
   - Unload p2 into l2_1 (unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1)
   - Load p2 into a2 (loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1) → p2 is now in a2 (constraint 12)
   - Now, fly a2 back to l1_1 (flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1)
   - Unload p2 into l1_1 (unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1)
   - Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_2 (drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1)
   - Load p2 into t1 (loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1)
   - Drive to l1_2 and unload (but wait, t1 is in l1_2 after step 7.3? Let me check:

   After step 7.2, t1 is in l1_1. Then in step 7.3, unload p2 in l1_1. Then in step 7.10, drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_2. Then load p2 into t1 (but p2 is in l1_1, so t1 needs to be in l1_1 to load. Wait, this is getting messy.

   Alternatively, after unloading p2 in l1_1 (step 7.3), then drive t1 back to l1_2 (step 7.10). Then, to load p2 into t1 again, t1 would need to be in l1_1. So perhaps this approach isn't working. Maybe we need to use another truck.

   But the only trucks in c1 are t1. t2 is in c2. So we can't use another truck in c1.

   So alternative approach: after p2 is unloaded in l1_1 (step 7.3), load into t1 (which is in l1_1), then drive to l1_2 and unload.

   So steps:

   - After step 7.3 (p2 in l1_1, t1 in l1_1):
   - Load p2 into t1 (loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1)
   - Drive t1 to l1_2 (drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1)
   - Unload p2 in l1_2 (unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2) → back to goal state.

But this would require that after loading p2 into a2 and flying back, we have to move p2 back to l1_2. However, this adds several steps but ensures that the final state is correct.

But this may not be optimal. Let's see if there's a way to combine steps.

Also, constraint 13 requires that p1 is in l1_3 and p2 is in a2. So we need to have p1 in l1_3 at some point. But according to the current plan, p1 is moved from l1_2 to l1_1, then to l2_1. So how to get p1 to l1_3?

This suggests that the current plan misses this constraint. So we need to adjust the plan to include p1 being in l1_3.

Hmm. This is getting very complicated. Let's re-express all constraints and check which ones are not yet covered:

Constraints:

1. p2 in l1_4 → covered in step 2.
2. p2 in l1_2 → covered in step 4.
3. If p2 in l1_2, then earlier p2 in l1_4 → covered.
4. p1 in l1_5 → initial state.
5. If p1 in l1_5 (initial), then after, p2 in l2_3 or l1_4 → after initial, p2 is moved to l1_4 (step 2), so satisfied.
6. p1 in a2 or l1_2 → covered in step 1 (l1_2).
7. p2 in l1_3 → covered in step 3.
8. p1 in l2_1 → covered in step 5.
9. If p1 in l2_1, then earlier in l1_2 → covered in step 1.
10. p2 in l2_1 or p1 in l1_3 → p2 is in l2_1 during step 7.6 (unload in l2_1), so satisfied.
11. p2 in a1 or p1 in l1_2 → p1 in l1_2 (step 1), so satisfied.
12. p2 in a2 → covered in step 7.7.
13. p1 in l1_3 and p2 in a2 → not covered yet. Need p1 in l1_3 and p2 in a2.

Ah, this is a problem. The current plan doesn't have p1 in l1_3. So how to achieve that?

Possible solution: After moving p1 to l1_2 (step 1), we need to move it to l1_3 at some point.

But why would we do that? Because constraint 13 requires both p1 in l1_3 and p2 in a2 in the same state.

So during the plan, there must be at least one state where both are true. So during the step where p2 is in a2 (step 7.7), we need p1 to be in l1_3.

But in the current plan, during step 7.7 (p2 loaded into a2 in l2_1), where is p1? At that point, p1 has been moved to l2_1 (step 5.8). So p1 is in l2_1, not l1_3. So this violates constraint 13.

So we need to adjust the plan to have a state where p1 is in l1_3 and p2 is in a2.

How to achieve that?

Perhaps after p1 is in l1_2 (step 1), we move it to l1_3 before moving it to the airport.

So adjust steps:

After step 1 (p1 in l1_2):

   - Drive t1 to l1_3 (drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1)
   - Load p1 into t1 (but p1 is in l1_2, t1 is there. So load p1 into t1.
   - Drive to l1_3 and unload.

So steps:

1.1. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
1.2. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1
1.3. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3

Now p1 is in l1_3. Then, move p1 to the airport.

But then, when p1 is in l1_3, we need to ensure that during that time or after, p2 is in a2. But how?

If during the steps where p1 is in l1_3, p2 is loaded into a2, then constraint 13 is satisfied. So perhaps during the steps where p2 is being loaded into a2 (step 7.7), p1 is in l1_3.

But timing is important. The state where p1 is in l1_3 and p2 is in a2 must exist.

So perhaps:

- Move p1 to l1_3 first.
- Then move p2 to a2.

But then p1 would be in l1_3 while p2 is in a2.

So let's adjust the plan:

After step 1 (p1 in l1_2), instead of moving p2 to l1_4, first move p1 to l1_3.

But this may disrupt other constraints. Let's see.

Alternative plan outline:

1. Move p1 to l1_2 (steps as before)
2. Move p1 to l1_3
3. Move p2 to l1_4
4. Move p2 to l1_3
5. Move p2 to l1_2
6. Move p1 to the airport and then to l2_1
7. Move p2 to a2 during this time

But this might complicate the ordering.

Alternatively, during the steps where p2 is being loaded into a2 (step 7.7), ensure that p1 is in l1_3.

But how? Let's think:

- Suppose after moving p1 to l1_3 (steps 1.1-1.3), we leave p1 there temporarily.
- Then proceed to move p2 to a2 (steps 7.1-7.7).
- During that time, p1 is in l1_3, and p2 is in a2 (step 7.7), satisfying constraint 13.
- Then move p1 to the airport and continue.

But this requires adding steps to move p1 to l1_3 and then back.

Let's adjust the plan:

Steps:

1. Move p1 from l1_5 to l1_2 using t1 (steps 1-4 as before).
2. Load p1 into t1 and drive to l1_3, unload (p1 in l1_3).
3. Move p2 to l1_4 (steps 2-4 as before).
4. Move p2 to l1_3 (step 3 as before).
5. Move p2 to l1_2 (step 4 as before).
6. Now, move p1 from l1_3 back to l1_2 (to load into truck and go to airport).
7. Then proceed to move p1 to l2_1 and then to l2_4.

But during step 7.7 (p2 in a2), p1 is in l1_3? Or not.

Wait, during step 7.7 (p2 being loaded into a2), where is p1?

If we have p1 in l1_3 during that time, then constraint 13 is satisfied.

So let's outline:

- After moving p1 to l1_3 (step 2), leave it there.
- Proceed to move p2 to l1_4, then to l1_3, then to l1_2.
- Then, move p2 to a2 via airplane.
- During the step when p2 is loaded into a2 (which is in l2_1), p1 is in l1_3.

But how does that work? Because p1 is in l1_3 (c1), and a2 is in l2_1 (c2). The constraint requires that in some state, both p1 is in l1_3 and p2 is in a2. So those can be true in different states. Wait, the constraint says "the following conditions are all true: p1 in l1_3 and p2 in a2". So they need to be true in the same state.

So we need to have a state where both are true. So during the same state, p1 is in l1_3 and p2 is in a2.

This complicates things. So during the steps where p2 is in a2 (loaded into a2 in l2_1), p1 must be in l1_3 at the same time.

How can that happen? Because p1 is in l1_3 (step 2), then later moved to l2_1. So during the time between step 2 and when p1 is moved to l1_1, p1 is in l1_3. If during that time, p2 is loaded into a2, then the state exists.

But how to overlap these steps.

For example:

- Step 2: p1 is in l1_3.
- Step 7.7: p2 is loaded into a2 (l2_1).
- At the same time (state), p1 is in l1_3.

So if these steps are ordered such that step 2 comes before step 7.7, then during step 7.7's state, p1 is still in l1_3.

But how?

Let me think of the sequence:

1. p1 moved to l1_3 (step 2).
2. Then, p2 is moved to l2_1 and loaded into a2 (step 7.7).
3. During the state after step 7.7, p2 is in a2, and p1 is still in l1_3.

Yes, that would satisfy constraint 13. Because after step 2, p1 is in l1_3. If p2 is loaded into a2 (step 7.7) before p1 is moved from l1_3, then in that state, both conditions are true.

So the sequence would be:

- Move p1 to l1_3.
- Then move p2 through various steps to a2.
- Then move p1 from l1_3 to l1_2, then to the airport, etc.

So during the step where p2 is in a2 (step 7.7), p1 is still in l1_3.

Thus, constraint 13 is satisfied.

So the updated plan steps:

1. Move p1 from l1_5 to l1_2.
2. Move p1 to l1_3.
3. Move p2 to l1_4.
4. Move p2 to l1_3.
5. Move p2 to l1_2.
6. Move p2 to a2 (steps involving flying to l2_1 and loading into a2).
7. Move p1 from l1_3 to l1_2, then to l2_1, and finally to l2_4.

But need to ensure that during step 6, p1 is still in l1_3.

So let's outline:

Steps:

1. Drive t1 to l1_5, load p1, drive to l1_2, unload.
2. Load p1 into t1 in l1_2, drive to l1_3, unload (now p1 in l1_3).
3. Drive t1 to l1_1, load p2, drive to l1_4, unload (p2 in l1_4).
4. Load p2 into t1, drive to l1_3, unload (p2 in l1_3).
5. Load p2 into t1, drive to l1_2, unload (p2 in l1_2).
6. Load p2 into t1, drive to l1_1, unload.
7. Load p2 into a1, fly to l2_1, unload.
8. Load p2 into a2 (now in a2 → constraint 12 and 13 satisfied).
9. Now, p1 is still in l1_3. So during this state (after step 8), constraint 13 is met (p1 in l1_3 and p2 in a2).
10. Then fly a2 back to l1_1, unload p2.
11. Drive p2 back to l1_2.
12. Move p1 from l1_3 to l1_2, then to l1_1, fly to l2_1, drive to l2_4.

But this adds many steps. However, it ensures all constraints are met.

This is getting very lengthy. Let's see if there's a shorter way.

Alternative approach: Use the airplanes to move p2 to a2 and ensure p1 is in l1_3 during that time.

But how?

Perhaps:

- Move p1 to l1_3 early on.
- Then, while p1 is there, move p2 to a2.

Let's try:

1. Move p1 from l1_5 to l1_3 using t1.
   a. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_5.
   b. Load p1.
   c. Drive to l1_3.
   d. Unload.
   Now p1 is in l1_3.

2. Now, move p2 from l1_1 to a2.
   a. Drive t1 to l1_1.
   b. Load p2.
   c. Drive to l1_1's airport.
   d. Load into a1.
   e. Fly to l2_1.
   f. Unload.
   g. Load into a2.
   Now p2 is in a2 (constraint 12). During this time, p1 is in l1_3 (constraint 13 satisfied).

3. Then move p1 from l1_3 to l1_2 (for constraint 9).
   a. Drive t1 to l1_3.
   b. Load p1.
   c. Drive to l1_2.
   d. Unload.

4. Then proceed to move p1 to l2_4 via airport.

5. Move p2 back to l1_2.

This way, all constraints are satisfied.

But let's check all constraints:

- p2 in l1_4 (constraint 1): Not yet addressed.

Ah, right, we missed moving p2 to l1_4. So this approach doesn't satisfy constraint 1.

So back to the drawing board.

Another approach:

- First handle p2's requirements.

1. Move p2 from l1_1 to l1_4 using t1.
2. Move p2 to l1_3.
3. Move p2 to l1_2.
4. Load p2 into a1 and fly to l2_1.
5. Load into a2 (constraint 12).
6. Fly a2 back to l1_1 and unload.
7. Drive p2 back to l1_2.

During step 5, p1 must be in l1_3. So before step 5, move p1 to l1_3.

But p1 starts in l1_5. So:

After step 1-3 for p2, move p1:

8. Drive t1 to l1_5, load p1, drive to l1_3, unload (p1 in l1_3).
9. Now, during step 5 (p2 in a2), p1 is in l1_3 (constraint 13 satisfied).

Then move p1 from l1_3 to l1_2 (for constraint 9), then to the airport.

But this requires careful ordering.

This seems possible, but the plan is getting long. However, given the constraints, it's necessary.

Now, considering all these steps, let's try to write the actual action sequence.

Final Plan Steps:

1. Move p2 to l1_4 (satisfy constraint 1):

   - drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 (t1 moves from initial l1_2 to l1_1)
   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
   - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
   - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

2. Move p2 to l1_3 (satisfy constraint 7):

   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
   - drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1
   - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

3. Move p2 to l1_2 (goal):

   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
   - drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1
   - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

4. Move p1 from l1_5 to l1_3 (satisfy constraint 13):

   - drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_5 c1
   - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
   - drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1
   - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3

5. Move p2 to a2 (satisfy constraints 12 and 13):

   - drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (wait, p2 is in l1_2. So t1 needs to be there. Hmm, this is conflicting.

Wait, after step 3, p2 is in l1_2. To load p2 into a2, we need to move it to l2_1. So steps for p2 after step 3:

   - drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 (t1 moves to l1_1)
   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 → no, t1 is now in l1_1. To load p2 into t1, t1 must be in l1_2. But after step 3, t1 is in l1_2 (after unloading p2). So:

   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
   - drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
   - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
   - loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
   - flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
   - unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
   - loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (now p2 is in a2 → constraint 12)
   - flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (to bring p2 back)
   - unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
   - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 → no, p2 is in l1_1. So t1 is in l1_1, load p2 into t1:

   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
   - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
   - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (back to goal)

At the same time, p1 is in l1_3 (step 4). So during the state after loading p2 into a2 (step 5.6), p1 is in l1_3, satisfying constraint 13.

6. Move p1 from l1_3 to l1_2 (for constraint 9):

   - drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_3 c1 (after step 5, t1 is in l1_2)
   - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
   - drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1
   - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2

7. Move p1 to l2_1:

   - drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
   - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (wait, p1 is in l1_2, need to load into t1 first)
   - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
   - drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
   - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
   - loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
   - flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
   - unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 (satisfy constraint 8)

8. Move p1 to l2_4:

   - drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2
   - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
   - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2
   - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (goal)

Now, check constraints:

- p1 in l1_5 (initial state) → constraint 4.
- When p1 is in l1_5 (initial), after that p2 is in l1_4 (step 1) → constraint 5.
- p2 in l1_4 (step 1) → constraint 1.
- p2 in l1_3 (step 2) → constraint 7.
- p2 in l1_2 (step 3) → goal and constraint 2.
- p2 in a2 (step 5.6) → constraint 12.
- p1 in l1_3 (step 4) and p2 in a2 (step 5.6) → constraint 13.
- p1 in l2_1 (step 7) → constraint 8, and earlier state in l1_2 (step 6) → constraint 9.
- p2 in a1 (step 5.4) → constraint 11.
- p2 in l2_1 (step 5.5) → constraint 10.
- p1 in l1_2 (step 6) → constraint 6.
- All other constraints should be covered.

This plan seems to satisfy all constraints. However, it's quite long. The user requested an optimal plan (shortest possible). But given the constraints, it's likely that this is the minimal steps required.

Now, let's format the actions according to the required structure, ensuring correct order and preconditions.
