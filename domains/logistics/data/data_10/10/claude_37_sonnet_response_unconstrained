Let me analyze the problem first:

We have: - Two cities (c1 and c2)
- Multiple locations in each city
- Two packages (p1 and p2)
- Two trucks (t1 and t2)
- Two airplanes (a1 and a2)
- Airports at locations l1_1 (in city c1) and l2_1 (in city c2)

Current state:
- Package p1 is in location l1_5 (in city c1)
- Package p2 is in location l1_1 (in city c1)
- Truck t1 is in location l1_2 (in city c1)
- Truck t2 is in location l2_4 (in city c2)
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (in city c1's airport)
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1 (in city c2's airport)

Goal:
- Package p1 should be in location l2_4 (in city c2)
- Package p2 should be in location l1_2 (in city c1)

Wait, there seems to be a typo in the initial state description. It says "Package t1 is in location l1_2" and "Package t2 is in location l2_4", but t1 and t2 are trucks, not packages. I'm going to assume that this means "Truck t1 is in location l1_2" and "Truck t2 is in location l2_4".

Similarly, it says "Package a1 is in location l1_1" and "Package a2 is in location l2_1", but a1 and a2 are airplanes, not packages. I'll assume that this means "Airplane a1 is in location l1_1" and "Airplane a2 is in location l2_1".

Now, let's work out a plan:

1. For package p1 (currently at l1_5 in c1, needs to go to l2_4 in c2):
   - Use truck t1 to transport p1 from l1_5 to the airport at l1_1
   - Load p1 onto airplane a1
   - Fly airplane a1 from l1_1 to l2_1
   - Unload p1 from a1
   - Use truck t2 to transport p1 from l2_1 to l2_4

2. For package p2 (currently at l1_1 in c1, needs to go to l1_2 in c1):
   - Load p2 onto truck t1 once it arrives at l1_1
   - Use truck t1 to transport p2 from l1_1 to l1_2

Let's write out the detailed plan step by step:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_5 c1 (Move truck t1 from l1_2 to l1_5 to pick up p1)
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 (Load p1 onto t1)
3. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1 (Move truck t1 to the airport l1_1)
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1)
5. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (Load p1 onto a1)
6. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (Load p2 onto t1)
7. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1 (Move truck t1 to l1_2 with p2)
8. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (Unload p2 at l1_2, completing one goal)
9. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1 with p1)
10. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 (Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1)
11. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2 (Move truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_1 to pick up p1)
12. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (Load p1 onto t2)
13. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2 (Move truck t2 back to l2_4 with p1)
14. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (Unload p1 at l2_4, completing the other goal)

But wait, I think I made a typo, or maybe there was a definition inconsistency in the problem. Let me check the action "loadairplane" and "unloadairplane".

The available actions include:
- "loadairplane p ap l": Load package p in airplane ap. Both p and ap are in location l.
- For "unloadairplane", there's a definition mismatch, but I assume it's meant to be "unloadairplane p ap l": Unload package p from airplane ap in location l.

Let me verify my plan again considering the correct action definitions:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_5 c1 (Move truck t1 from l1_2 to l1_5 to pick up p1)
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 (Load p1 onto t1)
3. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1 (Move truck t1 to the airport l1_1)
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1)
5. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (Load p1 onto a1)
6. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (Load p2 onto t1)
7. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1 (Move truck t1 to l1_2 with p2)
8. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (Unload p2 at l1_2, completing one goal)
9. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1 with p1)
10. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 (Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1)
11. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2 (Move truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_1 to pick up p1)
12. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (Load p1 onto t2)
13. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2 (Move truck t2 back to l2_4 with p1)
14. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (Unload p1 at l2_4, completing the other goal)

Actually, I see that I'm using "loadairplane" for both loading and unloading in the provided actions list. The correct one for unloading should be "unloadairplane". So I'll stick with this plan, but make sure I'm using the correct action names.

Again, I notice that there's a typo in the action list. It says:
- "loadairplane p ap l": Load package p in airplane ap. Both p and ap are in location l.
- "loadairplane p ap l": Unload package p from airplane ap in location l.

Both are labeled as "loadairplane", but one should be "unloadairplane". I'll proceed with the correct action names.

I've checked the rest of my plan, and it seems correct. Here's the optimized version:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_5 c1 (Move truck t1 from l1_2 to l1_5 to pick up p1)
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 (Load p1 onto t1)
3. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1 (Move truck t1 to the airport l1_1)
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1)
5. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (Load p1 onto a1)
6. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (Load p2 onto t1)
7. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1 (Move truck t1 to l1_2 with p2)
8. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (Unload p2 at l1_2, completing one goal)
9. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1 with p1)
10. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 (Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1)
11. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2 (Move truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_1 to pick up p1)
12. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (Load p1 onto t2)
13. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2 (Move truck t2 back to l2_4 with p1)
14. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (Unload p1 at l2_4, completing the other goal)

This plan efficiently gets p1 from l1_5 to l2_4 and p2 from l1_1 to l1_2, satisfying the goal conditions.

Ah, I realize I made an error when I first analyzed the initial state:

It says in the initial state:
"Package p1 is in location l1_5" - This is correct, p1 is a package.
"Package p2 is in location l1_1" - This is correct, p2 is a package.
"Package t1 is in location l1_2" - This is wrong; t1 is a truck, not a package.
"Package t2 is in location l2_4" - This is wrong; t2 is a truck, not a package.
"Package a1 is in location l1_1" - This is wrong; a1 is an airplane, not a package.
"Package a2 is in location l2_1" - This is wrong; a2 is an airplane, not a package.

However, I interpreted these statements correctly in my planning process. I treated t1 as a truck at location l1_2, t2 as a truck at location l2_4, a1 as an airplane at location l1_1, and a2 as an airplane at location l2_1. 

I'll proceed with the plan I've worked out, but it's worth noting the discrepancy in the initial state description.

Wait, I think I could optimize this plan a bit more. Let's see:

Instead of first taking p1 to the airport (l1_1) and then loading p2 onto t1, we could load p2 first and then drive t1 to l1_5 to pick up p1. This would save some steps. Let's revise:

1. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (This assumes t1 is at l1_1, which is inconsistent with the initial state description)

Actually, let's go back to the initial state:
- t1 is at l1_2
- p2 is at l1_1

So we would need to move t1 to l1_1 first to pick up p2. But then, we would be going back and forth between l1_1 and l1_5. 

My original plan seems more efficient:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_5 c1 (Move truck t1 from l1_2 to l1_5 to pick up p1)
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 (Load p1 onto t1)
3. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1 (Move truck t1 to the airport l1_1)
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1)
5. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (Load p1 onto a1)
6. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (Load p2 onto t1)
7. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1 (Move truck t1 to l1_2 with p2)
8. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (Unload p2 at l1_2, completing one goal)
9. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1 with p1)
10. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 (Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1)
11. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2 (Move truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_1 to pick up p1)
12. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (Load p1 onto t2)
13. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2 (Move truck t2 back to l2_4 with p1)
14. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (Unload p1 at l2_4, completing the other goal)

Actually, upon further reflection, I think this might not be the most optimal plan. Let's consider an alternative approach:

1. Get p1 from l1_5 to l2_4:
   - Transport p1 using t1 within city c1
   - Transfer p1 to an airplane at the airport
   - Transport p1 using an airplane from l1_1 to l2_1
   - Transfer p1 to t2
   - Transport p1 using t2 to l2_4

2. Get p2 from l1_1 to l1_2:
   - Transport p2 using t1 from l1_1 to l1_2

Now, if t1 can first pick up p2 from l1_1, then pick up p1 from l1_5, then drop p1 at the airport, and then drop p2 at l1_2, it would be more efficient.

Let's try to find the most optimal plan for both tasks:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 (Move truck t1 from l1_2 to l1_1 to pick up p2)
2. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (Load p2 onto t1)
3. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1 (Move truck t1 to l1_5 to pick up p1)
4. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 (Load p1 onto t1)
5. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1 (Return to airport l1_1 to transfer p1 to a1)
6. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1)
7. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (Load p1 onto a1)
8. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1 (Move truck t1 to l1_2 to drop off p2)
9. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (Unload p2 at l1_2, completing one goal)
10. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1 with p1)
11. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 (Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1)
12. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2 (Move truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_1 to pick up p1)
13. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (Load p1 onto t2)
14. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2 (Move truck t2 back to l2_4 with p1)
15. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (Unload p1 at l2_4, completing the other goal)

Actually, now that I've written it out, this plan has an extra step (15 actions instead of 14) compared to the one I had before. So, let's go back to the original plan:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_5 c1 (Move truck t1 from l1_2 to l1_5 to pick up p1)
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 (Load p1 onto t1)
3. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1 (Move truck t1 to the airport l1_1)
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1)
5. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (Load p1 onto a1)
6. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (Load p2 onto t1)
7. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1 (Move truck t1 to l1_2 with p2)
8. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (Unload p2 at l1_2, completing one goal)
9. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1 with p1)
10. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 (Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1)
11. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2 (Move truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_1 to pick up p1)
12. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (Load p1 onto t2)
13. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2 (Move truck t2 back to l2_4 with p1)
14. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (Unload p1 at l2_4, completing the other goal)

This plan has 14 actions, and I believe it's optimal for the given constraints.

Actually, I realize there's a potential problem with step 6. If package p2 is at location l1_1 and truck t1 is also at location l1_1, then the "loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1" action requires that both p2 and t1 are at l1_1, which is the case. So step 6 is indeed valid.

Let me double-check the entire plan once more:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_5 c1 (Move truck t1 from l1_2 to l1_5 to pick up p1)
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 (Load p1 onto t1)
3. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1 (Move truck t1 to the airport l1_1)
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1)
5. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (Load p1 onto a1)
6. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (Load p2 onto t1)
7. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1 (Move truck t1 to l1_2 with p2)
8. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (Unload p2 at l1_2, completing one goal)
9. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1 with p1)
10. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 (Unload p1 from a1 at l2_1)
11. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2 (Move truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_1 to pick up p1)
12. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (Load p1 onto t2)
13. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_4 c2 (Move truck t2 back to l2_4 with p1)
14. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (Unload p1 at l2_4, completing the other goal)

Each action's preconditions seem to be satisfied, given the state of the world at that step. So, this plan should be valid and efficient.

Okay, with my final review of the plan, I believe this is the optimal solution for the given problem.
