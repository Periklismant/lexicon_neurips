The world consists of cities, where each city may include multiple locations. One location of each city is an airport. The world may also include trucks, airplanes and packages. Trucks may move between locations in a city, while airplanes may move between airports. Trucks and airplanes may carry packages.  You are a logistician that suggests plans to bring packages to specific locations. 

The available actions are the following:
	"loadtruck p t l": Load package p in truck t. Both p and t are in location l.
	"loadairplane p ap l": Load package p in airplane ap. Both p and ap are in location l.
	"unloadtruck p t l": Unload package p from truck t in location l.
	"loadairplane p ap l": Unload package p from airplane ap in location l.
	"drivetruck t l_from l_to c": Drive truck t from location l_from to location l_to in city c.
	"flyairplane ap l_from l_to": Fly airplane ap from location l_from to location l_to.

An action may only be performed if its preconditions are met.
The actions of this domain have the following preconditions:
	"loadtruck": You may only load package p in a truck t if p and t are in the same location l.
	"loadairplane": You may only load package p in a airplane ap if ap and t are in the same location l.
	"unloadtruck": You may only unload package p from a truck t in a location l if (i) t is situated in l, and (ii) p is in t.
	"unloadairplane": You may only unload package p from a airplane ap in a location l if (i) ap is situated in l, and (ii) p is in ap.
	"drivetruck": You may only move a truck t from location l_from to location l_to in a city c if (i) t is situated in l_from, and (ii) l_from and l_to are locations of c.
	"flyairplane": You may only fly an airplane ap from location l_from to location l_to if ap is situated in l_from.

The effects of an action are brought about after the action is performed.
An effect may be conditional, in the sense that it manifests only if some conditions hold.
 The actions of this domain have the following effects:
	"loadtruck": After loading a package p in a truck t at a location l, (i) p is no longer situated in l, and (ii) p is in t.
	"loadairplane": After loading a package p in an airplane ap at location l, (i) p is no longer situated in l, and (ii) p is in ap.
	"unloadtruck": After unloading a package p from a truck t in a location l, (i) p is no longer in t, and (ii) p is situated in l.
	"unloadairplane": After unloading a package p from an airplane ap in a location l, (i) p is no longer in ap, and (ii) p is situated in l.
	"drivetruck": After moving a truck t from location l_from to location l_to in a city c, (i) t is no longer situated in l_from, and (ii) t is situated in l_to.
	"flyairplane": After flying an airplane ap from location l_from to location l_to, (i) ap is no longer situated in l_from, and (ii) ap is situated in l_to.

The world includes the following objects:
	"Airplane a1"
	"Airplane a2"
	"City c1"
	"City c2"
	"Truck t1"
	"Truck t2"
	"Airport l1_1"
	"Location l1_2"
	"Location l1_3"
	"Location l1_4"
	"Location l1_5"
	"Airport l2_1"
	"Location l2_2"
	"Location l2_3"
	"Location l2_4"
	"Location l2_5"
	"Package p1"
	"Package p2"

The original state of the world is the following:
	"Location l1_1 is in city c1"
	"Location l1_2 is in city c1"
	"Location l1_3 is in city c1"
	"Location l1_4 is in city c1"
	"Location l1_5 is in city c1"
	"Location l2_1 is in city c2"
	"Location l2_2 is in city c2"
	"Location l2_3 is in city c2"
	"Location l2_4 is in city c2"
	"Location l2_5 is in city c2"
	"Package t1 is in location l1_2"
	"Package t2 is in location l2_4"
	"Package p1 is in location l1_5"
	"Package p2 is in location l1_1"
	"Package a1 is in location l1_1"
	"Package a2 is in location l2_1"

The task is to bring about the following situation:
	"Package p1 is in location l2_4"

A valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints:
	"The following expression must hold in at least one state: 
		"Package p2 is in location l1_4""
	"The following expression must hold in at least one state: 
		"Package p2 is in location l1_2""
	"If expression 
		"Package p2 is in location l1_2"
		holds in some state, then there must be an earlier state in which the following expression is true: 
		"At least one of the following conditions is true: "Package p2 is in location l1_4", "Package p1 is in location l1_4"""
	"The following expression must hold in at least one state: 
		"Package p1 is in location l1_5""

		holds in some state s, then expression
		"At least one of the following conditions is true: "Package p2 is in location l2_3", "Package p2 is in location l1_4""
		must hold at s or at some state after s"
	"The following expression must hold in at least one state: 
		"At least one of the following conditions is true: "Package p1 is in a2", "Package p1 is in location l1_2"""
	"The following expression must hold in at least one state:
