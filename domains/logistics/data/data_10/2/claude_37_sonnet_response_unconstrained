I need to make sure I understand the problem correctly. The world consists of various objects, and there are actions that can be performed, each with specific preconditions and effects.

First, let me clarify the objects:
- Cities: c1, c2
- Locations:
  - City c1: l1_1 (airport), l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5
  - City c2: l2_1 (airport), l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5
- Packages: p1, p2
- Trucks: t1, t2
- Airplanes: a1, a2

However, I notice a discrepancy in the initial state:
- "Package t1 is in location l1_5" - t1 is a truck, not a package.
- "Package t2 is in location l2_4" - t2 is a truck, not a package.
- "Package a1 is in location l1_1" - a1 is an airplane, not a package.
- "Package a2 is in location l2_1" - a2 is an airplane, not a package.

I think these should be "Truck t1", "Truck t2", "Airplane a1", and "Airplane a2" respectively. Let me proceed with this interpretation.

The goal is to have:
- Package p1 in location l1_2
- Package p2 in location l1_4

Let's plan this step by step:

Initial state:
- Package p1 is in location l1_1 (city c1's airport)
- Package p2 is in location l2_5 (in city c2)
- Truck t1 is in location l1_5 (in city c1)
- Truck t2 is in location l2_4 (in city c2)
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (city c1's airport)
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1 (city c2's airport)

Goal state:
- Package p1 is in location l1_2 (in city c1)
- Package p2 is in location l1_4 (in city c1)

Steps to achieve the goal:

For package p1:
1. Since p1 is already in city c1, we need a truck to transport it from the airport to l1_2.
2. We can use truck t1, but it's currently in l1_5, so it needs to move to l1_1 first.
3. Then, load p1 into t1, drive t1 to l1_2, and unload p1.

For package p2:
1. Since p2 is in city c2, we need to bring it to city c1.
2. We can use truck t2 to take p2 from l2_5 to the airport l2_1.
3. Then, load p2 onto an airplane (a2, since it's already at l2_1), fly to city c1's airport (l1_1).
4. Then, unload p2 from the airplane, load it onto a truck, drive to l1_4, and unload it.

Now, let me build a detailed plan:

For package p1:
1. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1 (Move t1 to the airport)
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (Load p1 onto t1)
3. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1 (Drive t1 to the destination)
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 (Unload p1 at the destination)

For package p2:
1. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2 (Move t2 to where p2 is)
2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 (Load p2 onto t2)
3. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 (Drive t2 to the airport in c2)
4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (Unload p2 at the airport)
5. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (Load p2 onto the airplane)
6. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (Fly to city c1's airport)
7. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (Unload p2 at city c1's airport)
8. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 (Move t1 back to the airport in c1 after dropping off p1)
9. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (Load p2 onto t1)
10. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1 (Drive t1 to the destination for p2)
11. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (Unload p2 at the destination)

However, I think this plan can be optimized. For instance, we can potentially reuse truck t1 for both packages, or maybe use both trucks, depending on the logistics.

Let me try a more optimized approach:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1 (Move t1 to the airport)
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (Load p1 onto t1)
3. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1 (Drive t1 to the destination)
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 (Unload p1 at the destination)
5. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2 (Move t2 to where p2 is) [This can be done in parallel with steps 1-4]
6. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 (Load p2 onto t2)
7. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 (Drive t2 to the airport in c2)
8. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (Unload p2 at the airport)
9. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (Load p2 onto the airplane)
10. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (Fly to city c1's airport)
11. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (Unload p2 at city c1's airport)
12. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 (Move t1 back to the airport in c1 after dropping off p1)
13. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (Load p2 onto t1)
14. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1 (Drive t1 to the destination for p2)
15. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (Unload p2 at the destination)

Actually, let's see if this can be further optimized. 

For one, I notice that the airplane a1 is already at city c1's airport (l1_1). So, instead of using a2 (which starts at l2_1), we can fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1, pick up p2, and fly back. This would save us some steps.

Let's see if this alternative approach would be more efficient:

For both packages:
1. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1 (Move t1 to the airport in c1)
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (Load p1 onto t1)
3. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1 (Drive t1 to the destination for p1)
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 (Unload p1 at the destination)
5. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (Fly a1 from c1's airport to c2's airport) [In parallel with steps 1-4]
6. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2 (Move t2 to where p2 is) [In parallel with steps 1-5]
7. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 (Load p2 onto t2)
8. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 (Drive t2 to the airport in c2)
9. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (Unload p2 at the airport in c2)
10. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (Load p2 onto a1)
11. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1 (Fly a1 back to c1's airport)
12. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (Unload p2 at city c1's airport)
13. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 (Move t1 back to the airport in c1 after dropping off p1)
14. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (Load p2 onto t1)
15. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1 (Drive t1 to the destination for p2)
16. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (Unload p2 at the destination)

So, it seems like this second approach also has 16 steps, of which some can be done in parallel. But in single-agent planning (which appears to be the context here), we're looking at the sequential length of the plan, so both approaches take 16 steps in the worst case.

Let me think if there's a further optimization possible.

Actually, if we fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1, and then immediately fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1, we can eliminate some steps because we're no longer moving both packages with the same truck t1. This would require t1 to go back and forth.

With this in mind, let's optimize even further:

For both packages:
1. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1 (Move t1 to the airport in c1)
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (Load p1 onto t1)
3. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1 (Drive t1 to the destination for p1)
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 (Unload p1 at the destination)
5. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1 (Move t1 to the destination for p2, in preparation)
6. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2 (Move t2 to where p2 is) [In parallel with steps 1-5]
7. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 (Load p2 onto t2)
8. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 (Drive t2 to the airport in c2)
9. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (Unload p2 at the airport in c2)
10. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (Load p2 onto a2)
11. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (Fly a2 to c1's airport)
12. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (Unload p2 at city c1's airport)
13. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (Load p2 onto t1)
14. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1 (Drive t1 to the destination for p2)
15. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (Unload p2 at the destination)

Wait, there's an issue with step 13. I had t1 move to l1_4 in preparation, but then I have it go back to l1_1. This doesn't make sense. Let me rethink this.

For both packages:
1. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1 (Move t1 to the airport in c1)
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (Load p1 onto t1)
3. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1 (Drive t1 to the destination for p1)
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 (Unload p1 at the destination)
5. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2 (Move t2 to where p2 is) [In parallel with steps 1-4]
6. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 (Load p2 onto t2)
7. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 (Drive t2 to the airport in c2)
8. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (Unload p2 at the airport in c2)
9. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (Load p2 onto a2)
10. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (Fly a2 to c1's airport)
11. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (Unload p2 at city c1's airport)
12. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 (Move t1 back to the airport in c1)
13. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (Load p2 onto t1)
14. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1 (Drive t1 to the destination for p2)
15. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (Unload p2 at the destination)

In this plan, t1 handles package p1 first, and then goes back to the airport to pick up p2 after it's flown in by a2. 

Actually, I realized there's no need to fly a1 anywhere. It's already at l1_1 (c1's airport), and we're not using it in the optimized plan.

Let me also consider an alternative route for p2. We can use a2 to fly p2 directly to l1_1, then use t1 to transport p2 to l1_4.

Actually, let's reconsider. There's another approach I haven't fully explored. What if we use a2 to fly p2 to city c1's airport, and then use t1 to transport both p1 and p2 to their respective destinations within city c1? This might be more efficient.

Let me lay out this plan:
1. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2 (Move t2 to where p2 is)
2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 (Load p2 onto t2)
3. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 (Drive t2 to the airport in c2)
4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (Unload p2 at the airport in c2)
5. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (Load p2 onto a2)
6. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (Fly a2 to c1's airport)
7. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (Unload p2 at city c1's airport)
8. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1 (Move t1 to the airport in c1) [This can be done in parallel with steps 1-7]
9. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (Load p1 onto t1)
10. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1 (Drive t1 to the destination for p1)
11. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 (Unload p1 at the destination)
12. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 (Move t1 back to the airport in c1)
13. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (Load p2 onto t1)
14. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1 (Drive t1 to the destination for p2)
15. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (Unload p2 at the destination)

Hmm, we're still at 15 steps in the sequential plan. Let's try to see if there's another approach.

Actually, since there are two trucks, why not use one for each package? We can use t1 for p1 and t2 for p2 (after p2 has been flown to city c1).

Here's the plan using two trucks:
1. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1 (Move t1 to the airport in c1)
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (Load p1 onto t1)
3. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1 (Drive t1 to the destination for p1)
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 (Unload p1 at the destination)
5. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2 (Move t2 to where p2 is) [This can be done in parallel with steps 1-4]
6. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 (Load p2 onto t2)
7. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 (Drive t2 to the airport in c2)
8. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (Unload p2 at the airport in c2)
9. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (Load p2 onto a2)
10. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (Fly a2 to c1's airport)
11. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (Unload p2 at city c1's airport)
12. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1 (Fly a2 back to c2's airport)
13. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (Load p2 onto t1)
14. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1 (Drive t1 to the destination for p2)
15. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (Unload p2 at the destination)

Wait, I'm still using t1 for both packages, and I unnecessarily flew a2 back to l2_1. Let me reconsider and ensure I'm being logical.

That was a mistake. If we're using the two trucks for the two packages, we'd need to first fly t2 from city c2 to city c1 after it has dropped off p2 at the airport in c2. But that's not possible given the rules (trucks can only move within cities).

So, our best approach seems to be to use t1 for both packages within city c1.

Let's finalize the plan:
1. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1 (Move t1 to the airport in c1)
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (Load p1 onto t1)
3. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1 (Drive t1 to the destination for p1)
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 (Unload p1 at the destination)
5. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2 (Move t2 to where p2 is) [This can be done in parallel with steps 1-4]
6. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 (Load p2 onto t2)
7. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 (Drive t2 to the airport in c2)
8. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (Unload p2 at the airport in c2)
9. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (Load p2 onto a2)
10. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (Fly a2 to c1's airport)
11. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (Unload p2 at city c1's airport)
12. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 (Move t1 back to the airport in c1)
13. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (Load p2 onto t1)
14. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1 (Drive t1 to the destination for p2)
15. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (Unload p2 at the destination)

I think this plan is the most efficient given the constraints. 

Actually, I just realized we're still doing unnecessary steps. In the real world, tasks would be done in parallel (t1 moving p1 while t2 moving p2), but in terms of a linear plan's length, I need to ensure each step is necessary.

Let's think about a different approach. What if we fly a1 (which is already at l1_1) to pick up p2 and bring it back to l1_1, while using t1 to move p1 from l1_1 to l1_2 and then to move p2 from l1_1 to l1_4?

Here's the plan with this approach:
1. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (Fly a1 from c1's airport to c2's airport)
2. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2 (Move t2 to where p2 is) [In parallel with step 1]
3. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 (Load p2 onto t2)
4. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 (Drive t2 to the airport in c2)
5. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (Unload p2 at the airport in c2)
6. loadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (Load p2 onto a1)
7. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1 (Fly a1 back to c1's airport)
8. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (Unload p2 at city c1's airport)
9. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1 (Move t1 to the airport in c1) [In parallel with steps 1-8]
10. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (Load p1 onto t1)
11. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1 (Drive t1 to the destination for p1)
12. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 (Unload p1 at the destination)
13. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 (Move t1 back to the airport in c1)
14. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (Load p2 onto t1)
15. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1 (Drive t1 to the destination for p2)
16. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (Unload p2 at the destination)

So this is 16 steps, which doesn't seem to be an improvement. Let's try another approach.

Actually, I just realized we have 2 packages, 2 trucks, and 2 airplanes. What if we use a1 (which is already at l1_1) to transport p1 from the airport to its destination, and use a2 (which is already at l2_1) to transport p2 from c2 to c1, and then t1 (which is at l1_5) to transport p2 from the airport to its destination?

Here's the plan with this approach:
1. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1 (Move t1 to the airport in c1)
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (Load p1 onto t1)
3. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1 (Drive t1 to the destination for p1)
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 (Unload p1 at the destination)
5. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2 (Move t2 to where p2 is) [In parallel with steps 1-4]
6. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 (Load p2 onto t2)
7. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 (Drive t2 to the airport in c2)
8. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (Unload p2 at the airport in c2)
9. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (Load p2 onto a2)
10. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (Fly a2 to c1's airport)
11. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (Unload p2 at city c1's airport)
12. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 (Move t1 back to the airport in c1)
13. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (Load p2 onto t1)
14. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1 (Drive t1 to the destination for p2)
15. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (Unload p2 at the destination)

OK, so this is 15 steps. I think this is the most efficient plan for the given problem and constraints. I can further explain the optimization if needed, but I believe this is a good solution.

Now, let's list out the final plan:

```
drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
```

Actually, let's double-check the initial setup again. There seems to be a discrepancy with the object types:

- "Package t1 is in location l1_5" - t1 is a truck, not a package.
- "Package t2 is in location l2_4" - t2 is a truck, not a package.
- "Package a1 is in location l1_1" - a1 is an airplane, not a package.
- "Package a2 is in location l2_1" - a2 is an airplane, not a package.

I think these should be "Truck t1", "Truck t2", "Airplane a1", and "Airplane a2" respectively.

Actually, let's look at the loadairplane and unloadairplane actions. There seems to be a typo in the description:

- "loadairplane p ap l": Load package p in airplane ap. Both p and ap are in location l.
- "loadairplane p ap l": Unload package p from airplane ap in location l.

The second one should be "unloadairplane" instead of a repeated "loadairplane". I've been interpreting it as "unloadairplane" in my planning.

Let me go through the plan once more to make sure it's correct and optimal:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1 (Move t1 to the airport in c1)
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (Load p1 onto t1)
3. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1 (Drive t1 to the destination for p1)
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 (Unload p1 at the destination)
5. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2 (Move t2 to where p2 is)
6. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 (Load p2 onto t2)
7. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 (Drive t2 to the airport in c2)
8. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (Unload p2 at the airport in c2)
9. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (Load p2 onto a2)
10. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (Fly a2 to c1's airport)
11. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (Unload p2 at city c1's airport)
12. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 (Move t1 back to the airport in c1)
13. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (Load p2 onto t1)
14. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1 (Drive t1 to the destination for p2)
15. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (Unload p2 at the destination)

But wait, I'm concerned about the specification's typos. Let me check the actions and state to be sure.

Actually, I'm still confused about the initial state. It says:
"Package t1 is in location l1_5" - t1 is a truck, not a package.
"Package t2 is in location l2_4" - t2 is a truck, not a package.
"Package a1 is in location l1_1" - a1 is an airplane, not a package.
"Package a2 is in location l2_1" - a2 is an airplane, not a package.
"Package p1 is in location l1_1" - This is correct, p1 is a package.
"Package p2 is in location l2_5" - This is correct, p2 is a package.

Hmm. Why do you use "package" to describe the initial state, if t1/t2/a1/a2 aren't packages?

Ok, I think these are simple typos made in the specification text, and t1/t2 are supposed to be trucks and a1/a2 are airplanes, and the initial state lines simply say where these objects are, but incorrectly label them as "packages". I'll proceed with t1/t2 as trucks and a1/a2 as airplanes. But to be more confident, let me check elsewhere in the specification.

From the object declarations:
```
"truck t1"
"truck t2"
"airplane a1"
"airplane a2"
```
which confirms that t1/t2 are trucks and a1/a2 are airplanes.

So, I'm going to proceed with the plan I outlined above, understanding that the initial state should really be:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_5 (in city c1)
- Truck t2 is in location l2_4 (in city c2)
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (city c1's airport)
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1 (city c2's airport)
- Package p1 is in location l1_1 (city c1's airport)
- Package p2 is in location l2_5 (in city c2)

With this understanding, I believe the plan I've outlined is correct and optimal. Let me finalize it:

```
drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2

loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
