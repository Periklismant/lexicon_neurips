Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. Hmm, the goal is to get package p1 to location l1_4 and p2 to l2_4. Let's see where everything is initially.

First, looking at the original state. The objects are spread across cities c1 and c2. Let's note down the initial positions:

- p1 is in l2_2 (city c2).
- p2 is in l2_3 (city c2).
- t1 is in l1_4 (city c1). Wait, wait, the original state says "Package t1 is in location l1_4". Wait, t1 is a truck, right? Wait, the objects listed include trucks t1 and t2. So maybe that's a typo. Wait, the original state says "Package t1 is in location l1_4" but t1 is a truck. That can't be right. Wait, maybe there's a mistake here. Because trucks are supposed to be in locations. Oh wait, maybe the initial state is written as "Truck t1 is in location l1_4". Because the user might have made a typo. Otherwise, if t1 is a package, that's conflicting with the objects listed. Let me check the problem again.

Wait, the objects are listed as:

"package p1"
"package p2"
"truck t1"
"truck t2"
"airplane a1"
"airplane a2"

So t1 and t2 are trucks, not packages. So the original state mentions "Package t1 is in location l1_4" — that's probably a mistake. Maybe it's supposed to be "Truck t1 is in location l1_4". Otherwise, if t1 is a package, that's conflicting with the problem's object list. Since the user provided the problem, perhaps they made a typo. Let's proceed under the assumption that "Package t1" is a typo and should be "Truck t1". Otherwise, the problem is inconsistent. Because t1 is a truck, not a package. Similarly for t2. Otherwise, if the original state says that packages t1 and t2 are in certain locations, but those are trucks, which are different objects. So this must be an error in the problem statement. Let me check the original state again:

Original state:

"Package t1 is in location l1_4"
"Package t2 is in location l2_2"
"Package p1 is in location l2_2"
"Package p2 is in location l2_3"
"Package a1 is in location l1_1"
"Package a2 is in location l2_1"

Wait, this is confusing. Because a1 and a2 are airplanes, right? So "Package a1 is in location l1_1" — that's also a mistake. Because airplanes are not packages. So the initial state must have errors. The user probably meant that the trucks and airplanes are in certain locations. For example, Truck t1 is in l1_4, Truck t2 in l2_2, Airplane a1 in l1_1, etc. Otherwise, the problem is impossible. Because airplanes and trucks can't be loaded as packages. So I need to make sense of this. Let's proceed by correcting those entries:

Original state (corrected):

- Truck t1 is in location l1_4 (city c1)
- Truck t2 is in location l2_2 (city c2)
- Package p1 is in location l2_2 (city c2)
- Package p2 is in location l2_3 (city c2)
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (city c1)
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1 (city c2)

Otherwise, if the original state says that trucks and airplanes are packages, that's impossible. So I'll proceed with this corrected initial state.

Now, the goal is to have p1 in l1_4 (c1) and p2 in l2_4 (c2). Let's think about how to move these packages.

Starting with p1: it's in l2_2 (c2) which is a city c2 location. The target is l1_4 in c1. So to get from c2 to c1, we need an airplane. Because trucks can't move between cities. So the plan would involve moving p1 from l2_2 to the airport in c2 (l2_1), then fly it to c1's airport (l1_1), then transport it via truck to l1_4.

For p2: it's in l2_3 (c2), needs to go to l2_4 (c2). Since both are in the same city, we can use a truck. But where is the truck? Truck t2 is in l2_2. So need to drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_3, load p2, drive to l2_4, unload.

But let's check the initial positions again. If t2 is in l2_2 (as corrected), then:

For p2:

1. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_3 (possible since same city c2)
2. Load p2 into t2 at l2_3
3. Drive t2 to l2_4
4. Unload p2 at l2_4

That's straightforward.

For p1:

Current location l2_2 (c2), needs to go to l1_4 (c1). So steps:

1. Move p1 to the airport in c2 (l2_1). How? Use a truck. But which truck is in c2? t2 is in l2_2 initially. So:

- Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_2 (but that's same location, not needed). Wait, p1 is already in l2_2. So maybe load p1 into t2 at l2_2.

Wait, initial position: p1 is in l2_2. Truck t2 is in l2_2. So:

1. Load p1 into t2 at l2_2 (loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2)
2. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1 (since l2_1 is the airport in c2, but is it part of city c2? Yes. According to the original locations, l2_1 is in c2. So drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
3. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_1 (now p1 is at l2_1)
4. Load p1 into airplane a2 (since a2 is at l2_1)
5. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1 (c1's airport)
6. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1
7. Load p1 into truck t1 (t1 is at l1_4, but wait, where is t1? Original corrected state says t1 is in l1_4. So if t1 is in l1_4 (c1), how to get to l1_1 (the airport in c1). We need to drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1. Wait, but initially, t1 is in l1_4. So:

Steps for moving p1 to l1_4:

After step 6, p1 is at l1_1. To get it to l1_4, we need a truck in c1. Truck t1 is in l1_4. So to move t1 from l1_4 to l1_1, then back. Wait, that's possible. Let's see:

7. After unloading p1 at l1_1, we need to get it into t1. But t1 is in l1_4. So first, drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1 (airport), load p1 into t1, then drive back to l1_4 and unload.

So steps for p1:

6. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1 (now p1 is in l1_1)
7. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1 (drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1)
8. Load p1 into t1 at l1_1 (loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1)
9. Drive t1 back to l1_4 (drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1)
10. Unload p1 at l1_4 (unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4)

That works.

So combining both plans:

For p2:

1. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_3 (c2)
2. Load p2 into t2 at l2_3
3. Drive t2 to l2_4
4. Unload p2

For p1:

a. Load p1 into t2 at l2_2 (since p1 and t2 are there)
b. Drive t2 to l2_1
c. Unload p1 at l2_1
d. Load p1 into a2
e. Fly a2 to l1_1
f. Unload p1 at l1_1
g. Drive t1 to l1_1
h. Load p1 into t1
i. Drive t1 back to l1_4
j. Unload p1

Now, check the order. Some steps can be done in parallel if possible, but since the problem is sequential, need to find the optimal order, possibly interleaving steps for p1 and p2 to minimize total actions.

Wait, but the problem states that we need an optimal plan (shortest possible). So let's see.

For p2: the steps are 4 actions (drive t2 to l2_3, load, drive to l2_4, unload). For p1: 10 steps (from a to j). But maybe there's a way to optimize.

Wait, step a to j for p1 is 10 steps? Let's count:

a. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (1)
b. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 (2)
c. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (3)
d. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (4)
e. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (5)
f. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (6)
g. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 (7)
h. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (8)
i. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1 (9)
j. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4 (10)

So 10 actions for p1. For p2: 4 actions. But since some steps can be done in parallel if possible, but the order might require some actions to be sequential. However, the user wants the shortest possible plan. Let's see if there's a way to interleave the actions for p1 and p2.

For example, while the airplane is flying, maybe the truck can be moving for p2. But since the planner has to write a sequence, the order matters.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find a shorter path for p1.

Wait, after flying a2 to l1_1 with p1, maybe there's another truck in c1 that can take p1 to l1_4. But according to the problem, the trucks are t1 (in c1) and t2 (in c2). So t1 is the only truck in c1. So yes, t1 must be used.

But initially, t1 is in l1_4. So to get t1 to l1_1 (airport), we need to drive it there. Then load p1, then drive back.

Alternatively, maybe using airplane a1 in c1. Wait, a1 is at l1_1. Wait, but a1 is an airplane. So unless we need to fly within c1, but airplanes can only move between airports. So perhaps a1 is already at l1_1, which is an airport. But for moving within the same city, you can't use airplanes; they can only go to other airports. So for moving within c1, you must use a truck.

So the steps for p1 are as above.

Now, let's see if the plan can be optimized.

For p2:

Steps are:

1. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_3 (drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2)
2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
3. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

For p1, as before.

Now, total actions: 10 +4=14. But maybe some steps can be done in parallel or reordered to save steps.

Wait, but the two packages are in different cities. So the steps for p1 and p2 can be interleaved. For example, after loading p1 into a2 and flying to l1_1, while the airplane is en route, the truck t2 can handle p2. But since actions are sequential, perhaps the steps for p2 can be done in parallel with some of the p1 steps. But the minimal total steps would be the sum of the longest chain for each package, but some steps can overlap.

But let's think: For p1, after step e (fly a2 to l1_1), the next steps involve the airplane arriving, unloading, then truck movement. Meanwhile, for p2, steps 1-4 can be done while the airplane is in flight. So maybe interleave them.

But to find the optimal plan, perhaps the total steps can be 10 (for p1) and 4 (for p2), but some steps can be done in between, but no overlap. Let's check.

Let's outline the steps in order:

For p1:

1. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
2. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
3. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
4. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
5. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
6. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
7. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
8. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
9. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
10. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

For p2:

11. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2 (Wait, after step 2, t2 is at l2_1. But p2 is at l2_3. So how does t2 get to l2_3? Wait, initial step for p2 was:

Original plan for p2: t2 is in l2_2. But after step 2 (drivetruck t2 to l2_1), t2 is now in l2_1. So the previous plan for p2 is not possible because t2 is moved. So this is a problem.

Ah! This is a critical mistake. Because the initial plan for p1 uses t2 to move p1 to the airport, which means t2 is no longer in l2_2. Therefore, the initial plan for p2 can't use t2 unless we first return t2 to l2_2, which would add steps. So this complicates things.

Wait, this is a problem. Let me re-examine.

Initially, t2 is in l2_2. Package p1 is in l2_2. So in the initial state, p1 is in l2_2, and t2 is in l2_2. So first action could be to load p1 into t2 (loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2). Then drive t2 to l2_1 (airport). Then unload p1. Then, t2 is in l2_1.

But for p2, which is in l2_3, we need to use a truck to move it. The only truck in c2 is t2. So after moving t2 to l2_1 for p1's transport, we need to move t2 back to l2_3 to pick up p2. That adds steps. Which complicates the plan.

So this is a key issue. If we use t2 to transport p1 to the airport, then t2 is left at l2_1. To get p2 from l2_3 to l2_4, we need to use t2 again. So after step 3 (unload p1 at l2_1), t2 is at l2_1. So to get to l2_3, we need to drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_3 (possible, same city c2). Then load p2, drive to l2_4, unload.

So steps for p2 would be:

4. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2 (after step 3)
5. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
6. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
7. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

But this adds steps. So the total steps for p1 and p2 become:

For p1:

1. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
2. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
3. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
4. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
5. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
6. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
7. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
8. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
9. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
10. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

For p2:

11. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
12. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
13. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
14. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

Total 14 actions. But perhaps there's a way to optimize.

Wait, but maybe we can interleave the steps for p1 and p2 to save steps. For example, after step 5 (fly a2 to l1_1), which takes time, maybe during the flight, we can do some steps for p2. However, the flight is a single action. So after step 5 (fly), the airplane arrives at l1_1. The unloading can happen next. Meanwhile, steps for p2 could be done in between. Let's see:

The sequence would be:

1. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
2. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
3. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
4. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
5. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
6. (Now, while a2 is flying, can we start handling p2? No, because actions are sequential. So after flying, unload p1 from a2, then proceed.

Alternatively, after step 4, load p1 into a2, then fly. Then, while the airplane is flying, start moving t2 back. But no, the actions are sequential. So after step 5 (fly), you have to unload p1 from a2 (step 6), then drive t1 (steps 7-10). But during that time, t2 is at l2_1. So after step 5, you can start moving t2 to l2_3 for p2:

6. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
7. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
8. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
9. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

Then proceed with unloading p1 from a2 and moving it via t1. But this would mean the steps for p2 are done after step 5 (fly) but before handling p1's arrival. Let's see:

But wait, after step 5 (fly), the airplane is at l1_1. So step 6 could be unloading p1 from a2 at l1_1. But if we do steps for p2 after step 5, that would interleave:

Sequence:

1. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
2. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
3. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
4. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
5. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
6. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2 (start moving t2 for p2)
7. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
8. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
9. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
10. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (but can this be done after flying? Yes, because after flying, the airplane is at l1_1. But step 6-9 are moving t2. But step 10 is unloading p1 from a2. But the airplane is at l1_1, so unloading can be done at any time after the flight. However, unloading p1 from the airplane requires that the airplane is at l1_1 and p1 is in a2. So the correct order should be to unload p1 from a2 after flying. So steps 5 must be followed by step 10 (unload), not interleaved. So step 5: fly, step 6: unload.

So perhaps the steps can't be interleaved here. Because after flying, you need to unload the package before using the truck in c1. So the correct order is:

After step 5 (fly), step 6 must be unload p1 from a2. Then, steps 7-10 for moving p1 via t1. Meanwhile, steps for p2 would be after step 3 (unload p1 at l2_1), then steps 4 (load into a2), 5 (fly), then steps for p2 can be done.

Wait, after step 3, t2 is at l2_1. So after step 3, perhaps we can start moving t2 back for p2. But step 4 is loading p1 into a2. So after step 3:

3. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
4. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2 (for p2)
5. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
6. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
7. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
Then proceed with p1:

8. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (Wait, no, because after step 3, p1 is at l2_1. But after step 4, t2 has left l2_1. But the airplane a2 is at l2_1. So after step 3, p1 is at l2_1. So step 4 is drivetruck t2 to l2_3. Then, p1 is still at l2_1. So after step 7 (unloading p2), then we need to load p1 into a2, which is at l2_1. But airplane a2 is at l2_1 in the initial state. Wait, no. The original state says "Package a2 is in location l2_1". But a2 is an airplane, so corrected to "Airplane a2 is in location l2_1". So a2 is at l2_1. So after step 3, p1 is at l2_1. So we can load p1 into a2 after step 3, but before moving t2. So steps:

After step 3 (unload p1 at l2_1):

4. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (requires a2 is at l2_1 and p1 is there)
5. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
6. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
Then steps for p1 continue.

Meanwhile, steps for p2 can be done after step 3, but after step 4 (loading p1 into a2), we need to move t2 to l2_3. So steps:

After step 4:

7. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
8. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
9. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
10. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

Then steps 5-6 for flying and unloading p1. Then steps for moving p1 via t1.

Wait, but the sequence becomes:

1. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
2. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
3. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
4. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
7. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
8. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
9. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
10. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
5. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
6. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
11. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
12. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
13. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
14. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

But this is problematic because step 5 (fly) is after step 4 (load), but steps 7-10 are done before flying. However, after step 4 (loading p1 into a2), the airplane a2 is still at l2_1. So flying can be done after step 4, but in this sequence, steps 7-10 are done after step 4 but before step 5. So this is possible. Let's check the order:

After loading p1 into a2 (step4), the airplane is still at l2_1. Then, move t2 to l2_3 (step7), load p2 (step8), drive to l2_4 (step9), unload (step10). Then, fly a2 to l1_1 (step5), unload p1 (step6), then move t1.

But wait, the fly action (step5) must come after step4 (loading), but in this case, steps7-10 are inserted between step4 and step5. Is that allowed? Yes, because after loading p1 into a2, the airplane is still at l2_1. So you can delay the fly action. However, during steps7-10, the airplane is at l2_1 with p1 inside. So steps7-10 can be done while the airplane is still there. Then, after that, you fly it.

So this way, the total steps would be 14 actions, but ordered differently. But does this make sense? Let's check the sequence:

1. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
2. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
3. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
4. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (now p1 is in a2 at l2_1)
5. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2 (move t2 to l2_3)
6. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
7. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
8. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (p2 is done)
9. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (now a2 is at l1_1)
10. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (p1 is at l1_1)
11. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 (t1 moves to airport)
12. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
13. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
14. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

This sequence is 14 steps. But perhaps there's a way to reduce the steps.

Wait, after step4 (load p1 into a2), can we fly a2 to l1_1 before moving t2 for p2? If yes, then:

1. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
2. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
3. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
4. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
5. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
6. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (p1 at l1_1)
7. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2 (now moving t2 for p2)
8. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
9. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
10. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
11. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
12. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
13. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
14. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

This is also 14 steps. So no reduction.

But perhaps steps for p2 can be done while the airplane is flying. But since actions are sequential, you can't do two at the same time. So the total steps are 14.

But maybe there's a way to save steps by reusing t2 for both packages. Let's think again.

Alternative approach for p1: Use airplane a2 to carry p1 from l2_1 to l1_1. Then use truck t1 to move p1 from l1_1 to l1_4. But t1 is initially at l1_4. So we need to move t1 to l1_1, which takes two steps: drive to l1_1, then back. But what if there's a way to avoid moving t1?

Alternatively, is there another truck in c1? No, only t1. So we have to move t1 to l1_1 to load p1, then drive back.

So steps 11-14 are necessary.

Is there a way to avoid moving t1 twice? For example, if t1 is already at l1_1, but initially it's at l1_4. So no.

Alternatively, maybe after unloading p1 at l1_1, we can use a different method. But there's no other truck.

So steps 11-14 are necessary.

Thus, the total steps are 14. Is this the minimal possible? Let's see.

Alternative idea: After flying a2 to l1_1, unload p1. Then, perhaps use airplane a1 (which is at l1_1) to fly p1 to another airport in c1. But wait, the locations in c1 are l1_1 to l1_5. l1_1 is an airport. Are there other airports? According to the problem statement, each city has one airport. So in c1, the airport is l1_1. So flying within c1 is not possible. Thus, the only way to move p1 from l1_1 to l1_4 is by truck.

Thus, steps 11-14 are required.

Therefore, the minimal plan is 14 steps. But is there any way to reduce this?

Wait, after unloading p1 from a2 at l1_1 (step6), truck t1 is at l1_4. So to load p1 into t1, t1 must be at l1_1. So we need to drive t1 to l1_1 (step11), load p1 (step12), then drive back (step13), unload (step14). So three steps for moving t1. Alternatively, if there's a way to have t1 already at l1_1, but no.

Another thought: Could we have a different airplane to move p1 from l2_1 to l1_1? No, a2 is the only airplane in c2. So no.

Alternatively, use a different truck in c2 for p2. But t2 is the only truck in c2. So no.

Hmm. So I think the minimal plan is 14 steps.

But let's check if there's a shorter path for p1. Suppose we use airplane a1 (which is in l1_1) to fly to l2_1, pick up p1, and fly back. But wait, a1 is in l1_1 (c1). So steps would be:

Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1 (but l2_1 is in c2. So possible. Then load p1 into a1, fly back to l1_1. But then p1 is at l1_1 again, and we still need to use t1 to move to l1_4. So this would add steps:

Steps:

1. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
2. loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
3. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
4. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
5. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
6. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
7. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
8. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

But initial state: a1 is at l1_1. p1 is at l2_2. So to load p1 into a1, we need to get p1 to l2_1. Which requires using t2:

Original steps for p1 using a1:

1. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2 (if t2 is in l2_2)
2. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
3. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
4. loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 (but a1 is not there. We need to fly a1 to l2_1. So:

4. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
5. loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
6. flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1
7. unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
8. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
9. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
10. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
11. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

Meanwhile, for p2:

Same as before, using t2 after steps 3. So steps:

12. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
13. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
14. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
15. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

Total steps: 15, which is longer than the previous 14. So using a1 instead of a2 is worse.

Thus, the previous plan of 14 steps is better.

Therefore, the optimal plan is 14 steps. But let's check if there's any other optimization.

Wait, after step3 (unload p1 at l2_1), a2 is already at l2_1. So steps for p1 can be loaded into a2 and flown, while steps for p2 can use t2 after that. So the sequence would be:

1. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
2. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
3. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
4. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
5. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
6. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
7. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
8. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
9. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
10. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

For p2:

11. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
12. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
13. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
14. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4

So total 14 steps. This seems to be the minimal.

But wait, after step2, t2 is at l2_1. So steps for p2 could be done after step3. Because step3 unloads p1 at l2_1, then t2 is at l2_1. So steps for p2 can be done after step3:

4. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2 (for p2)
5. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
6. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
7. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
Then proceed with loading p1 into a2:

8. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
9. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
10. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
11. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
12. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
13. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
14. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

But here, steps for p2 are done first. But after step7 (unload p2), t2 is at l2_4. Then, to load p1 into a2 at l2_1, we need to have a2 at l2_1, which it is initially. But t2 is at l2_4. So steps for p1 after step7:

8. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (requires p1 is at l2_1 and a2 is there. But after step3, p1 is at l2_1. So after step7, p1 is still at l2_1. Because steps4-7 move t2 but don't affect p1. So yes. So this sequence is possible.

Thus, the steps would be:

1. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
2. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
3. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (p1 at l2_1, t2 at l2_1)
4. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
5. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
6. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
7. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4 (p2 done)
8. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (a2 is at l2_1)
9. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
10. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
11. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
12. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
13. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
14. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

This also has 14 steps. So same number of steps.

But this way, the steps for p2 are done earlier. But the total number is the same.

So in any case, the minimal plan is 14 steps. But is there a way to have fewer steps?

Wait, perhaps after loading p1 into a2, can we move t2 while the airplane is flying? But since the actions are sequential, no. The airplane must be flown first, then unloaded. So steps must be done in sequence.

Another angle: Can we move p1 and p2 in a different order? For example, handle p2 first. But p2 is in c2 and needs to go to l2_4. So steps for p2 are:

1. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_3
2. Load p2
3. Drive to l2_4
4. Unload.

This is 4 steps. Then use t2 to move p1. But after moving p2, t2 is at l2_4. To get p1 from l2_2 to l2_1:

5. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_2
6. Load p1
7. Drive to l2_1
8. Unload.

Then load into airplane a2, fly, etc. This adds steps. Total steps for p2: 4, for p1: 8 steps (steps5-8 for moving p1 to l2_1, plus steps for flying and truck t1). But this would total more steps. So not better.

Thus, the initial plan of 14 steps seems to be the minimal.

But let's verify that all actions are correct and preconditions are met.

Check p1's path:

- loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2: p1 and t2 are in l2_2. Correct.
- drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2: t2 is in l2_2, moving to l2_1 (same city). Correct.
- unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1: t2 is in l2_1, p1 is in t2. Correct.
- loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1: a2 is in l2_1, p1 is in l2_1. Correct.
- flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1: a2 is in l2_1. Correct.
- unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1: a2 is in l1_1, p1 is in a2. Correct.
- drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1: t1 is in l1_4, moving to l1_1 (same city). Correct.
- loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1: p1 is in l1_1, t1 is there. Correct.
- drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1: Correct.
- unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4: Correct.

For p2:

- drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2: t2 is in l2_1 (after step3), moving to l2_3. Correct.
- loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3: p2 is in l2_3, t2 is there. Correct.
- drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2: Correct.
- unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4: Correct.

All preconditions are met. The effects are applied correctly.

Thus, the plan is valid and has 14 steps. But wait, the problem asks for an optimal plan, which is the shortest possible. Are there any ways to reduce the steps further?

Wait, in the original state, airplane a2 is at l2_1 (corrected). So when we load p1 into a2, it's already at l2_1. So after step3 (unload p1 at l2_1), steps4 (load into a2) and step5 (fly) can be done. Then, after flying, unload and use t1.

But what if after step5 (fly), we can use t1 to move p1 from l1_1 to l1_4. But t1 is at l1_4. So we need to drive t1 to l1_1, load p1, then drive back. That's three steps. Can't be avoided.

So the steps are necessary.

Another observation: After step7 (drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1), can we combine steps? For example, after driving t1 to l1_1, load and drive back in one step? No, each action is separate. So no.

Thus, the minimal plan is 14 steps.

But wait, in the problem statement, the user provided the original state with "Package t1 is in location l1_4". If that's not a typo and t1 is a package, then the problem is impossible. But since the user listed t1 as a truck, it's a mistake. Assuming the corrected state, the plan is valid.

Therefore, the final answer is the sequence of 14 actions as outlined.
