Let me analyze this problem. I need to create a plan to transport packages p1 and p2 to specific locations.

First, let me clarify what we have in the initial state:
- Package p1 is in location l2_2 (in city c2)
- Package p2 is in location l2_3 (in city c2)
- Truck t1 is in location l1_4 (in city c1)
- Truck t2 is in location l2_2 (in city c2)
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (in city c1, which is an airport)
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1 (in city c2, which is an airport)

The goal is:
- Package p1 should be in location l1_4 (in city c1)
- Package p2 should be in location l2_4 (in city c2)

So I need to move:
1. p1 from l2_2 (city c2) to l1_4 (city c1)
2. p2 from l2_3 (city c2) to l2_4 (city c2)

Since p1 needs to move between cities, I'll need to use an airplane. For p2, I can use a truck since it's within the same city.

Let me plan each package's journey:

For p1 (from l2_2 to l1_4):
1. Use truck t2 to pick up p1 from l2_2
2. Drive truck t2 to airport l2_1
3. Unload p1 at l2_1
4. Load p1 onto airplane a2
5. Fly airplane a2 from l2_1 to l1_1
6. Unload p1 at l1_1
7. Use truck t1 (which is already at l1_4) to come to l1_1
8. Load p1 onto truck t1
9. Drive truck t1 back to l1_4
10. Unload p1 at l1_4

For p2 (from l2_3 to l2_4):
1. Drive truck t2 from l2_1 (where it ended up after helping p1) to l2_3
2. Load p2 onto truck t2
3. Drive truck t2 to l2_4
4. Unload p2 at l2_4

Wait, let me double-check the initial state again. There seems to be an inconsistency with my understanding:

The original state mentioned:
- Package t1 is in location l1_4
- Package t2 is in location l2_2

But t1 and t2 are trucks, not packages. Let me restate the initial state:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_4 (in city c1)
- Truck t2 is in location l2_2 (in city c2)
- Package p1 is in location l2_2 (in city c2)
- Package p2 is in location l2_3 (in city c2)
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (in city c1, which is an airport)
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1 (in city c2, which is an airport)

Now let me revise the plan:

For p1 (from l2_2 to l1_4):
1. Load p1 onto truck t2 at l2_2
2. Drive truck t2 to airport l2_1
3. Unload p1 at l2_1
4. Load p1 onto airplane a2
5. Fly airplane a2 from l2_1 to l1_1
6. Unload p1 at l1_1
7. Drive truck t1 from l1_4 to l1_1
8. Load p1 onto truck t1
9. Drive truck t1 back to l1_4
10. Unload p1 at l1_4

For p2 (from l2_3 to l2_4):
1. Drive truck t2 from l2_1 (where it ended up after helping p1) to l2_3
2. Load p2 onto truck t2
3. Drive truck t2 to l2_4
4. Unload p2 at l2_4

Wait, there's a problem. I see that in the original state:
"Package a1 is in location l1_1"
"Package a2 is in location l2_1"

But a1 and a2 are airplanes, not packages.

Let me clarify the initial state again based on the object definitions:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_4 (in city c1)
- Truck t2 is in location l2_2 (in city c2)
- Package p1 is in location l2_2 (in city c2)
- Package p2 is in location l2_3 (in city c2)
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (in city c1, which is an airport)
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1 (in city c2, which is an airport)

I think this is the correct interpretation of the initial state.

Now, let's create the plan:

For p1 (from l2_2 to l1_4):
1. Load p1 onto truck t2 at l2_2
2. Drive truck t2 to airport l2_1
3. Unload p1 from truck t2 at l2_1
4. Load p1 onto airplane a2
5. Fly airplane a2 from l2_1 to l1_1
6. Unload p1 from airplane a2 at l1_1
7. Drive truck t1 from l1_4 to l1_1
8. Load p1 onto truck t1
9. Drive truck t1 back to l1_4
10. Unload p1 from truck t1 at l1_4

For p2 (from l2_3 to l2_4):
1. Drive truck t2 from l2_1 (where it ended up after helping p1) to l2_3
2. Load p2 onto truck t2
3. Drive truck t2 to l2_4
4. Unload p2 from truck t2 at l2_4

Let me review this plan for any potential optimizations:

The plan for p1 requires waiting for truck t2 to drop off p1 at the airport before it can go pick up p2. But we have two trucks and two airplanes. We could potentially use truck t2 and airplane a2 for p1, and then use a different truck or a direct route for p2.

Actually, since p2 is already in city c2 and needs to go to a location in city c2, we don't need to involve the airplanes for p2 at all. After truck t2 drops off p1 at the airport l2_1, it can go directly to l2_3, pick up p2, and then go to l2_4.

Let me finalize the plan:

1. Load p1 onto truck t2 at l2_2
2. Drive truck t2 from l2_2 to l2_1
3. Unload p1 from truck t2 at l2_1
4. Load p1 onto airplane a2 at l2_1
5. Fly airplane a2 from l2_1 to l1_1
6. Unload p1 from airplane a2 at l1_1
7. Drive truck t1 from l1_4 to l1_1
8. Load p1 onto truck t1 at l1_1
9. Drive truck t1 from l1_1 to l1_4
10. Unload p1 from truck t1 at l1_4
11. Drive truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_3
12. Load p2 onto truck t2 at l2_3
13. Drive truck t2 from l2_3 to l2_4
14. Unload p2 from truck t2 at l2_4

This seems like an optimal plan as it:
1. Uses the closest truck (t2) to pick up p1
2. Uses an airplane (a2) to cross between cities
3. Uses the closest truck (t1) to deliver p1 to its final destination
4. Reuses truck t2 to handle the delivery of p2 within city c2

Let's now format this plan as required:

```
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
```

Actually, I need to double-check one of the actions. In my plan, I've been using:
- "unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1"

But in the problem description, there are two different action names:
- "loadairplane p ap l" for loading a package into an airplane
- "loadairplane p ap l" for unloading a package from an airplane (this seems to be a typo, as both load and unload have the same action name)

Let me clarify based on the preconditions and effects. The actions are:
- "loadtruck p t l": Load package p in truck t at location l
- "loadairplane p ap l": Load package p in airplane ap at location l
- "unloadtruck p t l": Unload package p from truck t at location l
- "loadairplane p ap l": Unload package p from airplane ap at location l (this should probably be "unloadairplane")

Actually, looking at the preconditions, I see:
- "unloadairplane": You may only unload package p from an airplane ap in a location l if...

And in the effects:
- "unloadairplane": After unloading a package p from an airplane ap in a location l...

So I believe there is a typo, and it should be "unloadairplane" for the unloading action.

I'll revise the plan to use "unloadairplane" for consistency:

```
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
```

Actually, there seems to be a typo in the problem description. Let me reconfirm the actions:

The actions explicitly listed in the problem description are:
1. "loadtruck p t l"
2. "loadairplane p ap l"
3. "unloadtruck p t l"
4. "loadairplane p ap l" (again, which is a duplicate of 2)
5. "drivetruck t l_from l_to c"
6. "flyairplane ap l_from l_to"

But, when looking at the preconditions and effects, there are references to an "unloadairplane" action.

Since the preconditions and effects explicitly mention "unloadairplane", and it would be illogical to have "loadairplane" for both loading and unloading, I'm confident that the fourth action should be "unloadairplane p ap l". I'll go with that interpretation.

Here's the revised plan:

```
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
```

Actually, I think I've been overthinking this. Let's just go with the actions as they're listed in the problem description and use "loadairplane" for the action of taking a package out of an airplane.

Wait, upon further review, I'm going with the understanding that there is indeed a typo in the action list. The fourth action should be "unloadairplane" and not "loadairplane" repeated. This is supported by the explicit naming in the preconditions and effects for the "unloadairplane" action.

The final plan is:

```
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
```

I'm sure the above plan is correct. However, there are some parts of the problem description that appear to have typos or inconsistencies:
1. The action list has "loadairplane" twice, where the second instance should likely be "unloadairplane"
2. The original state has packages t1, t2, a1, and a2, but these are actually trucks and airplanes, not packages.

Since the goal requires moving p1 to l1_4 and p2 to l2_4, and given the clarity in the preconditions and effects, I've interpreted the problem with the following initial state:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_4 (in city c1)
- Truck t2 is in location l2_2 (in city c2)
- Package p1 is in location l2_2 (in city c2)
- Package p2 is in location l2_3 (in city c2)
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (in city c1, which is an airport)
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1 (in city c2, which is an airport)

The plan I've provided should achieve the goal under this interpretation.

Hmm, let me double check the original problem state:

"Package t1 is in location l1_4"
"Package t2 is in location l2_2"
"Package p1 is in location l2_2"
"Package p2 is in location l2_3"
"Package a1 is in location l1_1"
"Package a2 is in location l2_1"

Actually, it's pretty clear that there's an issue. t1, t2, a1, and a2 are labeled as packages, even though we know from the object definitions that they are trucks and airplanes. I'm going to assume that these statements are meant to convey that these vehicles are at the mentioned locations. So:

- Truck t1 is in location l1_4
- Truck t2 is in location l2_2
- Package p1 is in location l2_2
- Package p2 is in location l2_3
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

This interpretation aligns with the object definitions and the goal. The plan I've formulated should be correct.

Just to be 100% sure, let me double-check the actions:

In the problem description, the actions are:
1. "loadtruck p t l": Load package p in truck t. Both p and t are in location l.
2. "loadairplane p ap l": Load package p in airplane ap. Both p and ap are in location l.
3. "unloadtruck p t l": Unload package p from truck t in location l.
4. "loadairplane p ap l": Load package p in airplane ap. Both p and ap are in location l. (This is a repeat of 2)
5. "drivetruck t l_from l_to c": Drive truck t from location l_from to location l_to in city c.
6. "flyairplane ap l_from l_to": Fly airplane ap from location l_from to location l_to.

But, when looking at the preconditions and effects, there are distinct references to an "unloadairplane" action.

Given the duplicated "loadairplane" and the explicit naming of "unloadairplane" in the preconditions and effects, it seems clear that the second occurrence of "loadairplane" is a typo and should be "unloadairplane".

Based on this understanding, my plan remains the same:

```
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3
drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4
```

I'm confident this plan is correct.
