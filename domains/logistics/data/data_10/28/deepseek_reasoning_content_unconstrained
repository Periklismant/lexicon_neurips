Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this planning problem. So, the goal is to get package p1 to location l1_1 and keep p2 in l1_3. The initial state has p1 and p2 both in l1_3. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the original state says "Package p1 is in location l1_3" and "Package p2 is in location l1_3". Oh, right. So both packages start in l1_3. The goal is to have p1 in l1_1 and p2 still in l1_3. Wait, but the goal says "Package p2 is in location l1_3", which is already true initially. So maybe p2 just needs to stay there, but maybe during the process, it might get moved and needs to be brought back. But the constraints might affect that. Let me check the constraints, but the user didn't mention any specific constraints beyond the usual action preconditions. Wait, the problem mentions "a set of constraints" but in the given problem statement, the constraints section is empty. Wait, looking back: the user wrote "A valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints:" and then nothing. So maybe there are no additional constraints beyond the action preconditions. Hmm, perhaps a typo. Or maybe the problem as given doesn't have extra constraints beyond the usual ones.

So, the main goal is to move p1 to l1_1, while p2 remains in l1_3. Let's see the initial state.

Looking at the objects:

Locations in c1: l1_1 (airport), l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5.

In c2: l2_1 (airport), l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5.

Packages: p1 and p2 are in l1_3. Wait, also, the original state mentions "Package t1 is in location l1_4", but t1 is a truck, right? Because the objects list includes "truck t1" and "truck t2". So maybe that's a typo. Wait, the original state says:

Wait the user wrote:

The original state includes:

"Package t1 is in location l1_4"

"Package t2 is in location l2_3"

But t1 and t2 are trucks, not packages. That must be a mistake. Because the objects list includes "truck t1" and "truck t2". So perhaps the user made a typo, and intended to say "Truck t1 is in location l1_4", same for t2. Otherwise, if t1 is a package, but the problem defines t1 as a truck, this is conflicting. So assuming that's a typo, and the correct initial state is that Truck t1 is in l1_4, Truck t2 is in l2_3. Similarly, "Package a1 is in location l1_1" and "Package a2 is in location l2_1" â€” but a1 and a2 are airplanes. So those are probably typos too. So the correct initial positions are:

Airplane a1 is in l1_1 (airport), and a2 in l2_1 (airport). Because airplanes can only be at airports. So perhaps the original state has typos where "Package" is used instead of "Truck" or "Airplane".

Assuming that, the initial state should be:

Truck t1 is in l1_4 (city c1).

Truck t2 is in l2_3 (city c2).

Airplane a1 is in l1_1 (airport of c1).

Airplane a2 is in l2_1 (airport of c2).

Packages p1 and p2 are in l1_3 (city c1).

So, the problem is to get p1 to l1_1 (which is an airport in c1), and keep p2 in l1_3. Since l1_1 is an airport, which is in c1. So to move p1 from l1_3 to l1_1, we might need to use a truck to transport it to the airport, then maybe load it into an airplane, but wait, why an airplane? Because l1_1 is in the same city, so perhaps using a truck is sufficient. Wait, the airports are part of the cities. So to move within the same city, we can use trucks. Airplanes are for moving between cities. So since p1 needs to go from l1_3 to l1_1, which are both in c1, we can use a truck.

Looking at the available trucks in c1: t1 is in l1_4. So we need to get t1 from l1_4 to l1_3, load p1 into it, then drive to l1_1.

Wait, l1_1 is the airport. So the plan steps could be:

1. Drive truck t1 from l1_4 to l1_3 (since both are in c1).

2. Load p1 into t1 at l1_3.

3. Drive t1 from l1_3 to l1_1.

4. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1.

But need to check if all preconditions are met. For example, after driving to l1_3, the truck is there. Then load p1. Then drive to l1_1.

Yes. That seems straightforward.

But wait, what about p2? The goal requires p2 to stay in l1_3. So during the process, we must not move p2. But if the initial state has both p1 and p2 in l1_3, when we load p1 into the truck, p2 remains there. Unless there's a mistake in the problem statement. But according to the original state, p2 is in l1_3. The goal requires p2 to be in l1_3, which is already the case. So perhaps the only action needed is moving p1. So the plan would be as I outlined.

Wait, but let me confirm the initial positions again. The original state says:

"Package t1 is in location l1_4"

But t1 is a truck, so that's a typo. So Truck t1 is in l1_4. Similarly for t2. So yes, the initial state for trucks is:

Truck t1 at l1_4 (c1), Truck t2 at l2_3 (c2). Airplanes a1 at l1_1 (c1), a2 at l2_1 (c2). Packages p1 and p2 at l1_3 (c1).

So the plan would be:

Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_3 (c1). Then load p1 into t1 at l1_3. Then drive t1 to l1_1 (airport in c1). Then unload p1 there. That's four steps.

But wait, l1_1 is an airport. But trucks can drive between any locations in the same city, including airports. So yes, possible.

But is there a shorter way? Let me think. If the truck is already in l1_4, which is in c1. The locations in c1 are l1_1, l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5. So the truck can drive from l1_4 to l1_3 (same city). Then load p1, drive to l1_1.

Yes, that's the correct path.

So the steps would be:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1

2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3

3. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1

4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

This would achieve the goal. And since p2 is already in l1_3, and we don't touch it, the goal condition is satisfied.

But wait, are there any constraints that I missed? The problem mentions that the plan must satisfy all constraints. Since the user didn't specify any additional constraints, I think the standard preconditions apply.

So yes, this plan should work. Let me check each action's preconditions and effects.

1. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1:

Pre: t1 is in l1_4 (yes), l_from and l_to are in c1 (yes). So valid.

Effect: t1 moves to l1_3.

2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3:

Pre: p1 and t1 are in l1_3. After step 1, t1 is in l1_3. p1 is initially in l1_3, hasn't been moved. So yes.

Effect: p1 is loaded into t1, no longer in l1_3.

3. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1:

Pre: t1 is in l1_3, l_from and l_to in c1. Yes.

Effect: t1 moves to l1_1.

4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1:

Pre: t1 is in l1_1, p1 is in t1. Yes.

Effect: p1 is in l1_1.

Thus, after these steps, p1 is in l1_1, p2 remains in l1_3. So the goal is achieved. And the plan is four actions long. Since each step is necessary, I don't think there's a shorter plan. For example, if the truck was already in l1_3, we could skip the first step, but in the initial state, t1 is in l1_4. So this is the minimal steps.
