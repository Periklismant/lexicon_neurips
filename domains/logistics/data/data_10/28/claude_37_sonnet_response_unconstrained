Let me understand the problem. We have two cities, c1 and c2, each with multiple locations, including airports l1_1 and l2_1. There are also trucks, airplanes, and packages. Trucks can move within cities, airplanes can move between airports, and both can carry packages.

Given the original state of the world and the goal, I need to find an optimal plan to achieve the following:
- Package p1 is in location l1_1
- Package p2 is in location l1_3

Let's first understand the current state of the world. I'll organize the information based on objects and their locations:

**Packages**:
- p1 is in location l1_3
- p2 is in location l1_3

**Trucks**:
- t1 is in location l1_4
- t2 is in location l2_3

**Airplanes**:
- a1 is in location l1_1
- a2 is in location l2_1

**Locations**:
- l1_1, l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5 are in city c1
- l2_1, l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5 are in city c2
- l1_1 and l2_1 are airports

Now, let's analyze the goal:
- We want p1 to be at l1_1 (currently at l1_3)
- We want p2 to remain at l1_3 (it's already there)

So, we need to move p1 from l1_3 to l1_1. Both locations are in city c1, so we can use a truck to transport p1 without needing an airplane. We have t1 at l1_4, so we first need to move t1 to l1_3, load p1, drive to l1_1, and unload.

Let's plan the steps:

1. Drive truck t1 from l1_4 to l1_3 in city c1
2. Load package p1 into truck t1 at l1_3
3. Drive truck t1 from l1_3 to l1_1 in city c1
4. Unload package p1 from truck t1 at l1_1

Package p2 is already at l1_3, so we don't need to do anything for it.

Let me check if there are any errors or if there's a more efficient way to do this. Since p2 is already at its destination, we only need to move p1. And the above plan seems to be the most direct way to do that, given that p1 and its destination are in the same city, and we have a truck in the same city.

One moment, I just noticed a potential issue with the current state of the world. It says:

"Package t1 is in location l1_4"
"Package t2 is in location l2_3"
"Package p1 is in location l1_3"
"Package p2 is in location l1_3"
"Package a1 is in location l1_1"
"Package a2 is in location l2_1"

This suggests that t1, t2, a1, and a2 are packages, not vehicles. But the rest of the problem description clearly indicates that t1, t2 are trucks and a1, a2 are airplanes. So I think those lines should actually be:

"Truck t1 is in location l1_4"
"Truck t2 is in location l2_3"
"Package p1 is in location l1_3"
"Package p2 is in location l1_3"
"Airplane a1 is in location l1_1"
"Airplane a2 is in location l2_1"

Let's proceed with this understanding.

So, our plan remains the same:

1. Drive truck t1 from l1_4 to l1_3 in city c1
2. Load package p1 into truck t1 at l1_3
3. Drive truck t1 from l1_3 to l1_1 in city c1
4. Unload package p1 from truck t1 at l1_1

This should achieve our goal efficiently.

Let me check the actions once more:

The drivetruck action is:
"drivetruck t l_from l_to c": Drive truck t from location l_from to location l_to in city c.

So, for our first action, we would write:
"drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1"

The loadtruck action is:
"loadtruck p t l": Load package p in truck t. Both p and t are in location l.

For our second action, we would write:
"loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3"

The drivetruck action for the third step:
"drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1"

And the unloadtruck action is:
"unloadtruck p t l": Unload package p from truck t in location l.

For our fourth action, we would write:
"unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1"

This plan should be optimal, as it achieves the goal in the minimum number of steps.

Oops, I just realized there's a small mistake in the action description. It says:

"loadairplane p ap l": Unload package p from airplane ap in location l.

This should actually be "unloadairplane p ap l". But this doesn't affect our plan since we're not using airplanes.

Let me double-check our plan:

1. "drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1"
2. "loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3"
3. "drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1"
4. "unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1"

This achieves our goal of having:
- Package p1 is in location l1_1
- Package p2 is in location l1_3 (it's already there)

And this plan is optimal because it uses the minimum number of actions to move p1 from l1_3 to l1_1.

Actually, let me think through this one more time:
- p1 is currently at l1_3 and we want to move it to l1_1.
- p2 is currently at l1_3 and we want it to stay there.
- t1 is at l1_4.

1. Move t1 from l1_4 to l1_3.
2. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_3.
3. Move t1 from l1_3 to l1_1.
4. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_1.

This is a valid and optimal plan. There's no need to use airplanes as the move is within the same city, and we're making use of the available truck to move the package in the most direct way possible. Using any other transport method or route would only make the plan longer.

So, I'm confident that the plan is:

```
drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
```
