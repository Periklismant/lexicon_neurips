Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. First, I need to understand the initial state, the goal, and all the constraints. 

The initial state has packages p1 and p2 in location l1_3, which is in city c1. The goal is to have p1 in l1_1 (which is an airport in c1) and p2 back in l1_3. But there are a bunch of constraints to satisfy along the way.

Looking at the constraints:

1. At some point, p1 must be in a1 (the airplane in l1_1).
2. p2 must be in l1_4, t1, t2, and l1_5 at different states.
3. One state must have either p2 in t2 or p1 in t2.
4. There's a constraint that if p1 is in l1_3 in some state, then p1 must be in l2_3 (in city c2) either then or later.
5. Also, a state where p2 is in t2 and p1 is in l2_3 must exist.
6. Another constraint requires p1 to be in l1_4 at some point.
7. Also, p1 must be either in a1 or l2_1 at some state.
8. And p2 must be in l1_5.

So, the plan needs to move p1 and p2 around, satisfying all these temporal constraints.

Starting with p1: The goal is to get it to l1_1. Since l1_1 is an airport, maybe using an airplane. But first, p1 is in l1_3. To get to the airport, perhaps use a truck. But which truck? The initial state says "Package t1 is in location l1_4" and "Package t2 is in location l2_3". Wait, no—the initial state probably lists where the trucks and airplanes are. Wait, looking back:

Wait, the original state says:

"Package t1 is in location l1_4" – but t1 is a truck. Wait, that must be a typo. Wait, the objects include "truck t1", "truck t2". So the original state probably says "Truck t1 is in location l1_4". Similarly for others. Let me check the original state again.

Wait, the user wrote:

Original state:

"Package t1 is in location l1_4"

But t1 is a truck. That's a mistake. Maybe a typo in the problem statement. Because trucks and airplanes are separate. Wait, the user probably meant:

"Truck t1 is in location l1_4"

Same for others. Because otherwise, if t1 is a package, that's conflicting. So assuming that's a typo, and the initial positions are:

Truck t1 is in l1_4.

Truck t2 is in l2_3.

Airplane a1 is in l1_1 (since "Package a1 is in location l1_1" – but a1 is an airplane, so probably "Airplane a1 is in location l1_1". So there's a mistake in the problem statement where "Package" is used instead of the correct type. But since the user provided the problem, I have to work with that. Wait, the user's original state lists:

"Package t1 is in location l1_4"

But t1 is a truck, not a package. So this must be an error. Similarly, "Package a1 is in location l1_1" – a1 is an airplane. So this is a problem in the problem statement. How to handle this?

Wait, the objects are defined as:

"package p1", "package p2", "truck t1", "truck t2", "airplane a1", "airplane a2".

So the original state entries:

"Package t1 is in location l1_4" – but t1 is a truck, so this is incorrect. So perhaps the correct initial state should have "Truck t1 is in location l1_4", "Truck t2 is in location l2_3", "Airplane a1 is in l1_1", "Airplane a2 is in l2_1". And the packages p1 and p2 are in l1_3. So that's probably the intended setup. The user made a typo in the original state by using "Package" instead of "Truck" or "Airplane". 

Assuming that, because otherwise, the problem is impossible. For example, t1 is a truck, so in the initial state, it's in l1_4. Similarly, a1 is an airplane in l1_1 (the airport of c1), and a2 in l2_1 (airport of c2). So that's the correct setup.

So, initial positions:

- t1 (truck) is in l1_4 (city c1).

- t2 (truck) is in l2_3 (city c2).

- a1 (airplane) is in l1_1 (c1's airport).

- a2 (airplane) is in l2_1 (c2's airport).

- Packages p1 and p2 are in l1_3 (city c1).

So, to get p1 to l1_1 (airport), perhaps we need to move it via truck to the airport, then load onto the airplane? But wait, the goal is for p1 to be in l1_1. But l1_1 is an airport. So maybe using a truck to drive from l1_3 to l1_1? Wait, but l1_1 is in city c1, so the truck can drive there. Wait, are the locations l1_1 to l1_5 all in c1? Yes. So the truck t1 is in l1_4. So maybe drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_3, load p1 and p2 into t1, then drive to l1_1. But wait, but the initial position of t1 is l1_4. So first, drive t1 to l1_3. Then load p1 and p2. Then drive to l1_1. Then unload p1 there. That would satisfy p1's goal. But p2's goal is to stay in l1_3, so that's a problem. Wait, the goal is p2 is in l1_3. But the initial state already has p2 in l1_3. So unless p2 is moved and then brought back. But according to the constraints, p2 must be in l1_4, t1, t2, l1_5, etc. So perhaps p2 is moved around and then brought back to l1_3.

But the goal requires p2 to be in l1_3. So maybe p2 is moved to other places (to satisfy constraints) and then returned to l1_3.

Let me list all the constraints again to make sure:

Constraints:

1. p1 is in a1 at some state.

2. p2 is in l1_4.

3. p2 is in t1.

4. p2 is in t2.

5. At least one of p2 in t2 or p1 in t2.

6. p1 is in l1_3 (but if this holds, then p1 must be in l2_3 at same or later state).

7. If p1 is in l1_3, then p1 must be in l2_3 at some point.

8. p1 is in l1_4.

9. At some state, p2 is in t2 and p1 is in l2_3.

10. p1 is in a1 or l2_1.

11. p2 is in l1_5.

So, these constraints must all be met in the plan.

First, the goal requires p1 in l1_1 and p2 in l1_3. So p2 must end up back in l1_3 after being moved.

Let's start with p1's path.

To get p1 to l1_1 (airport), possible steps:

- Load p1 into a truck (t1 or t2? But t2 is in city c2. So t1 is in c1. So maybe use t1.

But t1 is initially in l1_4. So first, drive t1 to l1_3 (p1's location). Then load p1 into t1. Then drive t1 to l1_1 (the airport). Then unload p1 there. But l1_1 is an airport, so once p1 is there, perhaps load it into a1 (the airplane) to satisfy constraint 1. Then unload it again back to l1_1. But the goal is to have p1 in l1_1. So maybe after loading into a1 and then unloading, it's back in l1_1. But why do we need to do that? Because constraint 1 requires p1 to be in a1 at some state. So we need to load p1 into a1, then unload it again.

But then, the steps would be:

For p1:

1. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_3.

2. Load p1 into t1 at l1_3.

3. Drive t1 to l1_1.

4. Unload p1 into l1_1.

But then, to get p1 into a1 (which is at l1_1), after unloading, we need to load it into a1. So after step 4, we have p1 in l1_1. Then load it into a1 (loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1). Then, perhaps unload it again (so it's back in l1_1). That way, the goal is still satisfied, and constraint 1 is met (p1 is in a1 at that state). But this adds steps. But since the plan must be optimal (shortest possible), maybe there's a way to combine this.

Alternatively, instead of unloading p1 at l1_1, perhaps load it directly into a1. Wait, but to load into a1, both the package and the airplane must be at the same location. So if p1 is in t1 at l1_1, then we can unload p1 into l1_1, then load into a1. Or, if the truck is in l1_1, unload p1 there, then load into a1.

But the problem is that after driving to l1_1, the truck is there. So steps:

Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_3 (pre: t1 is in l1_4, which it is initially).

Loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3.

Drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1. (Because l1_3 and l1_1 are in c1.)

Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1. Now p1 is in l1_1.

Then loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1. Now p1 is in a1. This satisfies constraint 1.

But then, to get p1 back to l1_1 (the goal), we need to unload it from a1. So unloadairplane p1 a1 l1_1. Now p1 is in l1_1 again.

So these steps would handle p1's movement and satisfy constraint 1.

Now, for p2's constraints. The goal is to have p2 in l1_3, which is where it starts. So we need to move p2 out and then back.

Constraints for p2:

- Must be in l1_4 (city c1, location l1_4), t1, t2 (truck in c2), l1_5, and in t2 at a state where p1 is in l2_3.

Also, there's a constraint that if p1 is in l1_3 (which is the initial state), then p1 must be in l2_3 at some point after. So p1 has to go to l2_3. But how? Because l2_3 is in city c2. So to get p1 to l2_3, which is in c2, we need to use an airplane. Because airplanes can fly between airports. So steps for p1 to reach l2_3:

After p1 is loaded into a1 at l1_1, fly a1 to l2_1 (the airport in c2). Then unload p1 in l2_1. Then use truck t2 (which is in l2_3) to move p1 to l2_3.

Wait, but t2 is in l2_3. So if we drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1 (but l2_1 is an airport in c2, and the other locations l2_2 to l2_5 are in c2). Wait, the cities c1 and c2 each have multiple locations, including an airport. So in c2, the airport is l2_1, and other locations l2_2, l2_3, etc. So, truck t2 is in l2_3. To get p1 from l2_1 (airport) to l2_3, we can drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1, load p1 into t2, then drive back to l2_3, unload. Then p1 is in l2_3.

But that would require several steps. Let's outline:

After p1 is in a1 at l1_1:

flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1.

unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1. Now p1 is in l2_1.

Then, drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1 (c2). Then load p1 into t2. Then drive back to l2_3. Unload p1 there. Now p1 is in l2_3.

But this would satisfy the constraint that if p1 is ever in l1_3 (which it is initially), then it must be in l2_3 at some point after. Since the initial state has p1 in l1_3, this condition is triggered. So even if we move p1 from l1_3 to other places, as long as we eventually get it to l2_3, that's okay.

But wait, the constraint is: if p1 is in l1_3 in some state s, then in s or a later state, p1 is in l2_3. So since in the initial state, p1 is in l1_3, we need to ensure that at some point p1 is in l2_3.

But according to the steps above, if we move p1 to l2_3, that would satisfy the constraint.

But perhaps there's a more efficient way. Alternatively, if during the plan, p1 is moved from l1_3 to other places, but never back to l1_3 except the initial state, then the initial state is the only time p1 is in l1_3, so the constraint requires that in that state or later, p1 is in l2_3. So moving p1 to l2_3 later would satisfy that.

So, let's integrate that into the plan.

Now, for p2's constraints:

- Must be in l1_4 (so need to move it there), t1 (so load into t1), t2 (so load into t2, which is in c2), l1_5.

Also, there's a constraint that p2 is in t2 and p1 is in l2_3 at the same state. So we need a state where both are true.

Additionally, p2 must be in l1_5 at some point.

So the plan must involve moving p2 through these locations and trucks.

Let's outline steps for p2:

Initial position: l1_3.

We need to:

1. Move p2 to l1_4 (constraint 2).

2. Load into t1 (constraint 3).

3. Load into t2 (constraint 4).

4. Move to l1_5 (constraint 11).

Also, p2 must be in t2 and p1 in l2_3 at the same state (constraint 9).

So perhaps during the process of moving p1 to l2_3, we have p2 in t2.

Let's think of the steps.

First, to get p2 into t2 (which is in c2), we need to get p2 to c2. Since trucks can't move between cities, but airplanes can. So to get p2 to c2, we need to load it into an airplane at l1_1 (airport in c1), fly to l2_1 (airport in c2), then load into t2.

But how to get p2 to l1_1? Let's see.

From l1_3, using truck t1 (which is in l1_4 initially):

- Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_3.

- Load p2 into t1.

- Drive t1 to l1_1.

- Unload p2 into l1_1.

Then load into airplane a1, fly to l2_1, unload p2 into l2_1, then drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1, load p2 into t2, then drive back to l2_3, unload. That would put p2 in l2_3. But we need p2 to be in t2 at some point. Wait, but if we load p2 into t2, that's done in l2_1. Then drive t2 to l2_3, then unload. So p2 is in t2 during the drive. But to satisfy the constraint that p2 is in t2, we can have it loaded into t2 in l2_1, then during the drive to l2_3, it's in t2. So the state after loading and before unloading would have p2 in t2.

But how to manage all these steps efficiently.

Also, note that p2's goal is to end up back in l1_3. So after moving it around, we need to return it.

This is getting complex. Let's try to outline the entire plan step by step, making sure all constraints are met.

First, handle p1:

1. Move t1 from l1_4 to l1_3 (drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1).

2. Load p1 into t1 (loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3).

3. Drive t1 to l1_1 (drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1).

4. Unload p1 into l1_1 (unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1).

5. Load p1 into a1 (loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1) → satisfies constraint 1.

6. Fly a1 to l2_1 (flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1).

7. Unload p1 into l2_1 (unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1).

8. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1 (drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2).

9. Load p1 into t2 (loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1) → this would satisfy constraint 5 (since p1 is in t2).

10. Drive t2 back to l2_3 (drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2).

11. Unload p1 into l2_3 (unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3) → now p1 is in l2_3, satisfying the conditional constraint (since it was in l1_3 initially, now it's in l2_3 after).

Now, for p2:

12. Now, p2 is initially in l1_3. Let's move it to l1_4 (constraint 2).

But t1 is now in l1_1. So:

13. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_3 (drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1).

14. Load p2 into t1 (loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3) → satisfies constraint 3 (p2 in t1).

15. Drive t1 to l1_4 (drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1).

16. Unload p2 into l1_4 → satisfies constraint 2.

17. Then, move p2 from l1_4 to l1_5 (constraint 11). So drive t1 to l1_5, but need to check if l1_4 and l1_5 are in the same city (yes, c1). So:

18. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1.

19. Load p2 into t1 again (since after unloading, p2 is in l1_4, then drive to l1_5 and unload? Or wait, after step 16, p2 is in l1_4. To get it to l1_5, drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_5, then load p2 (but p2 is in l1_4, not l1_5). Wait, that's a problem.

Wait, after step 16, p2 is in l1_4. To get it to l1_5, perhaps we need to use the same truck t1 again. So steps after step 16:

17. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_5 (drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1).

But then p2 is still in l1_4. So we need to pick it up first. So perhaps:

After step 16 (p2 in l1_4), we need to load p2 into t1 again:

17. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_4? No, t1 is in l1_4 after step 15. Wait, after step 15, t1 is in l1_4. So in step 16, unload p2 into l1_4. Then, to load p2 again, t1 is already in l1_4. So:

17. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (load p2 into t1 again).

18. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1.

19. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 → now p2 is in l1_5 (constraint 11 met).

Now, to get p2 into t2 (constraint 4), which is in c2. So we need to move p2 to c2. Let's see:

From l1_5, we need to get p2 to l1_1 (airport) to load into airplane a1.

But how to get p2 from l1_5 to l1_1:

20. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_1 (possible? Yes, since all locations in c1 are connected).

But t1 is in l1_5 after step 19. So:

20. Drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1.

21. Unload p2 from t1 (if p2 is still in t1). Wait, no. After step 19, p2 is unloaded into l1_5, so t1 is empty. So to move p2 from l1_5 to l1_1:

We need to load p2 into t1 at l1_5:

20. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5.

21. Drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1.

22. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 → p2 is in l1_1.

Now, load p2 into a1:

23. Loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1.

24. Fly a1 to l2_1 (but a1 is currently in l2_1 after step 6? Wait, step 6 was fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1. Then steps 7-11 involved a1 being in l2_1. So after that, a1 is still in l2_1. So to fly a1 back to l1_1, but we need to fly it again. Wait, in step 6, a1 was flown to l2_1. Then, after unloading p1, a1 is still there. So to move p2, we need to fly a1 back to l1_1. But p2 is in l1_1, which is the airport. Wait, no, after step 22, p2 is in l1_1. So to load it into a1, which is currently in l2_1. So that's a problem. So perhaps we need to fly a1 back to l1_1 first.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let's backtrack.

After step 11, p1 is in l2_3. Now, a1 is in l2_1 (from step 6). So to move p2 to c2, perhaps we can use a2, which is in l2_1. But p2 is in l1_5. So to get p2 to c2:

From l1_5, drive t1 to l1_5, load p2, drive to l1_1, unload. Then load into a1, fly to l2_1. Then unload, then load into t2, which is in l2_3. But a1 is already in l2_1 (from step 6). So steps:

20. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_5 (no, it's already there after step 19). Wait, after step 19, t1 is in l1_5. p2 is in l1_5.

So:

20. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5.

21. Drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1.

22. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

23. Loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1. But a1 is in l2_1. So can't load. Therefore, we need to fly a1 back to l1_1 first.

But a1 is in l2_1 after step 6. So:

Fly a1 from l2_1 to l1_1 (step 23: flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1).

24. Loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1.

25. Fly a1 back to l2_1 (flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1).

26. Unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1.

Then, drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1 (step 27: drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2).

28. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.

Now, p2 is in t2 (constraint 4 met). Then drive t2 back to l2_3:

29. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2.

30. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3.

But we need a state where p2 is in t2 and p1 is in l2_3. From step 11, p1 is in l2_3. So during step 28 (when p2 is loaded into t2) and after step 11 (p1 in l2_3), we can have a state where p2 is in t2 and p1 is in l2_3. Wait, after step 11, p1 is in l2_3. Then step 28 loads p2 into t2. So during step 28's load, p2 is in t2 and p1 is still in l2_3. That satisfies constraint 9.

But then, after unloading p2 into l2_3, we need to get it back to l1_3. Which is the goal. So how?

We need to move p2 from l2_3 back to c1. So again, using airplane a2 (which is in l2_1). Fly a2 to l2_3? No, airplanes can only land at airports. So to get p2 from l2_3 to c1, we need to:

- Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1.

- Load p2 into a2.

- Fly a2 to l1_1.

- Unload p2 into l1_1.

- Then drive t1 to l1_1, load p2, drive to l1_3, unload.

But this is getting very long. Let's see if we can find a shorter path.

Alternatively, after step 30, p2 is in l2_3. To get back to l1_3, we need to:

31. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1.

32. Load p2 into a2 (which is in l2_1).

33. Fly a2 to l1_1.

34. Unload p2 into l1_1.

35. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_3.

36. Load p2 into t1.

37. Drive t1 to l1_3.

38. Unload p2 into l1_3.

This would satisfy the goal of p2 in l1_3.

But this is a lot of steps. We need to check if all constraints are met.

Let's list all the constraints again and check which steps satisfy them:

1. p1 is in a1: Step 5 (loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1).

2. p2 in l1_4: Step 16.

3. p2 in t1: Steps 14 and 17.

4. p2 in t2: Step 28.

5. p2 in t2 or p1 in t2: Step 9 (p1 in t2) and step 28 (p2 in t2).

6. p1 in l1_3: Initially true, but the constraint is triggered here, requiring p1 to be in l2_3 later. Which is done in step 11.

7. If p1 is in l1_3 (initial state), then p1 must be in l2_3. Step 11 satisfies this.

8. p1 in l1_4: Wait, when is p1 in l1_4? The initial state has t1 in l1_4. But p1 is in l1_3. Unless during transportation. Hmm, this constraint requires p1 to be in l1_4 at some state. So we need to find a step where p1 is in l1_4.

But in the current plan, p1 is moved from l1_3 to l1_1 via truck. To get p1 into l1_4, maybe we need to detour.

Alternatively, after step 1, t1 is in l1_3. Then, after loading p1, drive t1 to l1_4 first. But that would add steps. Let's see:

Alternative steps for p1:

1. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_3.

2. Load p1 into t1.

3. Drive t1 to l1_4 (so p1 is in t1 in l1_4).

4. Unload p1 into l1_4 → satisfies constraint 8.

5. Load p1 again into t1.

6. Drive t1 to l1_1.

7. Unload p1 into l1_1.

Then proceed as before. This adds steps but satisfies constraint 8.

But this would make the plan longer. Since the user wants an optimal (shortest) plan, this might not be ideal. But if there's no other way, we have to include it.

Alternatively, can we find another way to get p1 into l1_4?

Another idea: After p1 is in l1_1, maybe move it back to l1_4 via truck. But that would require:

After step 4 (unload p1 in l1_1), drive t1 to l1_4, load p1, drive back. But why?

Alternatively, after step 4, p1 is in l1_1. To get to l1_4, drive t1 to l1_1, load p1, drive to l1_4, unload. But that's additional steps.

But this is necessary to satisfy constraint 8.

So perhaps, after step 4 (p1 in l1_1):

5. Loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1.

6. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1.

7. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4 → constraint 8 satisfied.

8. Then load p1 back into t1 and drive to l1_1 again.

But this adds steps, but maybe necessary.

But this would affect other steps. Let's rework the plan with this in mind.

Revised steps for p1:

1. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_3.

2. Load p1 into t1.

3. Drive t1 to l1_4 → p1 is now in t1 at l1_4.

4. Unload p1 into l1_4 → constraint 8 met.

5. Load p1 into t1 again.

6. Drive t1 to l1_1.

7. Unload p1 into l1_1.

8. Load into a1 (constraint 1).

9. Fly to l2_1.

10. Unload p1.

11. Drive t2 to l2_1, load p1, drive to l2_3, unload → p1 in l2_3.

Now, this adds steps but meets constraint 8.

But this increases the plan length. However, the user demands an optimal plan, so perhaps there's a way to satisfy constraint 8 without adding steps.

Wait, is there any other way p1 can be in l1_4? For example, if during the movement of p2, t1 is in l1_4 and p1 is there.

But initially, p1 is in l1_3. The only way for p1 to be in l1_4 is to be transported there. So perhaps the initial steps for p1 must include a stop in l1_4.

Thus, to satisfy constraint 8, the revised steps for p1 are necessary.

So, integrating that into the plan:

Steps for p1:

1. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1.

2. Loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3.

3. Drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1.

4. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4 → constraint 8 met.

5. Loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4.

6. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1.

7. Unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1.

8. Loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 → constraint 1 met.

9. Flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1.

10. Unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1.

11. Drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2.

12. Loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1.

13. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2.

14. Unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 → constraint 9 (since p2 will be in t2 later) and satisfies the conditional constraint.

Now, for p2's steps:

Initial position: l1_3.

15. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1 (after step 7, t1 is in l1_1).

16. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 → constraint 3 met.

17. Drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1.

18. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 → constraint 2 met.

19. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4.

20. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1.

21. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 → constraint 11 met.

22. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5.

23. Drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1.

24. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

25. Flyairplane a1 l2_1 l1_1 → fly a1 back to l1_1 to transport p2.

26. Loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1.

27. Flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1.

28. Unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1.

29. Drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2 (but t2 is in l2_3 after step 14).

30. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 → constraint 4 met.

31. Drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2.

32. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3.

Now, during step 30, p2 is in t2 and p1 is in l2_3 (from step 14), satisfying constraint 9.

Also, constraint 5 (p2 in t2 or p1 in t2) is met in step 12 (p1 in t2) and step 30 (p2 in t2).

Now, to return p2 to l1_3:

33. Flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 → a2 is initially in l2_1.

34. Loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 → but p2 is in l2_3 after step 32. So this approach won't work.

Wait, after step 32, p2 is in l2_3. To get it back to c1, we need to:

33. Drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2.

34. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.

35. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.

36. Loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1.

37. Flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

38. Unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1.

39. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1.

40. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

41. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1.

42. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 → goal met.

But this is adding even more steps. However, the user wants an optimal plan, so perhaps there's a shorter way.

Wait, perhaps after step 32 (p2 in l2_3), we can use airplane a2 to fly to l2_1, but a2 is already there. Wait, initial position of a2 is l2_1. So steps:

33. Drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2.

34. Loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.

35. Unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 → p2 in l2_1.

36. Loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1.

37. Flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

38. Unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1.

39. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1.

40. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

41. Drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_3 c1.

42. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3.

This is getting very long. But perhaps there's a more efficient path.

Alternatively, after step 32 (p2 in l2_3), drive t2 back to l2_1, load p2 into a2, fly to l1_1, then use t1 to bring back to l1_3.

But this is necessary.

But given all these steps, the plan is becoming very long, which contradicts the requirement for an optimal (shortest) plan.

Is there a way to satisfy all constraints with fewer steps?

Let's re-examine the constraints:

- The constraint that p1 is in l1_3 initially triggers the requirement for p1 to be in l2_3 later. That's satisfied in step 14.

- The constraint that p1 is in a1 (step 8).

- p2 must be in l1_4 (step 18), t1 (step 16), t2 (step 30), l1_5 (step 21).

- The constraint that p2 is in t2 and p1 is in l2_3 (step 30 and step 14).

- p1 must be in l1_4 (step 4).

- p1 must be in a1 or l2_1: step 8 (a1) and step 10 (l2_1), so that's covered.

- p2 must be in l1_5 (step 21).

- The constraint that after p1 is in l1_3 (initially), it's in l2_3 later (step 14).

Now, the problem is to find the shortest path that covers all these.

Let's try to find a more optimal path.

Alternative approach:

Use airplanes for both p1 and p2 to minimize steps.

For p1:

- Load into truck t1, drive to l1_1, load into a1, fly to l2_1, unload, load into t2, drive to l2_3, unload. This gets p1 to l2_3.

For p2:

- Load into truck t1, drive to l1_4 (satisfy constraint 2), unload (constraint 2), load again, drive to l1_1, load into a1, fly to l2_1, unload, load into t2 (constraint 4), drive to l2_3, unload.

Then, to get p2 back, fly a2 to l2_1, load p2, fly to l1_1, unload, load into t1, drive to l1_3.

But this seems similar to the previous plan.

Alternatively, can we have p2 in t2 and p1 in l2_3 at the same time?

Yes, when p1 is unloaded into l2_3 (step 14), and p2 is loaded into t2 (step 30), but these are separate steps. Unless we can do them in parallel.

But in planning, actions are sequential. So the state after step 14 has p1 in l2_3. Then, after step 30, p2 is in t2 and p1 is still in l2_3. So that state satisfies constraint 9.

Now, considering all constraints, perhaps the minimal steps are:

1. Move t1 to l1_3, load p1 and p2.

2. Drive to l1_4, unload p1 (meet constraint 8), then reload.

3. Drive to l1_1, unload p1.

4. Load p1 into a1 (constraint 1).

5. Fly a1 to l2_1.

6. Unload p1.

7. Drive t2 to l2_1, load p1, drive to l2_3, unload (p1 in l2_3).

8. For p2: from l1_1, load into a1, fly to l2_1.

9. Unload p2, load into t2 (constraint 4).

10. Drive t2 to l2_3, unload.

11. Fly a2 to l2_1, load p2, fly to l1_1.

12. Unload, load into t1, drive to l1_3, unload.

But this seems to miss some constraints, like p2 in l1_5.

Alternatively, perhaps p2 needs to be taken to l1_5 via t1 after being in l1_4.

This is getting too convoluted. To ensure all constraints are met with minimal steps, perhaps the initial plan I outlined needs to be followed, even if it's longer, but maybe there's a smarter way.

Another idea: Use the fact that p2 starts in l1_3. To meet constraint 11 (p2 in l1_5), we can drive t1 to l1_3, load p2, drive to l1_5, unload. Then back to l1_3. But this would require:

1. Drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1.

2. Loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3.

3. Drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_5 c1.

4. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 → constraint 11 met.

5. Drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1.

6. Unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3.

But this doesn't help with other constraints like p2 in t2.

Alternatively, combine movements for p1 and p2.

But time is limited, so perhaps the best way is to outline the steps as per the initial plan, ensuring all constraints are met, even if it's longer, and then check for optimality.

The final plan must include all required steps and satisfy all constraints. Given the complexity, I'll proceed to write out the plan with the necessary steps, ensuring each constraint is met.
