I'll solve this logistics planning problem step by step, ensuring all constraints are satisfied while finding an optimal plan.

First, let me analyze the initial state and goal:
- Initial state: p1 and p2 are in l1_3, t1 is in l1_4, t2 is in l2_3, a1 is in l1_1, a2 is in l2_1
- Goal: p1 in l1_1, p2 in l1_3

Let me also analyze the constraints to ensure they're all satisfied in my plan:
1. p1 must be in a1 at some point
2. p2 must be in l1_4 at some point
3. p2 must be in t1 at some point
4. p2 must be in t2 at some point
5. Either p2 or p1 must be in t2 at some point
6. p1 must be in l1_3 at some point (satisfied initially)
7. If p1 is in l1_3, it must later be in l2_3
8. p1 must be in l1_4 at some point
9. p2 must be in t2 while p1 is in l2_3 at some point
10. p1 must be in a1 or in l2_1 at some point
11. p2 must be in l1_5 at some point

Here's my optimal plan:

```
drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1
loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_4 c1
unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_5 c1

drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1

loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
loadtruck p2 t2 l1_4
drivetruck t2 l2_3 l1_4 c2
drivetruck t2 l1_4 l1_3 c1
unloadtruck p2 t2 l1_3
