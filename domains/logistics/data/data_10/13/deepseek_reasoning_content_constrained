Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. The goal is to get p1 to l1_2 and p2 to l2_5, but there are a bunch of constraints to satisfy along the way. Let's start by understanding the initial state and the required conditions.

First, initial state:

- Packages:
  - p1 is at l1_4 (city c1)
  - p2 is at l1_1 (c1's airport)
  - a1 is at l1_1 (c1's airport)
  - a2 is at l2_1 (c2's airport)
  - Trucks t1 is at l1_2 (c1), t2 at l2_3 (c2)

The goal is p1 at l1_2 and p2 at l2_5.

Constraints are numerous. Let's list them:

1. p1 must be in l2_5 at least once.
2. At least one state where p2 is in a2 OR p1 is in l2_5.
3. At least one state where p2 is in l1_5 or l2_2.
4. At least one state where p1 is in l1_4.
5. If p1 is in l1_4 in state s, then p2 must be in l2_1 in s or after.
6. At least one state where p2 is in l2_1.
7. If p2 is in l2_1, there must be an earlier state where p2 was in l1_5.
8. At least one state where p1 is in a2.
9. At least one state where p1 is in l2_2.
10. At least one state where p2 is in a2 AND p1 is in l2_4.
11. At least one state where p1 is in l2_3 and p2 in l2_2.
12. At least one state where p2 is in l1_3.

Wow, that's a lot. Let's see how to satisfy all these.

First, the main goal: p1 needs to end at l1_2 (c1) and p2 at l2_5 (c2). Let's plan the main steps and then see how the constraints fit in.

For p1: It starts at l1_4 (c1). To get to l1_2, which is in the same city. So maybe use truck t1, which is at l1_2. Wait, wait: initial state says "Package t1 is in location l1_2". Wait, no, wait the original state says "Package t1 is in location l1_2". Wait, that might be a typo. Wait the user wrote:

Original state:

"Package t1 is in location l1_2"

But t1 is a truck. So that's a mistake. Probably a typo. Because earlier, the objects include "truck t1", "truck t2". So the original state probably has "Truck t1 is in location l1_2". Otherwise, if t1 is a package, that's conflicting. So assuming that's a typo, the initial positions are:

Truck t1 is at l1_2 (c1), truck t2 at l2_3 (c2).

So, for p1 at l1_4 (c1), to get to l1_2 (c1), perhaps use truck t1. But t1 is at l1_2. So the truck needs to drive to l1_4, load p1, then drive back to l1_2 and unload. That would be straightforward. But let's check the constraints.

But wait, there are constraints that require p1 to be in l2_5 (constraint 1). But the final goal is p1 at l1_2. So how can that be? Wait, the goal is p1 in l1_2 and p2 in l2_5, but constraint 1 says p1 must be in l2_5 at least once. So we need to have p1 reach l2_5 at some point and then bring it back to l1_2. That complicates things. So p1's journey must involve moving to l2_5 and then back to l1_2.

Similarly, p2 starts at l1_1 (c1's airport). To get to l2_5 (c2's city), which is a non-airport location in c2. So p2 needs to be transported from c1 to c2. Since airplanes can fly between airports. So possible steps: load p2 into airplane a1 (which is at l1_1), fly a1 to l2_1 (c2's airport), unload p2 there, then use truck t2 (which is at l2_3) to drive to l2_1, load p2 into t2, drive to l2_5, and unload.

But there are constraints that complicate this. For example, constraint 7 says that if p2 is in l2_1 (which is needed for the final plan), there must be an earlier state where p2 was in l1_5. But l1_5 is in c1. So p2 has to go from l1_1 to l1_5, then to l2_1 somehow. How?

Wait, p2 starts at l1_1. To get to l1_5, which is in c1. So using a truck. But trucks can move within the same city. The trucks in c1 are t1 (at l1_2). So maybe drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1, load p2 into t1, drive to l1_5, unload. Then, from l1_5, how to get to l2_1? That requires an airplane. So p2 would need to be moved from l1_5 to an airport in c1 (l1_1), loaded into an airplane (a1), flown to l2_1, then handled in c2.

But this adds steps. Let's check constraints.

Constraint 3: p2 must be in l1_5 or l2_2 at some point. If we take p2 to l1_5, that satisfies part of this constraint. Then, after that, moving p2 via airplane to c2, then maybe to l2_2 (using truck t2), which would cover the other part. But perhaps we can satisfy this with one of the two.

Constraint 7: If p2 is in l2_1 (which it will be when we unload from the airplane), there must be an earlier state where p2 was in l1_5. So that's why we need to take p2 to l1_5 first.

So steps for p2:

1. Move p2 from l1_1 to l1_5 using truck t1.

But t1 is at l1_2. So drive t1 to l1_1, load p2, drive to l1_5, unload.

Then, from l1_5, need to get p2 to an airport (l1_1) to fly to c2. So use truck t1 again: drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_1, load p2 into a1, fly a1 to l2_1. Then in c2, unload p2 from a1 into truck t2 (but t2 is at l2_3; need to drive t2 to l2_1 to pick up p2, then drive to l2_5.

But this is getting complicated. Let's outline possible steps for both packages.

For p1:

Starts at l1_4 (c1). Need to reach l1_2 (c1) as the final goal. But must also pass through l2_5 (c2) due to constraint 1. So p1 needs to go from c1 to c2 and back. How?

To move between cities, p1 would need to be flown. So steps could be:

- Load p1 into truck t1 (which is at l1_2). Wait, p1 is at l1_4. So truck t1 needs to drive to l1_4. But t1 is at l1_2. So drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_4, load p1, then drive to l1_1 (the airport), unload p1, load into airplane a1, fly to l2_1 (c2's airport), unload p1 into truck t2 (drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1), load p1 into t2, drive to l2_5, unload (satisfying constraint 1). Then, to get p1 back to c1's l1_2, need to reverse: load into airplane a2 (if available?), but a2 is at l2_1. So fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1, then truck t1 to l1_1, load, drive to l1_2.

But that's a lot. Let's check if that's necessary.

But the final goal requires p1 to be back at l1_2, so after being in l2_5, it must return. That's a lot of steps, but necessary.

For p2:

Start at l1_1 (c1's airport). Need to go to l2_5 (c2). But to satisfy constraint 7, p2 must be in l1_5 before being in l2_1. So steps:

1. Use truck t1 to move p2 from l1_1 to l1_5.

But how? p2 is at l1_1. Truck t1 is at l1_2. Drive t1 to l1_1, load p2, drive to l1_5, unload. Then, to get p2 to l2_1, need to move it back to l1_1 (airport). So drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_1, load p2 into a1, fly a1 to l2_1. Then in c2, truck t2 (at l2_3) drives to l2_1, load p2, drive to l2_5, unload.

But let's also consider the constraints along the way.

Constraints to satisfy:

- Constraint 4: p1 is in l1_4. That's its initial position. So the initial state satisfies this. But the problem says the original state is as given, so the initial state has p1 in l1_4. So constraint 4 is already satisfied. However, the constraint says "must hold in at least one state". Since the initial state is a state, that's already covered. So no action needed for that.

But then, constraint 5 says that if p1 is in l1_4 in some state s (which is the initial state), then p2 must be in l2_1 in s or after. So in the initial state, p2 is not in l2_1. So after s, p2 must reach l2_1. Which it does when we fly it to l2_1.

Constraint 6: p2 must be in l2_1 at least once. Which it will be when unloaded from the airplane.

Constraint 7: If p2 is in l2_1, there must be an earlier state where p2 was in l1_5. Which is satisfied by moving p2 to l1_5 first.

Constraint 8: p1 must be in a2. a2 is the airplane in l2_1 (c2's airport). So to get p1 into a2, perhaps during its journey to l2_5. So after flying to l2_1, maybe load p1 into a2, then fly back? But why would that happen? Alternatively, after unloading p1 from a1 in l2_1, maybe load it into a2 and fly somewhere else. But that's extra steps.

Constraint 9: p1 must be in l2_2. So during its journey in c2, maybe after being in l2_5, but need to get it to l2_2. Not sure yet.

Constraint 10: At least one state where p2 is in a2 and p1 is in l2_4. Hmm. So p2 in a2 (which is at l2_1, since a2's initial location is l2_1). But p1 in l2_4 (c2). So maybe during the process of moving p1 through c2.

Constraint 11: p1 in l2_3 and p2 in l2_2. So need to have both packages in c2 at some point.

Constraint 12: p2 must be in l1_3. But in the initial plan, p2 is moved from l1_1 to l1_5, then to l1_1 again. So perhaps need to take a detour through l1_3. That complicates things.

This is getting really complex. Let's try to outline a possible plan step by step, making sure all constraints are met.

First, handle p2's constraints:

- Must go to l1_5 (for constraint 7).
- Must go to l1_3 (constraint 12).
- Then to l2_1 via airplane.

But moving p2 from l1_1 to l1_3 and then l1_5. Let's see. Maybe use truck t1:

1. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1 (current location is l1_2).
2. Load p2 into t1 at l1_1.
3. Drive t1 to l1_3 (city c1).
4. Unload p2 at l1_3 (satisfies constraint 12).
5. Load p2 again into t1 at l1_3.
6. Drive t1 to l1_5 (city c1).
7. Unload p2 at l1_5 (satisfies constraint 3 and 7).
8. Now, need to get p2 to l1_1 (airport) to load into airplane a1.
   - Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_1.
9. Load p2 into a1 at l1_1.
10. Fly a1 to l2_1 (c2's airport).
11. Unload p2 from a1 into l2_1.
12. Now, in c2, use truck t2 to move p2 to l2_5.
    - Truck t2 is at l2_3. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1.
13. Load p2 into t2 at l2_1.
14. Drive t2 to l2_5.
15. Unload p2 at l2_5 (final goal).

But during this process, we need to satisfy other constraints.

Now for p1:

Starts at l1_4. Needs to reach l1_2 eventually but also must be in l2_5 (constraint 1). Also, constraints 8 (p1 in a2), 9 (l2_2), 10 (p2 in a2 and p1 in l2_4), 11 (p1 in l2_3 and p2 in l2_2).

So p1's journey:

- From l1_4, need to get to l2_5, then back to l1_2.

Possible steps:

1. Use truck t1 (but t1 is busy moving p2). Alternatively, use another truck. Wait, the trucks are t1 (c1) and t2 (c2). So in c1, only t1. So to move p1 from l1_4:

a. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_4. Wait, but earlier steps for p2 have t1 moving to l1_1, then to l1_3, then l1_5, then back to l1_1. So t1 is occupied with p2's transport. So maybe need to interleave actions.

This complicates things because t1 can't be in two places at once. So we need to sequence the movement of t1 to handle both p1 and p2.

Alternative approach: handle p1 after moving p2 to l1_5 and l1_3. Let's see:

After step 7 (p2 is at l1_5), t1 is at l1_5. Then steps 8: drive t1 to l1_1. But perhaps before that, use t1 to move p1.

Wait, initial state: p1 is at l1_4. To move p1, we need to use t1. But t1 is moving p2 around. So perhaps the plan needs to first handle p2's movement to l1_5 and l1_3, then use t1 to move p1.

But let's outline:

For p2:

1. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1. (t1 now at l1_1)
2. Load p2 into t1. (p2 in t1)
3. Drive t1 to l1_3. (t1 at l1_3)
4. Unload p2. (p2 at l1_3 → satisfies constraint 12)
5. Load p2 again into t1. (p2 in t1)
6. Drive t1 to l1_5. (t1 at l1_5)
7. Unload p2. (p2 at l1_5 → satisfies constraint 3 and 7)
8. Now, need to get p2 to l1_1. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_1. (t1 at l1_1)
9. Unload p2 from t1 (but wait, p2 was unloaded at l1_5, so after step 7, p2 is at l1_5. So step 8 is drive t1 to l1_1, then load p2 into t1 again? Wait, no. After step 7, p2 is at l1_5. So to get p2 to l1_1, need to load it back into t1 at l1_5.

So:

8. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_5 (no, can't). Wait, t1 is at l1_5 after step 6. After unloading p2 (step7), p2 is at l1_5, t1 is at l1_5.

So to move p2 from l1_5 to l1_1:

8. Load p2 into t1 at l1_5.
9. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_1.
10. Unload p2 at l1_1. Now p2 is back at l1_1. Then load into airplane a1.

But this seems inefficient, but necessary.

Now, during this time, p1 is still at l1_4. So after step 10 (p2 at l1_1), we can use t1 to handle p1.

But let's proceed with p2 first:

11. Load p2 into a1 at l1_1.
12. Fly a1 to l2_1.
13. Unload p2 into l2_1. Now, p2 is at l2_1. Which satisfies constraint 6 and part of constraint 5 (since after initial state, p2 reaches l2_1).

Then, in c2:

14. Drive truck t2 from l2_3 to l2_1.
15. Load p2 into t2.
16. Drive t2 to l2_5.
17. Unload p2 → goal achieved.

But during this, what about p1?

p1 needs to go from l1_4 to l1_2, but also pass through l2_5. So:

After step 10 (p2 is unloaded at l1_1), t1 is at l1_1. But after that, step 11 is loading p2 into a1. Then fly a1 to l2_1.

Now, t1 is free to move p1:

After step 10 (unload p2 at l1_1), before loading into a1, perhaps:

But no, the steps for p2 would be:

After unloading p2 at l1_1 (step10), then load p2 into a1 (step11). So during that time, t1 is at l1_1.

So after step 10, t1 is at l1_1. Then we can use t1 to move p1:

18. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_4. (p1 is at l1_4)
19. Load p1 into t1.
20. Drive t1 to l1_1.
21. Unload p1 into l1_1.
22. Load p1 into a1 (which is at l1_1).
23. Fly a1 to l2_1.
24. Unload p1 into l2_1.

But wait, a1 was used to fly p2 to l2_1. So steps would be:

After step 12 (a1 flies to l2_1 with p2), a1 is at l2_1. So to fly p1, we need another airplane. But the airplanes are a1 and a2. a2 is at l2_1 initially. So maybe use a2 to fly p1 back.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let's re-examine.

After p2 is in l2_1 (step13), a1 is at l2_1. Now, to get p1 to c2, perhaps use a2. But a2 is initially at l2_1. To use a2 to transport p1, we need to fly a2 to c1 first.

But a2 starts at l2_1. So steps could be:

- Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
- Load p1 into a2.
- Fly back to l2_1.

But why? Because p1 needs to get to l2_5 and then back to l1_2.

Alternatively, after moving p1 to l1_1 via truck t1, load into a1 (but a1 is in l2_1 after step12). So a1 is not available. Hence, need to use a2.

So steps for p1:

After p2 is handled (up to step17):

Wait, but p1's movement needs to happen while p2 is being moved. This is getting very intertwined.

Alternative plan for p1:

1. After p2 is moved to l1_5 and then to l1_1, use t1 to move p1:

- Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_4 (step18).
- Load p1 into t1 (step19).
- Drive t1 to l1_1 (step20).
- Unload p1 into l1_1 (step21).
- Load p1 into a2 (but a2 is at l2_1). Wait, no, a2 is at l2_1 initially. So to use a2 to carry p1, need to have a2 fly to l1_1 first.

So steps:

- Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
- Load p1 into a2.
- Fly a2 back to l2_1.
- Unload p1 into l2_1.
- Then, use truck t2 (which is in c2) to move p1 from l2_1 to l2_5 (but the goal is to have p1 in l2_5 at some point, then back to l1_2).

But this requires a lot of steps. Let's outline:

Steps after p2 is at l2_5 (step17):

Now, need to handle p1's journey.

- Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1. (a2 was at l2_1, now in l1_1)
- Load p1 into a2.
- Fly a2 back to l2_1. Now p1 is in l2_1.
- Unload p1 into l2_1.
- Drive truck t2 from l2_5 (where p2 was unloaded) to l2_1 (but t2 was used to move p2 to l2_5, so after step17, t2 is at l2_5. Need to drive back to l2_1 to pick up p1. So:

- Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1.
- Load p1 into t2.
- Drive t2 to l2_5. Unload p1 (satisfies constraint1).
- Then, to get p1 back to c1's l1_2: load into a2 (which is at l2_1?), fly to l1_1, unload, load into t1, drive to l1_2.

This is getting too long. Let's see if we can optimize.

But maybe we can combine some steps. For example, when a2 flies to l1_1 to pick up p1, after that, fly to l2_1, unload, then use truck t2 to move p1 to l2_5. Then fly back to c1.

But also, we need to satisfy constraints like p1 must be in a2 (constraint8), which would be achieved when p1 is loaded into a2.

Also, constraint9: p1 must be in l2_2. So after unloading from a2 into l2_1, perhaps drive t2 to l2_2, unload p1 there (satisfies constraint9), then reload and drive to l2_5.

Similarly, constraint10: p2 in a2 and p1 in l2_4. So need to have p2 loaded into a2 at some point. But p2 is supposed to end up in l2_5. So perhaps during the process, load p2 into a2, then unload. But how?

Wait, a2 is at l2_1. After p2 is unloaded at l2_1 (step13), perhaps load p2 into a2 and then unload again. But why? To satisfy constraint10, which requires p2 in a2 and p1 in l2_4.

So possible steps:

After step13 (p2 at l2_1):

14. Load p2 into a2 (at l2_1).
15. Now, p2 is in a2. Then, unload p2 back to l2_1 (maybe? But this seems redundant). But then, constraint10 also requires p1 to be in l2_4. So during p1's journey, after being in l2_1, drive to l2_4.

So steps for p1:

- After being unloaded from a2 into l2_1 (assuming a2 carried p1 there), drive t2 to l2_1, load p1, drive to l2_4, unload (satisfies part of constraint10: p1 in l2_4 and p2 in a2 (step14)). Then, reload p1 into t2 and drive to l2_5.

This way, during step14 and step of p1 in l2_4, constraint10 is satisfied.

But this adds more steps. This is getting very complex. Let's try to outline all necessary actions, ensuring all constraints are met.

Final plan outline:

1. Move p2 from l1_1 to l1_3 using t1.
2. Move p2 from l1_3 to l1_5.
3. Move p2 back to l1_1, load into a1, fly to l2_1.
4. Move p2 from l2_1 to l2_5 via t2.
5. For p1:
   a. Move from l1_4 to l1_1 via t1.
   b. Load into a2, fly to l2_1.
   c. Move via t2 to l2_5 (to satisfy constraint1).
   d. Then fly back to c1 and move to l1_2.
6. Along the way, ensure other constraints are met by appropriate steps.

But given the time constraints, perhaps the optimal plan would involve:

- p1 being loaded into a2 at some point (constraint8).
- p1 passing through l2_2 and l2_4 (constraint9,10).
- p2 passing through l1_5 and l2_2.

This requires a very detailed plan. Considering the time, I'll try to draft a possible plan, ensuring all constraints are hit.

Proposed steps:

For p2:

1. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1.
2. Load p2 into t1.
3. Drive t1 to l1_3 (p2 in l1_3: constraint12).
4. Unload p2.
5. Load p2 into t1.
6. Drive t1 to l1_5.
7. Unload p2 (constraint3 and 7).
8. Load p2 into t1.
9. Drive t1 to l1_1.
10. Unload p2.
11. Load p2 into a1.
12. Fly a1 to l2_1.
13. Unload p2 into l2_1 (constraint6 and 5).
14. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_1.
15. Load p2 into t2.
16. Drive t2 to l2_2 (constraint3 and 11).
17. Unload p2 (now in l2_2: part of constraint11).
18. Load p2 into t2.
19. Drive t2 to l2_5.
20. Unload p2 (final goal).

For p1:

21. Drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_4 (after step9, t1 is at l1_1).
22. Load p1 into t1.
23. Drive t1 to l1_1.
24. Unload p1.
25. Load p1 into a2.
26. Fly a2 to l2_1 (constraint8: p1 in a2).
27. Unload p1 into l2_1.
28. Drive t2 from l2_5 (after step20) to l2_1 (but t2 is at l2_5; need to return. So after step20, drive t2 back to l2_1).
29. Load p1 into t2.
30. Drive t2 to l2_4 (constraint10).
31. Unload p1 (now in l2_4, and if p2 was loaded into a2 earlier, but p2 is already in l2_5. Hmm, conflict here. To satisfy constraint10: p2 in a2 and p1 in l2_4. So need to have p2 in a2 at the same time p1 is in l2_4. How?

Alternative approach: before moving p2 to l2_5, after step13 (p2 in l2_1), load p2 into a2 (which is at l2_1), then unload. So:

After step13:

14. Load p2 into a2 (now p2 is in a2: part of constraint10).
15. Now, drive t2 to l2_1.
16. Load p2 into t2.
17. Drive to l2_2, unload (constraint11).
18. Drive to l2_5, unload (final goal).

Meanwhile, for p1:

19. After step25, fly a2 (now with p1) to l2_1.
20. Unload p1.
21. Drive t2 to l2_4, unload p1 (constraint10: p1 in l2_4 and p2 in a2 (step14)).

But this is getting too tangled. I think this requires a more systematic approach, but given time constraints, I'll try to draft the plan with the necessary steps to hit all constraints.
