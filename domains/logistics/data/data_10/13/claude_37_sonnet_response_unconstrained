In this logistics planning problem, I need to find an optimal plan to move packages p1 and p2 to specific locations. Let's first understand the initial state and the goal state:

Initial state:
- Location l1_1 through l1_5 are in city c1
- Location l2_1 through l2_5 are in city c2
- t1 is in location l1_2 (seems like a typo in the problem statement, treating this as truck t1)
- t2 is in location l2_3 (seems like a typo, treating this as truck t2)
- p1 is in location l1_4
- p2 is in location l1_1
- a1 is in location l1_1 (seems like a typo, treating this as airplane a1)
- a2 is in location l2_1 (seems like a typo, treating this as airplane a2)

Goal state:
- p1 is in location l1_2
- p2 is in location l2_5

I need to move packages to their target locations using the available actions. Let's develop a plan:

For p1:
- p1 is currently at l1_4 in city c1
- We need to move it to l1_2 which is also in city c1
- We can use truck t1 which is at l1_2

For p2:
- p2 is currently at l1_1 in city c1
- We need to move it to l2_5 which is in city c2
- We need to transport it across cities, so we'll need an airplane
- a1 is at l1_1, which is convenient for p2's current location
- We'll need to fly to l2_1 (the airport in city c2)
- Then use truck t2 to transport p2 from l2_1 to l2_5

Let's develop the plan step by step:

For p1:
1. Drive truck t1 from l1_2 to l1_4 (where p1 is located)
2. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_4
3. Drive t1 from l1_4 back to l1_2
4. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_2

For p2:
1. Load p2 onto airplane a1 at l1_1 (both are already there)
2. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1
3. Unload p2 from a1 at l2_1
4. Drive truck t2 from l2_3 to l2_1
5. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_1
6. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_5
7. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_5

Now let's combine these into a sequential plan, as some steps might depend on the completion of others:

Wait, I see there might be some confusion in the problem statement. The initial state says:
- "Package t1 is in location l1_2"
- "Package t2 is in location l2_3"
- "Package a1 is in location l1_1"
- "Package a2 is in location l2_1"

However, t1 and t2 should be trucks, and a1 and a2 should be airplanes, not packages. Let me restate the initial configuration based on the domain description:

Initial state:
- Location l1_1 through l1_5 are in city c1
- Location l2_1 through l2_5 are in city c2
- Truck t1 is in location l1_2
- Truck t2 is in location l2_3
- Package p1 is in location l1_4
- Package p2 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

Now, let's redo the plan:

For p1:
1. Drive truck t1 from l1_2 to l1_4
2. Load p1 onto t1 at l1_4
3. Drive t1 from l1_4 back to l1_2
4. Unload p1 from t1 at l1_2

For p2:
1. Load p2 onto airplane a1 at l1_1
2. Fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1
3. Unload p2 from a1 at l2_1
4. Drive truck t2 from l2_3 to l2_1
5. Load p2 onto t2 at l2_1
6. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_5
7. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_5

Let's make this plan more formal:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
3. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
5. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
6. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
7. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
8. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
9. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
10. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
11. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5

Wait, I see an issue in my action descriptions. The action "loadairplane" is used for both loading and unloading in the problem description. Let me check the correct action names:

For loading a package into an airplane:
- "loadairplane p ap l": Load package p in airplane ap. Both p and ap are in location l.

For unloading a package from an airplane:
- "loadairplane p ap l": Unload package p from airplane ap in location l.

This seems like a typo in the problem description. The unload action for an airplane should probably be "unloadairplane". Let me assume this is the case.

Corrected plan:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
3. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
5. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
6. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
7. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
8. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
9. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
10. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
11. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5

Checking for optimality:
For p1, we use 4 actions to move it from l1_4 to l1_2, which is minimal given the constraints.
For p2, we use 7 actions to move it from l1_1 to l2_5, which also seems minimal given that we need to use both an airplane and a truck to cross cities.

So, the total number of actions in our plan is 11, which appears to be optimal for this problem.

Looking at the plan again:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
3. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
5. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
6. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
7. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
8. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
9. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
10. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
11. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5

Actually, I need to double check the actions for unloadairplane, because it's still inconsistent in the problem description:

For unloadairplane, the problem description has:
- "loadairplane p ap l": Unload package p from airplane ap in location l.
But then in the effects section, it refers to:
- "unloadairplane": After unloading a package p from an airplane ap in a location l...

Given the context and the format of other actions, I'm confident the correct action name should be "unloadairplane". I'll use that in the final plan.

Final plan:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
3. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
5. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
6. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
7. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
8. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
9. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
10. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
11. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
