Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. So, the goal is to get p1 to l2_3 and p2 to l2_2. But there are a bunch of constraints we need to satisfy along the way. Let me start by understanding the initial state and all the constraints.

First, the initial state:
- p1 is in l2_3. Wait, the goal says p1 should be in l2_3. So that's already satisfied. Wait, no. Let me check again. Wait, original state says "Package p1 is in location l2_3". Wait, the goal is to have "Package p1 is in location l2_3" and "Package p2 is in location l2_2". So p1 is already where it needs to be. So the main task is to get p2 to l2_2. But wait, the original state says "Package p2 is in location l2_1". So p2 is at l2_1, needs to go to l2_2. But there are a lot of constraints that have to be met during the plan.

But wait, the constraints are complicated. Let's list all the constraints:

1. "Package p2 is in location l2_2" must be true in at least one state.
   Well, that's the goal, so that's covered.

2. If p2 is in l2_2 in some state, there must be an earlier state where p2 is in l2_3 or l1_5. But initially, p2 is in l2_1, so we need to move it to l2_3 or l1_5 at some point before it gets to l2_2.

3. p2 must be in l1_5 in some state.

4. Both p2 in l1_3 and p1 in l1_5 must hold in some state. But p1 is already in l2_3. So we have to move p1 to l1_5 and p2 to l1_3 at some point.

5. At least one of p1 in t1 or p1 in l2_2 must hold in some state. Since t1 is a truck in l1_4, perhaps moving p1 into t1 would require getting it there.

6. p2 must be in l2_1 in some state. Initially, it's there, so that's covered, but maybe during the plan it's moved away and back. Wait, the initial state has p2 in l2_1. So the constraint is already satisfied unless we move it out. Wait, but the plan might involve moving p2 from l2_1 to somewhere else and then back. But the constraint just requires that in at least one state (could be the initial) p2 is in l2_1. So that's already satisfied. So maybe we don't need to do anything for that constraint.

7. If p2 is in l2_1 in some state s, then p1 must be in l1_4 in s or after. Initially, p1 is in l2_3, which is not l1_4. So if during the plan, p2 is moved back to l2_1 (from somewhere else), then we need to ensure p1 is in l1_4 at that time or after. But since the initial state has p2 in l2_1, and the goal requires p2 to be in l2_2, maybe the initial state counts. So in the initial state, p2 is in l2_1, so we need p1 to be in l1_4 either in the initial state (it's not) or after. So we have to move p1 to l1_4 at some point after the initial state, but before p2 is moved away from l2_1, or ensure that once p2 is in l2_1 again, p1 is in l1_4. But maybe p2 starts in l2_1, so the constraint applies to that initial state. Since in the initial state, p1 is not in l1_4, we need to have p1 in l1_4 at some state after the initial. But how does that work? The constraint says if p2 is in l2_1 in state s, then p1 must be in l1_4 in s or after. So since the initial state is s0 where p2 is in l2_1, we must have p1 in l1_4 at s0 or after. But p1 is not in l1_4 in s0, so we must have p1 in l1_4 at some point after s0. So in the plan, we need to move p1 to l1_4 at some point.

8. p1 must be in l2_5 in some state.

9. p1 must be in a2 in some state.

10. p1 must be in t2 in some state.

11. Either p2 is in a1 or in l1_2 at some state.

12. Either p2 is in l1_4 or p1 is in a2 at some state.

So, putting all these constraints together, the plan must include steps that satisfy each of these. Let's start by considering the goal: p2 needs to go from l2_1 to l2_2. Since l2_1 is an airport in city c2, and l2_2 is a regular location in c2. Trucks can move within the city. Let's check the trucks available. There's t2 in location l2_2 (original state says "Package t2 is in location l2_2" â€” wait, no. Wait, the original state lists "Package t1 is in location l1_4", "Package t2 is in location l2_2". Wait, but t1 and t2 are trucks. So t1 is a truck in l1_4 (city c1), and t2 is a truck in l2_2 (city c2). So in city c2, the truck t2 is in l2_2. So to move p2 from l2_1 (airport) to l2_2, which is a regular location in c2. So we can use truck t2. But initially, p2 is in l2_1. So we need to load p2 into a truck or airplane. But l2_1 is an airport. Let's see. Wait, airplanes can be at airports. The original state says "Package a2 is in location l2_1". Wait, a2 is an airplane, so it's at l2_1. So maybe we can load p2 into a2 and fly it somewhere else. But the goal is to get p2 to l2_2, which is in the same city as l2_1. So perhaps the simplest way is to use the truck t2 in l2_2. Wait, but p2 is in l2_1. So how to get p2 to l2_2. Since t2 is in l2_2, maybe we need to drive t2 to l2_1? But wait, can a truck move between locations in the same city. The drivetruck action requires that both locations are in the same city. l2_1 is in c2, and l2_2 is also in c2. So truck t2 can be driven from l2_2 to l2_1. Then, load p2 into t2 at l2_1, drive back to l2_2, and unload. But wait, t2 is initially at l2_2. So first, drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1. Then load p2 into t2, then drive back to l2_2, unload. That would achieve the goal. But we have to check all the constraints.

But let's think about the constraints. Let's list each constraint and see how to satisfy them.

Constraint 3: p2 in l1_5. So we need to move p2 to l1_5 at some point. l1_5 is in city c1. So how? To get p2 from c2 to c1, we need to use an airplane. The airplanes a1 is in l1_1 (airport), a2 is in l2_1 (airport). So we can load p2 into a2 at l2_1, fly a2 to l1_1, unload p2 there. Then use truck t1 (in l1_4) to move p2 to l1_5. But that would require moving p2 from l2_1 to l1_1 via a2, then to l1_5 via t1. Then, perhaps move it back to c2 again. But that's a longer process, but necessary to satisfy the constraint that p2 is in l1_5.

But the goal is to have p2 in l2_2. So maybe the plan would involve moving p2 from l2_1 to l1_5, then back to l2_2. But how?

Alternatively, maybe moving p2 to l1_5 via a2 and t1, then back to c2 via another airplane, but then we'd need another airplane. But there's a1 in c1's airport. So perhaps:

1. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1 (but can a2 fly from c2 to c1? Yes, because flyairplane can go from any airport to another. So a2 can fly from l2_1 (c2's airport) to l1_1 (c1's airport). Then unload p2 there. Then use truck t1 (in l1_4) to drive to l1_1, load p2 into t1, drive to l1_5, unload. That would satisfy constraint 3 (p2 in l1_5). Then, to get p2 back to c2, maybe load it onto a1 (which is in l1_1), fly a1 to l2_1, unload, then use truck t2 to move to l2_2. But this would involve a lot of steps.

But we also need to satisfy other constraints. Let's see:

Constraint 4: p2 in l1_3 and p1 in l1_5. So we need to have p2 in l1_3 and p1 in l1_5 in the same state. Since p1 starts in l2_3 (city c2), we need to move p1 to c1. How? Using airplanes. For example, load p1 into a2 (which is in l2_1), fly a2 to l1_1, unload p1, then use truck t1 to drive to l1_1, load p1, drive to l1_5, unload. But that would get p1 to l1_5. Then, for p2 to be in l1_3, perhaps after moving p2 to l1_5 via t1, we can drive t1 to l1_3 and unload p2 there. But then, we need to have both p2 in l1_3 and p1 in l1_5 at the same time. So after moving p1 to l1_5 and p2 to l1_3, that's the state where constraint 4 is satisfied.

But this is getting complicated. Let's try to outline a possible plan step by step, making sure all constraints are met.

First, let's handle constraint 7: If p2 is in l2_1 (which it is initially), then p1 must be in l1_4 at that state or after. Since in the initial state, p2 is in l2_1, but p1 is in l2_3, we need to move p1 to l1_4 at some point. So how? p1 is in l2_3 (city c2). To get to l1_4 (city c1), need to use an airplane. So load p1 into a2 at l2_1 (but a2 is in l2_1, and p1 is in l2_3. So need to get p1 to l2_1 first. How? Use truck t2, which is in l2_2. Drive t2 to l2_3, load p1, drive to l2_1, unload. Then load p1 into a2, fly to l1_1, unload, then use truck t1 (in l1_4) to drive to l1_1, load p1, drive to l1_4, unload. That would get p1 to l1_4. But this seems like a lot of steps.

Alternatively, perhaps after moving p1 into t2, then to l2_1, then load into a2, fly to l1_1, then use t1 to move to l1_4. So steps would be:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2 (drive t2 to l2_3)
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
3. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2 (drive to l2_1)
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (now p1 is in l2_1)
5. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (load into a2)
6. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (fly to c1's airport)
7. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1 (p1 is in l1_1)
8. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 (t1 moves to l1_1)
9. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
10. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1 (back to l1_4)
11. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4 (now p1 is in l1_4, satisfying constraint 7)

But this is a long sequence. Also, during this, p2 is still in l2_1. So after step 4, p1 is in l2_1. Then loaded into a2 and flown to c1. Then moved to l1_4. So after step 11, p1 is in l1_4. So the constraint 7 is satisfied because in the initial state, p2 is in l2_1, and after that, p1 is moved to l1_4. So that's okay.

But this is just part of the plan. Let's think about other constraints.

Constraint 5: p1 in t1 or l2_2. If p1 is loaded into t1 (step 9), then in step 9, p1 is in t1, which satisfies the condition. So that's covered.

Constraint 8: p1 in l2_5. l2_5 is in c2. So after moving p1 to l1_4, we need to get it back to l2_5. But why? Because the goal is p1 in l2_3, but the initial state already has p1 in l2_3. Wait, the original state says "Package p1 is in location l2_3". Wait, the goal is to have "Package p1 is in location l2_3" and "Package p2 is in location l2_2". So p1 is already in the goal location. So any movement of p1 would take it away and then need to bring it back. But the constraints require p1 to be in various places. So we need to move p1 around even though it's already at the goal. That complicates things.

Wait, the initial state has p1 in l2_3. The goal requires p1 to be in l2_3. So if we move p1 away and then bring it back, that's allowed. But the constraints require p1 to be in l2_5, which is in c2. So we have to move p1 from l2_3 to l2_5. How? Using truck t2. t2 is in l2_2. So drive t2 to l2_3, load p1, drive to l2_5, unload. But this would require p1 to be moved. But since the goal requires p1 to be in l2_3, we need to move it back. So after moving to l2_5, we need to bring it back. But this adds steps. Let's see:

For constraint 8, p1 must be in l2_5 in some state. So after step 11, p1 is in l1_4. To get to l2_5, we need to fly it back to c2. So:

12. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4 (assuming p1 is there)
13. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 (drive to airport)
14. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (now p1 is in l1_1)
15. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (a1 is in l1_1)
16. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (fly to c2's airport)
17. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 (p1 in l2_1)
18. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 (drive t2 to l2_1)
19. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
20. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
21. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (now p1 is in l2_5, satisfying constraint 8)
22. Then, to get p1 back to l2_3:
23. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_3 c2
24. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
25. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_3 (no, need to move to l2_3? Wait, p1 is already in l2_3. Wait, in step 24, we load p1 from l2_5 into t2 at l2_5, then drive to l2_3 and unload. Wait, no. If p1 is in t2 at l2_5, then drive t2 to l2_3, then unload. So:

23. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_3 c2
24. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (now p1 is back in l2_3, meeting the goal)

But this is a lot of steps. Let's check if all constraints are being met.

Constraint 9: p1 in a2. That's covered in step 5 (loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1).

Constraint 10: p1 in t2. In step 19, p1 is loaded into t2, so that's covered.

Constraint 11: p2 in a1 or l1_2. So we need to have p2 in a1 or l1_2. Suppose during the process of moving p2 to l1_5, we have to move it via a1. For example, after moving p2 to l1_1 via a2, then load into a1 and fly somewhere. But maybe not. Alternatively, after getting p2 to l1_5, we could move it to l1_2 using truck t1. So:

After moving p2 to l1_5 (via a2 and t1), drive t1 to l1_5, load p2, drive to l1_2, unload. That would satisfy p2 in l1_2, fulfilling constraint 11. Alternatively, load p2 into a1 at l1_1 and fly to another airport. But let's see.

But let's think about how p2 is moved. Let's outline steps for p2:

Original location: l2_1 (airport in c2). Need to get to l2_2 (city c2). But constraints require p2 to be in l1_5, l1_3, etc.

Possible steps for p2:

- Load p2 into a2 at l2_1 (since a2 is there).
- Fly a2 to l1_1 (c1's airport).
- Unload p2 into l1_1.
- Use truck t1 (in l1_4) to drive to l1_1, load p2, drive to l1_5, unload (satisfy constraint 3).
- Then drive t1 to l1_3, load p2, unload (so p2 is in l1_3, and if p1 is in l1_5 at the same time, constraint 4 is met. But when would p1 be in l1_5? Earlier steps involved moving p1 to l1_4, but perhaps in another part of the plan, p1 is moved to l1_5.

Wait, this is getting very tangled. Let's try to create a comprehensive plan that covers all constraints step by step.

Let's list all the constraints again and check off each one as we address them:

Constraints:
1. p2 in l2_2 (goal)
2. If p2 is in l2_2, there must be an earlier state where p2 is in l2_3 or l1_5.
3. p2 in l1_5
4. p2 in l1_3 and p1 in l1_5 (same state)
5. p1 in t1 or l2_2
6. p2 in l2_1 (initial state, already satisfied)
7. If p2 in l2_1 (initial), then p1 in l1_4 after
8. p1 in l2_5
9. p1 in a2
10. p1 in t2
11. p2 in a1 or l1_2
12. p2 in l1_4 or p1 in a2

Let's tackle them one by one.

First, constraint 7: Move p1 to l1_4. As earlier steps.

Constraint 9: p1 in a2. So load p1 into a2 at l2_1.

Constraint 10: p1 in t2. So load p1 into t2 at some point.

Constraint 8: p1 in l2_5. So need to move p1 there.

Constraint 5: p1 in t1 or l2_2. If p1 is in t1 during the steps of moving to l1_4, that's covered.

Constraint 12: Either p2 in l1_4 or p1 in a2. Since p1 is in a2 (step 5), that's covered.

Constraint 11: p2 in a1 or l1_2. Let's plan to move p2 to l1_2 via truck t1.

Constraint 3: p2 in l1_5.

Constraint 4: p2 in l1_3 and p1 in l1_5. So need to have both in those locations at the same state.

Let's try to structure the plan.

Phase 1: Move p1 to l1_4 to satisfy constraint 7.

Steps:

1. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_3 (c2) to pick up p1.
   - drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
2. Load p1 into t2 at l2_3.
   - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
3. Drive t2 to l2_1 (airport).
   - drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
4. Unload p1 at l2_1.
   - unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
5. Load p1 into a2 at l2_1.
   - loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (satisfies constraint 9)
6. Fly a2 to l1_1 (c1's airport).
   - flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
7. Unload p1 from a2 at l1_1.
   - unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
8. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1.
   - drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
9. Load p1 into t1 at l1_1.
   - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (satisfies constraint 5: p1 in t1)
10. Drive t1 to l1_4.
    - drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1
11. Unload p1 at l1_4.
    - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4 (satisfies constraint 7)

Now, p1 is in l1_4. 

Phase 2: Move p1 to l2_5 (constraint 8) and satisfy other constraints.

12. Load p1 into t1 at l1_4.
    - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
13. Drive t1 to l1_1.
    - drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
14. Unload p1 at l1_1.
    - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
15. Load p1 into a1 (which is at l1_1).
    - loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
16. Fly a1 to l2_1 (c2's airport).
    - flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
17. Unload p1 at l2_1.
    - unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
18. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_5 (since t2 is in l2_1 after step 3, but wait, after step 3, t2 was driven to l2_1. Wait, no. Step 3 was driving t2 to l2_1, but after step 4, t2 is still in l2_1. Then steps 5-17 involve a2 and t1. So t2 is still in l2_1 after step 4. So after step 17, p1 is in l2_1. Now, drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_5:

    drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
19. Load p1 into t2 at l2_5.
    - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (satisfies constraint 10: p1 in t2)
20. Drive t2 to l2_5? Wait, no. t2 is already at l2_5. Wait, step 18 was drive to l2_5. Then, load p1 into t2 at l2_5. Then drive back to l2_3 to unload p1.

Wait, no. After step 18, t2 is at l2_5. p1 is at l2_1. So how to get p1 into t2? Maybe I messed up the steps.

Wait, after step 17, p1 is unloaded at l2_1. So to load into t2, which is at l2_1? No, after step 4, t2 was at l2_1, but after step 18, t2 is driven to l2_5. So steps 18 would be:

18. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2 (moving t2 from l2_1 to l2_5)
But p1 is in l2_1. So we need to load p1 into t2 at l2_1 before driving to l2_5. Wait, this is conflicting. Let me re-examine.

After step 17, p1 is in l2_1. To get p1 into t2, t2 needs to be in l2_1. But after step 4, t2 is in l2_1. But after step 18, which is driving t2 to l2_5, t2 is no longer there. So perhaps after step 17, we need to load p1 into t2 while t2 is still in l2_1. But after step 4, t2 was driven to l2_1 and left there. So in step 17, p1 is in l2_1. So steps 18-20 should be:

18. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (constraint 10: p1 in t2)
19. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
20. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (constraint 8 satisfied)
21. Then drive t2 back to l2_3 to unload p1:

21. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_3 c2
22. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (back to goal)

But this skips some steps. Let's correct the sequence:

After step 17, p1 is in l2_1. t2 is in l2_1 (from step 3). So:

18. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (p1 in t2, satisfies constraint 10)
19. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_5 c2
20. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (constraint 8 met)
21. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_3 c2
22. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (goal met)

Now, p1 is back in l2_3. But this part of the plan is for constraints 8,10.

Phase 3: Moving p2 to meet constraints.

p2 starts at l2_1. Need to get to l2_2 (goal), but also pass through l1_5, l1_3, etc.

First, move p2 from l2_1 to l1_1 via a2:

23. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (a2 is at l2_1)
24. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
25. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (p2 in l1_1, c1's airport)

Now, move p2 to l1_5 using t1:

26. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1 (t1 is at l1_4 from step 10)
27. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
28. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
29. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 (constraint 3 met)

Now, p2 is in l1_5. To meet constraint 4 (p2 in l1_3 and p1 in l1_5), we need to get p2 to l1_3 and p1 to l1_5. But p1 is currently in l2_3. To get p1 to l1_5, we need to move it again. Wait, but this is getting too complicated. Maybe we can adjust the plan to have p1 in l1_5 at some point.

Alternatively, perhaps during the earlier steps, when p1 was moved to l1_4, we can also move it to l1_5. For example, after step 11, p1 is in l1_4. Then:

12. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1
13. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
14. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 (now p1 is in l1_5)

But why? Because this would allow us to have p1 in l1_5 when p2 is moved to l1_3. But we need both in the same state. So perhaps after moving p2 to l1_3, we can have p1 in l1_5.

But this requires more steps. Let's try:

After step 29 (p2 in l1_5), drive t1 to l1_3:

30. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1
31. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
32. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (now p2 in l1_3)

But at this point, p1 is in l2_3 (from step 22). To have p1 in l1_5, we need to move it again. This is getting too long. Maybe another approach.

Alternative idea: Use a different sequence where p1 is moved to l1_5 and p2 to l1_3 in the same state.

But given time constraints, perhaps the optimal plan is to find the shortest path that satisfies all constraints. Let's try to identify the minimal steps required.

Alternative approach:

Given the goal is p1 in l2_3 (already there) and p2 in l2_2.

Constraints require p2 to be in l2_2 (goal), l1_5, l1_3, l2_1 (initial), l2_3 or l1_5 before l2_2, and others.

But since p1 is already at the goal, but the constraints require moving it around, perhaps the minimal plan involves moving p1 and p2 in a way that covers all constraints with the fewest steps.

For example:

1. Load p2 into a2 at l2_1 (constraint 12: p1 in a2 is already met later when p1 is loaded into a2)

But let's think step-by-step again.

Here's a possible optimal plan outline:

1. Load p2 into a2 at l2_1.
2. Fly a2 to l1_1.
3. Unload p2 into l1_1.
4. Load p2 into t1 (drive t1 to l1_1).
5. Drive t1 to l1_5 (p2 in l1_5, constraint 3).
6. Drive t1 to l1_3, unload p2 (p2 in l1_3).
7. Load p1 into t1 (drive t1 to l1_4, then to l1_5 to load p1? Not sure.

Alternatively, after step 5 (p2 in l1_5), drive t1 to l1_3 and unload p2 (constraint 4 needs p2 in l1_3 and p1 in l1_5. So need to have p1 in l1_5 when p2 is in l1_3.

So steps:

To get p1 to l1_5:

- From initial, p1 is in l2_3. Load into t2, drive to l2_1, load into a2, fly to l1_1, unload, load into t1, drive to l1_5.

This would require:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
3. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
5. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (constraint 9 met)
6. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
7. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
8. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
9. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
10. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
11. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 (now p1 is in l1_5)

Now, moving p2:

12. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (a2 was at l1_1 after step 6. Wait, no. After step 6, a2 is at l1_1. So to load p2 into a2, we need a2 to be at l2_1. But after step 6, a2 is at l1_1. So we need to fly a2 back to l2_1.

But this complicates things. Alternative approach:

Perhaps use a different airplane for p2. For example, use a1 (in l1_1) to transport p2.

But initial state: a1 is in l1_1, a2 in l2_1.

So:

For p2:

1. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
2. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
3. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
4. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
5. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
6. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
7. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 (constraint 3)
8. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1
9. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (p2 in l1_3)

Now, to have p1 in l1_5 at the same time as p2 in l1_3, we need p1 to be in l1_5 when p2 is in l1_3. So during steps 1-9, p1 is moved to l1_5 (steps 1-11 earlier), then after that, p2 is moved to l1_3. So at step 9, p2 is in l1_3, and p1 is in l1_5 (from step 11). So that state satisfies constraint 4.

Then, to move p2 back to c2:

10. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
11. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
12. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
13. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (a1 is here)
14. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
15. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (p2 back in l2_1)
16. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2 (t2 is in l2_2 initially)
17. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
18. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
19. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (goal met)

But this leaves p1 in l1_5. We need to get p1 back to l2_3. So after step 11 (p1 in l1_5), perhaps:

12. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
13. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1
14. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
15. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
16. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
17. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
18. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
19. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
20. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
21. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

But this adds many steps. 

This is getting extremely complex. I think the optimal plan would require careful sequencing to cover all constraints with minimal steps. However, given the time I have, I'll try to compose a plan that covers all constraints step by step, even if it's not the shortest possible.

Final attempt:

Actions:

1. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (a2 is here)
2. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
3. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1 (p2 in l1_1, constraint 12: p1 not in a2 yet, but later steps)
4. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
5. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
6. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
7. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 (constraint 3)
8. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1
9. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (p2 in l1_3)

Now, to get p1 to l1_5:

10. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_5 c1
11. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 (p1 was moved earlier? Wait, no. p1 is initially in l2_3. So need to move p1 to l1_5.

Let me correct:

To move p1 to l1_5, steps:

10. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2 (t2 starts at l2_2)
11. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (constraint 10: p1 in t2)
12. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2
13. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
14. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (a2 is at l1_1 now, so need to fly back)
    Wait, a2 is at l1_1 from step 2. So need to fly a2 back to l2_1.

15. flyairplane a2 l1_1 l2_1
16. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (constraint 9)
17. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
18. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1
19. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1 (t1 is at l1_3 from step 9)
    No, t1 was at l1_3 after step 9. Need to drive to l1_1.

19. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
20. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
21. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_5 c1
22. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 (now p1 in l1_5, p2 in l1_3 from step 9. So in the state after step 22, both are in their positions, satisfying constraint 4)

Now, to move p2 back to c2:

23. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (p2 is in l1_3 from step 9)
24. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
25. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
26. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (a1 is at l1_1)
27. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
28. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (p2 back in l2_1)
29. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2 (t2 is at l2_1 from step 13)
30. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (p2 is in l2_1, drive to l2_2, but need to load at l2_1)
    Wait, after step 28, p2 is in l2_1. So:

29. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2 (drive empty t2 to l2_2)
30. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (but t2 is in l2_2 now. Can't load. Mistake here. So need to adjust.

Instead:

After step 28, p2 is in l2_1. So drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2, but how? Because t2 was driven to l2_1 in step 12 and left there. So after step 28:

29. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
30. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (can't, t2 is now in l2_2. So need to load before moving.

Correction:

After step 28, p2 is in l2_1. t2 is in l2_1 (from step 13). So:

29. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
30. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
31. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (goal met)

This way, p2 is loaded into t2 at l2_1, driven to l2_2, and unloaded.

Now, let's check the constraints:

- Constraint 2: p2 in l2_2 requires an earlier state where p2 is in l2_3 or l1_5. We have p2 in l1_5 (step 7), so satisfied.

- Constraint 3: p2 in l1_5 (step 7).

- Constraint 4: p2 in l1_3 and p1 in l1_5 (after step 22).

- Constraint 5: p1 in t2 (step 11).

- Constraint 7: After initial state, p2 in l2_1, so p1 must be in l1_4. When? After step 22, p1 is in l1_5. But we need to have p1 in l1_4 at some point. This hasn't been addressed yet. Oops.

To satisfy constraint 7, we need to move p1 to l1_4 after the initial state. Let's insert steps after step 22:

23. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1
24. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4 (p1 in l1_4)

Then proceed with moving p2 back.

Adjusting the steps:

After step 22 (p1 in l1_5):

23. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1
24. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4 (constraint 7 met)

Then continue moving p2:

25. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (but t1 is now at l1_4. So need to drive back to l1_3. This is getting too complicated. Perhaps another approach is needed.

Alternatively, after step 22, drive t1 to l1_4:

23. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1
24. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_4 (p1 now in l1_4)

Then, proceed to move p2.

This way, constraint 7 is satisfied.

Continuing:

25. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (but t1 is in l1_4. Need to drive to l1_3.

25. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1
26. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (p2 is in l1_3)
27. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_1 c1
28. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
29. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
30. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
31. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
32. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
33. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
34. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (goal met)

Now, let's check all constraints:

1. p2 in l2_2: step 34.

2. Earlier state p2 in l1_5 (step7).

3. p2 in l1_5: step7.

4. p2 in l1_3 and p1 in l1_5: after step 22, p1 in l1_5 and p2 in l1_3 (step9).

5. p1 in t2: step11.

6. p2 in l2_1: step31.

7. After initial state (p2 in l2_1), p1 in l1_4: step24.

8. p1 in l2_5: not addressed yet. Oops. So need to add steps to move p1 to l2_5.

This is getting extremely long. Given the time constraints, perhaps the optimal plan isn't required to be the absolute shortest, but must satisfy all constraints. However, I'm likely missing steps here. 

Given the complexity, perhaps the correct answer involves a series of actions that move p2 through various locations to meet the constraints, while moving p1 as needed. But given the time I've spent and the risk of errors, I'll attempt to write a concise plan that covers all constraints, even if it's not the shortest possible.
