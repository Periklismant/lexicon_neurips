Let me analyze the problem:

Given:
- We have two cities: c1 and c2
- Each city has several locations, including an airport
  - City c1: locations l1_1 (airport), l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5
  - City c2: locations l2_1 (airport), l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5
- We have two packages: p1 and p2
- We have two trucks: t1 and t2
- We have two airplanes: a1 and a2

Initial State:
- "Package t1 is in location l1_4" (I think this should be "Truck t1 is in location l1_4")
- "Package t2 is in location l2_2" (I think this should be "Truck t2 is in location l2_2")
- "Package p1 is in location l2_3"
- "Package p2 is in location l2_1"
- "Package a1 is in location l1_1" (I think this should be "Airplane a1 is in location l1_1")
- "Package a2 is in location l2_1" (I think this should be "Airplane a2 is in location l2_1")

Goal:
- "Package p1 is in location l2_3"
- "Package p2 is in location l2_2"

I notice some mistakes in the initial state descriptions. The objects t1, t2, a1, and a2 are labeled as packages when they should be trucks and airplanes. Let me correct these:

Corrected Initial State:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_4
- Truck t2 is in location l2_2
- Package p1 is in location l2_3
- Package p2 is in location l2_1
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

Now, looking at the goal state:
- Package p1 is already in location l2_3, so we don't need to move it.
- Package p2 needs to be moved from location l2_1 to location l2_2.

To move p2 from l2_1 to l2_2, we can:
1. Load p2 into truck t2 (since t2 is already in l2_2, we need to drive it to l2_1 first)
2. Drive truck t2 from l2_2 to l2_1
3. Load p2 into truck t2
4. Drive truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_2
5. Unload p2 from truck t2

Let's formalize this plan:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
3. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

Wait, I notice a mistake in my approach. I didn't correctly check the current state of p1. Let me verify both packages:

- Package p1 is in location l2_3 (which is the goal location for p1)
- Package p2 is in location l2_1 (needs to be moved to l2_2)

So, p1 is already at its goal location, and p2 needs to be moved from l2_1 to l2_2.

Now, let's create the optimal plan:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
3. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

This plan should achieve the goal state.

Actually, wait. I think I'm still not understanding the initial state correctly. Let me double-check:

- "Package t1 is in location l1_4" (This should probably be "Truck t1 is in location l1_4")
- "Package t2 is in location l2_2" (This should probably be "Truck t2 is in location l2_2")
- "Package p1 is in location l2_3" (Correct)
- "Package p2 is in location l2_1" (Correct)
- "Package a1 is in location l1_1" (This should probably be "Airplane a1 is in location l1_1")
- "Package a2 is in location l2_1" (This should probably be "Airplane a2 is in location l2_1")

I'm going to assume these are typos in the problem statement, and the actual initial state is:

- Truck t1 is in location l1_4
- Truck t2 is in location l2_2
- Package p1 is in location l2_3
- Package p2 is in location l2_1
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

Given this interpretation, my plan is:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
3. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

Actually, let me make sure I'm understanding the goal correctly:

Goal: "The following conditions are all true: 'Package p1 is in location l2_3', 'Package p2 is in location l2_2'"

So we want:
- Package p1 to be in location l2_3
- Package p2 to be in location l2_2

Checking our (interpreted) initial state:
- Package p1 is in location l2_3 (already meets the goal)
- Package p2 is in location l2_1 (needs to be moved to l2_2)

So we only need to move package p2 from l2_1 to l2_2. We can use truck t2 which is in l2_2.

My plan:
1. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
3. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

Wait, I'm now questioning my interpretation. Let's re-read the initial state and be more careful.

"Package t1 is in location l1_4" - This is confusing because t1 is defined as a truck, not a package.
"Package t2 is in location l2_2" - Similarly, t2 is a truck, not a package.
"Package p1 is in location l2_3" - This is consistent.
"Package p2 is in location l2_1" - This is consistent.
"Package a1 is in location l1_1" - a1 is defined as an airplane, not a package.
"Package a2 is in location l2_1" - a2 is defined as an airplane, not a package.

The issue is that the initial state uses "Package" to refer to trucks and airplanes. This is very confusing, and I think it's a mistake in the problem statement. Let's assume the correct interpretation is:

- Truck t1 is in location l1_4
- Truck t2 is in location l2_2
- Package p1 is in location l2_3
- Package p2 is in location l2_1
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

With this interpretation, my plan is still the same:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
3. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

This should achieve the goal state.

Actually, I'm noticing yet another inconsistency. The problem says "loadairplane p ap l" twice, once for loading and once for unloading. The second one should likely be "unloadairplane p ap l".

Let me revise the action descriptions:

Available actions:
- "loadtruck p t l": Load package p in truck t. Both p and t are in location l.
- "loadairplane p ap l": Load package p in airplane ap. Both p and ap are in location l.
- "unloadtruck p t l": Unload package p from truck t in location l.
- "unloadairplane p ap l": Unload package p from airplane ap in location l. (corrected from "loadairplane")
- "drivetruck t l_from l_to c": Drive truck t from location l_from to location l_to in city c.
- "flyairplane ap l_from l_to": Fly airplane ap from location l_from to location l_to.

Now, my plan remains the same as before:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
3. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

This should achieve the goal state.

Actually, I just realized I'm misreading the initial state. Let me re-read it more carefully:

"Package t1 is in location l1_4" - I think what this means is that the package named "t1" is in location l1_4. But this is confusing because t1 is defined as a truck. I think there's a typo in the problem, and it should say "Truck t1 is in location l1_4".

Similarly, the other statements with "Package" followed by a truck or airplane name probably have typos. Let me reconsider the initial state:

- Truck t1 is in location l1_4
- Truck t2 is in location l2_2
- Package p1 is in location l2_3
- Package p2 is in location l2_1
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

Given this interpretation, my plan is:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
3. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

Let me triple-check my understanding of the initial state and goals:

Initial State (corrected interpretation):
- Truck t1 is in location l1_4
- Truck t2 is in location l2_2
- Package p1 is in location l2_3
- Package p2 is in location l2_1
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

Goal:
- Package p1 is in location l2_3 (already satisfied)
- Package p2 is in location l2_2 (needs to be moved from l2_1)

So, my plan is:
1. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
3. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

Let me verify that this plan works:

Initial State:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_4
- Truck t2 is in location l2_2
- Package p1 is in location l2_3
- Package p2 is in location l2_1
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

1. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
   - Precondition: t2 is in l2_2, and l2_2 and l2_1 are locations in city c2. (Satisfied)
   - Effect: t2 is no longer in l2_2, and t2 is in l2_1.

After Step 1:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_4
- Truck t2 is in location l2_1
- Package p1 is in location l2_3
- Package p2 is in location l2_1
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
   - Precondition: p2 and t2 are in l2_1. (Satisfied)
   - Effect: p2 is no longer in l2_1, and p2 is in t2.

After Step 2:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_4
- Truck t2 is in location l2_1
- Package p1 is in location l2_3
- Package p2 is in truck t2
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

3. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
   - Precondition: t2 is in l2_1, and l2_1 and l2_2 are locations in city c2. (Satisfied)
   - Effect: t2 is no longer in l2_1, and t2 is in l2_2.

After Step 3:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_4
- Truck t2 is in location l2_2
- Package p1 is in location l2_3
- Package p2 is in truck t2
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
   - Precondition: t2 is in l2_2, and p2 is in t2. (Satisfied)
   - Effect: p2 is no longer in t2, and p2 is in l2_2.

After Step 4:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_4
- Truck t2 is in location l2_2
- Package p1 is in location l2_3
- Package p2 is in location l2_2
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

Goal Check:
- Package p1 is in location l2_3 (Satisfied)
- Package p2 is in location l2_2 (Satisfied)

Both goal conditions are satisfied after executing the plan, so the plan is valid.

Optimal Plan:
```
drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2
loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1
drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2
unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2
```
