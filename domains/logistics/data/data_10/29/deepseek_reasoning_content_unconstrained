Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. First, I need to understand the initial state, the goal, and the constraints. Let's start by listing out everything given.

The world has two cities, c1 and c2. Each city has several locations. The airports are l1_1 in c1 and l2_1 in c2. The packages, trucks, airplanes, and their initial locations are:

- Package t1 is in l1_4 (but wait, t1 is a truck, right? Wait, looking back, the objects list includes "truck t1" and "truck t2". So maybe there's a typo in the original state. The original state says "Package t1 is in location l1_4". That must be a mistake. Because t1 is a truck, not a package. Similarly, "Package t2 is in location l2_2" — t2 is a truck. Wait, that's confusing. Let me check again.

Wait the original state lists:

"Package t1 is in location l1_4"

"Package t2 is in location l2_2"

"Package p1 is in location l2_3"

"Package p2 is in location l2_1"

"Package a1 is in location l1_1"

"Package a2 is in location l2_1"

Wait, but a1 and a2 are airplanes. So there's a mistake here. The original state probably should state that trucks and airplanes are in certain locations, not as packages. For example, "Truck t1 is in location l1_4", "Airplane a1 is in location l1_1", etc. Otherwise, the initial state is incorrect because trucks and airplanes are not packages. But according to the problem description, the user provided the original state as written, so maybe it's a typo. So perhaps the correct initial state is:

- Truck t1 is in l1_4

- Truck t2 is in l2_2

- Package p1 is in l2_3

- Package p2 is in l2_1

- Airplane a1 is in l1_1

- Airplane a2 is in l2_1

Because otherwise, the problem doesn't make sense. Because the actions involve loading packages into trucks and airplanes. So the user probably made a mistake in the original state's descriptions. Let's proceed assuming that the initial state has the trucks and airplanes correctly placed, and the packages as stated. So the correct initial state would be:

Truck t1 is in l1_4 (city c1)

Truck t2 is in l2_2 (city c2)

Package p1 is in l2_3 (city c2)

Package p2 is in l2_1 (city c2, which is the airport of c2)

Airplane a1 is in l1_1 (airport of c1)

Airplane a2 is in l2_1 (airport of c2)

Wait, but according to the original state as written:

"Package t1 is in location l1_4" — so t1 is a package? But t1 is listed under trucks. That's conflicting. This must be an error in the problem statement. The user probably meant:

"Truck t1 is in location l1_4"

"Truck t2 is in location l2_2"

"Airplane a1 is in location l1_1"

"Airplane a2 is in location l2_1"

But the original state says "Package t1..." which is incorrect. So this is a problem. Without knowing where the trucks and airplanes are, the problem can't be solved. Assuming that the user made a typo, perhaps in the original state, the lines should be:

"Truck t1 is in location l1_4"

"Truck t2 is in location l2_2"

"Airplane a1 is in location l1_1"

"Airplane a2 is in location l2_1"

And the packages p1 is in l2_3, p2 in l2_1.

The goal is to have p1 in l2_3 (which is already where it is) and p2 in l2_2. Wait, the goal says:

"The following conditions are all true: 'Package p1 is in location l2_3', 'Package p2 is in location l2_2'"

Wait, but in the initial state, p1 is already in l2_3. So the goal for p1 is already satisfied. The only thing needed is to get p2 to l2_2.

Wait, that's confusing. Let me check again:

Original state:

- Package p1 is in l2_3 (city c2, location l2_3)

- Package p2 is in l2_1 (city c2, airport l2_1)

Goal:

- p1 in l2_3 (already there)

- p2 in l2_2.

So the plan only needs to move p2 from l2_1 to l2_2.

But wait, l2_1 is an airport in c2. So how can p2 get to l2_2, which is another location in c2. Since in the same city, trucks can move between locations. So maybe use a truck in c2 to transport p2.

Looking at the trucks in c2: Truck t2 is in l2_2 (assuming the original state meant Truck t2 is in l2_2). So if t2 is in l2_2, but p2 is in l2_1. So to move p2 to l2_2, perhaps:

1. Drive truck t2 from l2_2 to l2_1? Wait, but l2_1 is an airport, which is in c2, so the truck can drive there. Wait, the cities have locations l2_1 to l2_5. The truck can move between any locations in the same city. So t2 is in l2_2. We need to get it to l2_1 to pick up p2, then drive back to l2_2, then unload.

Wait, but if the truck is in l2_2, to get to l2_1, drive to l2_1. Then load p2 into t2, then drive back to l2_2 and unload.

So the steps would be:

1. Drive truck t2 from l2_2 to l2_1 (city c2). That's allowed since both are in c2.

But wait, can a truck move from any location to any other in the same city? Yes, according to the action drivetruck, as long as both locations are in the same city.

So after driving to l2_1, the truck is there. Then load p2 into t2 (since both are in l2_1). Then drive back to l2_2, then unload p2 there.

So the plan would be:

drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2

loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2

unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

That's four actions. But wait, in the initial state, is truck t2 in l2_2? If yes, then this plan works.

But let's check the constraints. The problem says the plan must satisfy all constraints. The user didn't mention any additional constraints, except the ones inherent in the actions' preconditions and effects.

Wait, looking back: The user wrote "A valid plan for the abovementioned problem must abide by the following constraints:" but then there's nothing listed. Maybe that's a formatting error. But assuming no additional constraints beyond the usual.

So the plan would be as above. But let's verify again.

Original state of p2: in l2_1 (airport of c2). Truck t2 is in l2_2.

So steps:

1. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1. Now t2 is in l2_1.

2. Load p2 into t2 at l2_1. Since p2 is there and t2 is there.

3. Drive t2 back to l2_2.

4. Unload p2 in l2_2.

That's four steps, and it's optimal. No shorter plan possible because you need to move the truck to the package, load, move back, unload.

But wait, is there a shorter way? For example, if there's another truck in c2? The problem says there are trucks t1 and t2. t1 is in l1_4 (c1), so not in c2. So only t2 is in c2. So yes, the plan must use t2.

Therefore, the plan is as above.

But the problem states that the user wants the answer in a specific format. So the actions should be:

drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2

loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2

unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2

Each action on a separate line, enclosed between triple backticks.

But wait, the problem mentions that the goal requires both p1 and p2 to be in their respective locations. However, p1 is already in l2_3, so no actions are needed for it. So the plan only needs to handle p2.

So the four steps above should be the optimal plan.
