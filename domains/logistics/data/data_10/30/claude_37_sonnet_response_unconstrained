Let me analyze the problem:

1. We have cities c1 and c2.
2. Each city has multiple locations, including an airport. The airports are l1_1 (for city c1) and l2_1 (for city c2).
3. We have packages p1 and p2, both initially at location l1_4 in city c1.
4. We have trucks t1 and t2, initially at locations l1_2 (in city c1) and l2_1 (in city c2), respectively.
5. We have airplanes a1 and a2, initially at airports l1_1 (in city c1) and l2_1 (in city c2), respectively.
6. The goal is to transport p1 to location l2_3 (in city c2) and p2 to location l1_2 (in city c1).

Let's plan the steps:

For p1 (from l1_4 to l2_3):
1. We need to load p1 into a truck and drive it to the airport l1_1.
2. Then, load p1 onto an airplane and fly it to the airport l2_1 in city c2.
3. Next, load p1 into a truck and drive it to location l2_3.
4. Finally, unload p1 at l2_3.

For p2 (from l1_4 to l1_2):
1. We need to load p2 into a truck and drive it to location l1_2.
2. Then, unload p2 at l1_2.

Let's create the detailed plan:

But first, I notice that in the initial state, it says:
```
"Package t1 is in location l1_2"
"Package t2 is in location l2_1"
"Package p1 is in location l1_4"
"Package p2 is in location l1_4"
"Package a1 is in location l1_1"
"Package a2 is in location l2_1"
```

This seems inconsistent because t1, t2, a1, and a2 are not packages but truck and airplane objects. Let me assume that these are typos and the intended initial state is:
```
"Truck t1 is in location l1_2"
"Truck t2 is in location l2_1"
"Package p1 is in location l1_4"
"Package p2 is in location l1_4"
"Airplane a1 is in location l1_1"
"Airplane a2 is in location l2_1"
```

With this corrected initial state, let's create the plan:

For p1 (from l1_4 to l2_3):
1. Drive truck t1 from l1_2 to l1_4.
2. Load package p1 into truck t1 at l1_4.
3. Drive truck t1 from l1_4 to l1_1 (the airport).
4. Unload package p1 from truck t1 at l1_1.
5. Load package p1 into airplane a1 at l1_1.
6. Fly airplane a1 from l1_1 to l2_1 (the airport in city c2).
7. Unload package p1 from airplane a1 at l2_1.
8. Drive truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_3.
9. Load package p1 into truck t2 at l2_1.
10. Drive truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_3.
11. Unload package p1 from truck t2 at l2_3.

For p2 (from l1_4 to l1_2):
1. Drive truck t1 from l1_1 to l1_4.
2. Load package p2 into truck t1 at l1_4.
3. Drive truck t1 from l1_4 to l1_2.
4. Unload package p2 from truck t1 at l1_2.

Let me revise and provide the plan more concisely:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1  # Move truck t1 to where p1 and p2 are
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4        # Load p1 into truck t1
3. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4        # Load p2 into truck t1
4. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1  # Drive to the airport in city c1
5. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1      # Unload p1 at the airport
6. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1     # Load p1 into airplane a1
7. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1  # Drive truck t1 to l1_2
8. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2      # Unload p2 at l1_2 (goal achieved for p2)
9. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1    # Fly airplane a1 to the airport in city c2
10. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1   # Unload p1 at the airport in city c2
11. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1        # Load p1 into truck t2
12. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2  # Drive truck t2 to l2_3
13. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3      # Unload p1 at l2_3 (goal achieved for p1)

Hmm, actually I notice I made a big mistake in step 5-8, I didn't unload p1 from t1 to then load it onto the airplane. Let me revise the plan:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1  # Move truck t1 to where p1 and p2 are
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4        # Load p1 into truck t1
3. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4        # Load p2 into truck t1
4. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1  # Drive to the airport in city c1
5. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1      # Unload p1 at the airport
6. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1     # Load p1 into airplane a1
7. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1  # Drive truck t1 to l1_2
8. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2      # Unload p2 at l1_2 (goal achieved for p2)
9. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1    # Fly airplane a1 to the airport in city c2
10. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1   # Unload p1 at the airport in city c2
11. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1        # Load p1 into truck t2
12. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2  # Drive truck t2 to l2_3
13. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3      # Unload p1 at l2_3 (goal achieved for p1)

Wait, that's actually the same plan I had before. I misunderstood my own plan. The truck t1 first drives to l1_4, loads p1 and p2, then drives to l1_1 (the airport). At l1_1, it unloads p1, which is then loaded onto a1. The truck t1 then drives to l1_2 and unloads p2 (achieving the goal for p2). Meanwhile, the airplane a1 flies to l2_1, unloads p1, which is then loaded onto t2. Then t2 drives to l2_3 and unloads p1 (achieving the goal for p1).

Let's double-check if this plan achieves the goals:
1. Package p1 is in location l2_3 ✓ (after step 13)
2. Package p2 is in location l1_2 ✓ (after step 8)

So, this plan meets the goals. Let me just check if there are any optimizations we can make.

Well, as it stands, we took the most straightforward approach.
1. p1 is at l1_4, and we want it at l2_3. We used t1 to bring it to the airport l1_1, then airplane a1 to fly it to l2_1, and then t2 to drive it to l2_3.
2. p2 is at l1_4, and we want it at l1_2. We used t1 to drive it directly to l1_2.

I don't see any obvious optimizations, especially since the problem statement mentions that we need an optimal plan, i.e., a valid plan with minimum length.

But wait, let's actually check the action `loadairplane`, because I think I might have made a mistake. The precondition says:
```
"loadairplane": You may only load package p in a airplane ap if ap and t are in the same location l.
```

I see a typo here; it should be "if ap and p are in the same location l" (not "ap and t"). Assuming this correction, my plan still holds.

Just to be super-sure, let me verify each action in the plan:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1
   Preconditions: Truck t1 in l1_2; both l1_2 and l1_4 are in city c1. ✓
   Effects: Truck t1 is now in l1_4. ✓

2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
   Preconditions: Package p1 and truck t1 are both in location l1_4. ✓
   Effects: Package p1 is now in truck t1 and not in location l1_4. ✓

3. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
   Preconditions: Package p2 and truck t1 are both in location l1_4. ✓
   Effects: Package p2 is now in truck t1 and not in location l1_4. ✓

4. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_1 c1
   Preconditions: Truck t1 in l1_4; both l1_4 and l1_1 are in city c1. ✓
   Effects: Truck t1 is now in l1_1. ✓

5. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
   Preconditions: Truck t1 is in l1_1; package p1 is in truck t1. ✓
   Effects: Package p1 is now in location l1_1 and not in truck t1. ✓

6. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
   Preconditions: Package p1 and airplane a1 are both in location l1_1. ✓
   Effects: Package p1 is now in airplane a1 and not in location l1_1. ✓

7. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
   Preconditions: Truck t1 in l1_1; both l1_1 and l1_2 are in city c1. ✓
   Effects: Truck t1 is now in l1_2. ✓

8. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
   Preconditions: Truck t1 is in l1_2; package p2 is in truck t1. ✓
   Effects: Package p2 is now in location l1_2 and not in truck t1. ✓ (This achieves the goal for p2)

9. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
   Preconditions: Airplane a1 is in l1_1. ✓
   Effects: Airplane a1 is now in l2_1 and not in l1_1. ✓

10. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
    Preconditions: Airplane a1 is in l2_1; package p1 is in airplane a1. ✓
    Effects: Package p1 is now in location l2_1 and not in airplane a1. ✓

11. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
    Preconditions: Package p1 and truck t2 are both in location l2_1. ✓
    Effects: Package p1 is now in truck t2 and not in location l2_1. ✓

12. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
    Preconditions: Truck t2 in l2_1; both l2_1 and l2_3 are in city c2. ✓
    Effects: Truck t2 is now in l2_3. ✓

13. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
    Preconditions: Truck t2 is in l2_3; package p1 is in truck t2. ✓
    Effects: Package p1 is now in location l2_3 and not in truck t2. ✓ (This achieves the goal for p1)

The plan seems valid and achieves both goals. Let's check if there are any other optimizations we can make.

One thing to note is that steps 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 (related to p1) can be executed concurrently with steps 7 and 8 (related to p2), as they involve different resources (a1 and t2 for p1, t1 for p2). However, the problem asks for a sequential plan, so this is not applicable.

I believe the plan is optimal for the given state and goals.

Hmm, one second, I notice the following in the initial state:
```
"Package p1 is in location l1_4"
"Package p2 is in location l1_4"
"Airplane a1 is in location l1_1"
"Airplane a2 is in location l2_1"
```

Hmm, I also need to make sure that I'm understanding the problem correctly. Let me re-read the problem.

I'm still confused about the definition of the unloadtruck action above. Let me check the definition again.

```
"loadairplane p ap l": Load package p in airplane ap. Both p and ap are in location l.
"unloadtruck p t l": Unload package p from truck t in location l.
"loadairplane p ap l": Unload package p from airplane ap in location l.
```

There seems to be a typo here. The third action should probably be "unloadairplane" instead of "loadairplane" again. I'll proceed with that assumption.

Also, I notice another potential issue. When I provided the plan, I followed the format `"loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4"` for the actions. However, in the problem description, the format for this action is described as `"loadtruck p t l"`, where p, t, and l are variables. I'll make sure to use the correct format in the final plan.

Actually, let's just restart with the knowledge, and make sure to properly interpret the problem.

- We have cities c1 and c2.
- City c1 has locations l1_1 (the airport), l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, and l1_5.
- City c2 has locations l2_1 (the airport), l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, and l2_5.
- Package p1 is initially at location l1_4 (in city c1).
- Package p2 is initially at location l1_4 (in city c1).
- Truck t1 is initially at location l1_2 (in city c1).
- Truck t2 is initially at location l2_1 (in city c2).
- Airplane a1 is initially at location l1_1 (the airport in city c1).
- Airplane a2 is initially at location l2_1 (the airport in city c2).
- Our task is to move package p1 to location l2_3 (in city c2) and package p2 to location l1_2 (in city c1).

Let's come up with a plan:

For p1 (from l1_4 in city c1 to l2_3 in city c2):
1. Need to use a truck to transport p1 from l1_4 to l1_1 (the airport in city c1).
2. Need to use an airplane to transport p1 from l1_1 to l2_1 (the airport in city c2).
3. Need to use a truck to transport p1 from l2_1 to l2_3.

For p2 (from l1_4 to l1_2, both in city c1):
1. Need to use a truck to transport p2 from l1_4 to l1_2.

The most efficient way would be to use truck t1 for both packages, then use airplane a1 for p1, and finally use truck t2 for p1. Let's outline the plan:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1  # Move truck t1 to where p1 and p2 are
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4        # Load p1 into truck t1
3. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4        # Load p2 into truck t1
4. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1  # Drive truck t1 to l1_2
5. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2      # Unload p2 at l1_2 (goal achieved for p2)
6. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1  # Drive truck t1 to the airport in city c1
7. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1      # Unload p1 at the airport
8. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1     # Load p1 into airplane a1
9. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1    # Fly airplane a1 to the airport in city c2
10. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1   # Unload p1 at the airport in city c2
11. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1        # Load p1 into truck t2
12. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2  # Drive truck t2 to l2_3
13. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3      # Unload p1 at l2_3 (goal achieved for p1)

This plan is slightly different from my previous one and seems more efficient because we drop off p2 on the way to the airport, rather than going to the airport first and then backtracking to l1_2.

Let's verify this plan:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1
   Preconditions: Truck t1 in l1_2; both l1_2 and l1_4 are in city c1. ✓
   Effects: Truck t1 is now in l1_4. ✓

2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
   Preconditions: Package p1 and truck t1 are both in location l1_4. ✓
   Effects: Package p1 is now in truck t1 and not in location l1_4. ✓

3. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
   Preconditions: Package p2 and truck t1 are both in location l1_4. ✓
   Effects: Package p2 is now in truck t1 and not in location l1_4. ✓

4. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1
   Preconditions: Truck t1 in l1_4; both l1_4 and l1_2 are in city c1. ✓
   Effects: Truck t1 is now in l1_2. ✓

5. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
   Preconditions: Truck t1 is in l1_2; package p2 is in truck t1. ✓
   Effects: Package p2 is now in location l1_2 and not in truck t1. ✓ (This achieves the goal for p2)

6. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
   Preconditions: Truck t1 in l1_2; both l1_2 and l1_1 are in city c1. ✓
   Effects: Truck t1 is now in l1_1. ✓

7. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
   Preconditions: Truck t1 is in l1_1; package p1 is in truck t1. ✓
   Effects: Package p1 is now in location l1_1 and not in truck t1. ✓

8. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
   Preconditions: Package p1 and airplane a1 are both in location l1_1. ✓
   Effects: Package p1 is now in airplane a1 and not in location l1_1. ✓

9. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
   Preconditions: Airplane a1 is in l1_1. ✓
   Effects: Airplane a1 is now in l2_1 and not in l1_1. ✓

10. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
    Preconditions: Airplane a1 is in l2_1; package p1 is in airplane a1. ✓
    Effects: Package p1 is now in location l2_1 and not in airplane a1. ✓

11. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
    Preconditions: Package p1 and truck t2 are both in location l2_1. ✓
    Effects: Package p1 is now in truck t2 and not in location l2_1. ✓

12. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
    Preconditions: Truck t2 in l2_1; both l2_1 and l2_3 are in city c2. ✓
    Effects: Truck t2 is now in l2_3. ✓

13. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
    Preconditions: Truck t2 is in l2_3; package p1 is in truck t2. ✓
    Effects: Package p1 is now in location l2_3 and not in truck t2. ✓ (This achieves the goal for p1)

This plan is valid and achieves both goals. I believe it is the optimal (minimum length) plan for the given problem.

On second thought, let's see if there are any other optimizations...

I'm thinking about whether we can have the two tasks be processed in parallel by different trucks.

We could have t1 immediately go to l1_4, pickup p2, and deliver it to l1_2. At the same time (since we're in a logistics domain and can have simultaneous actions, though we're asked to provide a sequential plan), t2 could go to l1_4, pickup p1, take it to the airport l1_1, and then the airplane a1 would take it to l2_1, and from there, t2 would take it to l2_3.

Actually, t2 is already at a different city's airport, so it would need to wait for p1 to be transported by airplane. So the plan I provided is probably optimal. Let's double-check to be sure.

For p1, we need to:
1. Move it from l1_4 to the airport l1_1 (using a truck).
2. Fly it from l1_1 to l2_1 (using an airplane).
3. Move it from l2_1 to l2_3 (using a truck).

For p2, we need to:
1. Move it from l1_4 to l1_2 (using a truck).

Initially, we have t1 at l1_2 and t2 at l2_1.

If we use t1 for p2, we will have to:
1. Move t1 from l1_2 to l1_4.
2. Load p2 into t1.
3. Move t1 from l1_4 back to l1_2.
4. Unload p2.

And if we use t1 for p1, we will have to:
1. Move t1 from l1_2 to l1_4 (already done for p2).
2. Load p1 into t1.
3. Move t1 from l1_4 to l1_1.
4. Unload p1.

If we use t2 for p1, we will have to:
1. Move t2 from l2_1 to (somewhere, but we can't use t2 in city c1 without first flying it there, which isn't possible).

So, using t1 for both p1 and p2 seems like the best approach. And the plan I provided does just that, efficiently.

In summary, the optimal plan is:
1. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
3. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
4. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1
5. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
6. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
7. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
8. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
9. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
10. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
11. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
12. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
13. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

OK, I think this is the right plan.

One moment, I think there might still be an issue. I need to double check the unloadairplane operation. In the problem statement, it's defined as "loadairplane p ap l".

```
"loadairplane p ap l": Unload package p from airplane ap in location l.
```

This is confusing, since loadairplane has already been defined for loading. I think this is a typo, and it should be "unloadairplane p ap l". In my plan I was using the correct action, but I should make sure I have the correct format. 

Let's look at the actions list again. The actions are defined as:
```
"loadtruck p t l": Load package p in truck t. Both p and t are in location l.
"loadairplane p ap l": Load package p in airplane ap. Both p and ap are in location l.
"unloadtruck p t l": Unload package p from truck t in location l.
"loadairplane p ap l": Unload package p from airplane ap in location l.
"drivetruck t l_from l_to c": Drive truck t from location l_from to location l_to in city c.
"flyairplane ap l_from l_to": Fly airplane ap from location l_from to location l_to.
```

I see there's a type-o (mistake). `"loadairplane p ap l"` is repeated, with the second ocurrence being intended to mean `"unloadairplane p ap l"`. The clue is that the second description is:
```
"loadairplane p ap l": Unload package p from airplane ap in location l.
```

Note the word "Unload" in the description. So the correct action name should be `"unloadairplane p ap l"`. That's what I'll use in my plan.

Let me just fix the action names to ensure consistency with the problem statement's action format:
1. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
3. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
4. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1
5. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
6. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
7. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
8. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
9. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
10. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
11. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
12. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
13. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

Now one more thing:
I think I want to make sure I got the domains right. Let me go back to the original problem statement.

I notice this in the original statement:
```
"The actions of this domain have the following preconditions:
	"loadtruck": You may only load package p in a truck t if p and t are in the same location l.
	"loadairplane": You may only load package p in a airplane ap if ap and t are in the same location l."
```

Did you see that? In the loadairplane entry, the precondition says "if ap and t are in the same location l." This is odd. "t" looks like it is referring to a truck. I think this must also be a typo, and it should be "if ap and p (the package) are in the same location l."

I will assume it is indeed a typo, and the precondition for loadairplane actually requires the airplane and the package to be in the same location (not the airplane and a truck).

With this interpretation, my plan remains valid. p1 and a1 are both at l1_1 when I load p1 onto a1.

Alright, I believe the plan I have provided is optimal for the given problem.

1. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
3. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
4. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1
5. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
6. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
7. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
8. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
9. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
10. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
11. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
12. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
13. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

Actually, let's triple-check the plan

1. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1
   Preconditions: Truck t1 in l1_2; both l1_2 and l1_4 are in city c1. ✓
   Effects: Truck t1 is now in l1_4. ✓

2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
   Preconditions: Package p1 and truck t1 are both in location l1_4. ✓
   Effects: Package p1 is now in truck t1 and not in location l1_4. ✓

3. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
   Preconditions: Package p2 and truck t1 are both in location l1_4. ✓
   Effects: Package p2 is now in truck t1 and not in location l1_4. ✓

4. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1
   Preconditions: Truck t1 in l1_4; both l1_4 and l1_2 are in city c1. ✓
   Effects: Truck t1 is now in l1_2. ✓

5. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
   Preconditions: Truck t1 is in l1_2; package p2 is in truck t1. ✓

Wait, it looks like I got the action name wrong for "unloadairplane." I keep using "unloadairplane" but the action list actually has it as "loadairplane" (just with a description that says "Unload").

Let me fix this in my plan:
1. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
3. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
4. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1
5. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
6. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
7. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
8. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
9. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
10. loadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 (for unloading)
11. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
12. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
13. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

Well actually I'm still confused by this. Looking back at the original problem statement again:

```
"loadtruck p t l": Load package p in truck t. Both p and t are in location l.
"loadairplane p ap l": Load package p in airplane ap. Both p and ap are in location l.
"unloadtruck p t l": Unload package p from truck t in location l.
"loadairplane p ap l": Unload package p from airplane ap in location l.
```

The same action name is listed twice, once for loading and once for unloading. This isn't sensible. For the sake of clarity, I will assume that the second occurrence of "loadairplane" should be "unloadairplane".

So my plan uses:
10. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

But now I'm extra confused because the precondition section says:
```
"The actions of this domain have the following preconditions:
	"loadtruck": You may only load package p in a truck t if p and t are in the same location l.
	"loadairplane": You may only load package p in a airplane ap if ap and t are in the same location l.
	"unloadtruck": You may only unload package p from a truck t in a location l if (i) t is situated in l, and (ii) p is in t.
	"unloadairplane": You may only unload package p from a airplane ap in a location l if (i) ap is situated in l, and (ii) p is in ap."
```

This refers to "unloadairplane" and not a second "loadairplane" action. So I think my original intuition was correct, and that the action list should have "unloadairplane" not a duplicate "loadairplane".

So my plan continues to be:
1. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
3. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
4. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1
5. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
6. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
7. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
8. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
9. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
10. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
11. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
12. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
13. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
