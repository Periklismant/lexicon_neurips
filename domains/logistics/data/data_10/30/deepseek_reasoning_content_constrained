Okay, let's tackle this planning problem step by step. So, the goal is to get package p1 to l2_3 and p2 to l1_2, right? But there are a bunch of constraints we need to satisfy along the way. Let me first list out all the constraints to make sure I don't miss any.

First, the initial state: p1 and p2 are both in l1_4. The trucks t1 is in l1_2 (wait, wait, no—the original state says "Package t1 is in location l1_2". Wait, no, t1 is a truck, right? Wait, the objects include "truck t1" and "truck t2". So maybe there's a typo here. Looking back: "The original state of the world is the following: ... 'Package t1 is in location l1_2'...". Wait, that can't be right. Because t1 is a truck, not a package. Oh, this must be a mistake in the problem description. Because the objects are listed as package p1, p2; trucks t1, t2; airplanes a1, a2. So the original state says "Package t1 is in location l1_2"—that's probably a typo. It should be "Truck t1 is in location l1_2". Similarly for "Package t2 is in location l2_1"—probably Truck t2. And "Package a1 is in location l1_1"—Airplane a1. And "Package a2 is in location l2_1"—Airplane a2. Because otherwise, the initial state has trucks and airplanes as packages, which doesn't make sense. So assuming that's a typo, let's correct that mentally.

So initial state:

- Trucks: t1 in l1_2 (city c1), t2 in l2_1 (city c2).
- Airplanes: a1 in l1_1 (airport in c1), a2 in l2_1 (airport in c2).
- Packages p1 and p2 are in l1_4 (city c1).

Goal: p1 in l2_3 (city c2), p2 in l1_2 (city c1).

Constraints:

1. p2 must be in a1 at some state.
2. p1 must be in l2_1 at some state.
3. If p1 is in l2_1 in some state, then in an earlier state, either p1 is in l1_5 or p2 is in l1_2.
4. p1 must be in l1_5 at some state.
5. p2 must be in l1_5 at some state.
6. At some state, p1 is in l1_2 or l2_4.
7. At some state, either p2 is in l2_3 or p1 is in l1_3.
8. p1 must be in l1_4 (which is already true initially, but maybe needs to be there again after moving? Or does it count the initial state? The problem says "must hold in at least one state". So initial state satisfies this. But check if the constraint is that it must hold in at least one state, including the initial. So that's covered, but maybe during the plan it's moved and then maybe brought back? Wait, but the initial state is part of the states. So constraint 8 is already satisfied by the initial state. But the problem says "must hold in at least one state", so maybe the initial state counts. So we don't need to do anything for constraint 8. However, there's another constraint: if p1 is in l1_4 in some state s, then either p1 is in l2_5 or p2 is in l2_1 must hold in s or after. Since the initial state is s0 where p1 is in l1_4, then we need that either p1 ends up in l2_5 or p2 in l2_1 at s0 or later. But our goal is p2 in l1_2 and p1 in l2_3. So maybe during the plan, after moving p1 from l1_4, we need to ensure that either p1 goes to l2_5 (but the goal is l2_3) or p2 goes to l2_1 (but the goal is l1_2). So that's conflicting. Hmm. So this constraint says that whenever p1 is in l1_4 (including the initial state), then in that state or a later state, either p1 is in l2_5 or p2 is in l2_1. But in the initial state, p1 is in l1_4. So we need that at some point after the initial state, either p1 is in l2_5 or p2 is in l2_1. But the goal is p2 in l1_2. So if we have to make p2 go to l2_1 at some point, but then move it to l1_2, that could work. So maybe during the plan, we need to take p2 to l2_1, which is the airport in c2. Then move it back to c1? But how?

Other constraints:

9. p1 must be in a2 at some state.
10. p2 must be in l1_3 at some state.
11. p1 must be in l1_1 at some state.
12. If p1 is in l1_1 in some state, then in an earlier state, p1 was in l1_2.

So let's start planning.

First, the goal is to get p1 to l2_3 (c2) and p2 to l1_2 (c1). Since p1 starts in l1_4 (c1) and needs to go to c2. To move between cities, we need airplanes. So likely, we need to transport p1 via airplane from c1 to c2. But the airport in c1 is l1_1, and in c2 is l2_1. So p1 would need to be driven from l1_4 to l1_1 (airport) via truck, loaded onto airplane a1, flown to l2_1, then unloaded, then driven to l2_3. But wait, in c2, there's a truck t2 in l2_1. So perhaps t2 can drive p1 from l2_1 to l2_3. But l2_3 is in c2, so t2 can drive there. Similarly, p2 needs to go from l1_4 to l1_2. Since l1_4 and l1_2 are in c1, so truck t1 is in l1_2. So perhaps load p2 into t1 and drive it to l1_2. But wait, t1 is already in l1_2. So maybe drive to l1_4, load p2, then drive back. Wait, t1 starts in l1_2. To get p2 from l1_4, we need to drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_4 (since cities are c1, locations are l1_1 to l1_5). So t1 can drive from l1_2 to l1_4 via drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1. Then load p2 into t1, then drive back to l1_2 and unload.

But there are constraints that require p2 to be in a1 (airplane a1) at some point. So p2 must be loaded into a1. But a1 is in l1_1. So to get p2 into a1, we need to bring p2 to l1_1. But p2 is initially in l1_4, so maybe we need to drive it to l1_1 via truck. But that's in c1, so possible.

Wait, but the goal is to have p2 in l1_2. So if we first take p2 to l1_1 (airport) to load into a1, then unload it again, and then take it back to l1_2. But why would we do that? Because constraint 1 requires p2 to be in a1 at some state. So p2 must be loaded into a1, then maybe unloaded somewhere else. But that would complicate the plan.

Alternatively, maybe we can have p2 loaded into a1 in l1_1, then unloaded back into l1_1, then transported to l1_2. But that's possible. But how?

Let's list all the constraints again and see which ones need to be incorporated.

Constraints:

1. p2 in a1 (so load into a1, then maybe unload)
2. p1 in l2_1 (so part of the path to get to l2_3)
3. If p1 is in l2_1, then earlier p1 in l1_5 or p2 in l1_2. So when p1 is in l2_1, before that, either p1 was in l1_5 or p2 was in l1_2. But since the goal is p2 in l1_2, maybe p2 is moved to l1_2 before p1 arrives in l2_1. But how? Because p2 starts in l1_4. So maybe first move p2 to l1_2, which would satisfy the condition for when p1 later arrives in l2_1. That could work.
4. p1 in l1_5. So need to take p1 to l1_5 at some point.
5. p2 in l1_5. So need to take p2 to l1_5.
6. At least one of p1 in l1_2 or p1 in l2_4. So either of these must happen.
7. Either p2 in l2_3 (which is the goal for p1) or p1 in l1_3. Wait, but the goal is p1 in l2_3, so if during the plan p1 is in l1_3, that could satisfy this. Or if p2 ends up in l2_3 (but the goal for p2 is l1_2). So maybe during the plan, we need to have p1 in l1_3.
8. p1 in l1_4 (initial state is sufficient)
9. If p1 is in l1_4 (which is true initially), then in that state or after, p1 in l2_5 or p2 in l2_1. So since the initial state has p1 in l1_4, we need that either later p1 is in l2_5 or p2 is in l2_1. But the goal is p1 in l2_3 and p2 in l1_2, so we can't have p1 end in l2_5. So we need p2 to be in l2_1 at some point. But how? Because p2 is in c1, and l2_1 is in c2. So to get p2 to l2_1, we need to transport it via airplane. But the goal is to have p2 in l1_2. So maybe we take p2 from l1_4 to l1_1 (airport), load into a1, fly to l2_1, unload, then fly back? That seems complicated. But necessary to satisfy constraint 9.

Wait, constraint 9 says "The following expression must hold in at least one state: 'Package p1 is in a2'". So p1 must be loaded into a2. a2 is in l2_1. So to load p1 into a2, p1 must be in l2_1 (since a2 is there). So p1 would have to be in l2_1, then loaded into a2. But why would we do that if the goal is to have p1 in l2_3. So after loading into a2, perhaps we unload it again. But that's extra steps.

Also, constraint 11 requires p1 to be in l1_1. So p1 must be transported to l1_1. Which is the airport in c1. So perhaps p1 is taken to l1_1, then loaded into a1, flown to l2_1. But that would get p1 to l2_1. Then, from there, drive to l2_3.

But there's also constraint 12: if p1 is in l1_1 (which it must be at some point), then in an earlier state, p1 was in l1_2. So before p1 can be in l1_1, it must have been in l1_2. But p1 starts in l1_4. So how to get it to l1_1 via l1_2? So the path would be l1_4 -> l1_2 -> l1_1. So truck t1 is in l1_2. So drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_4, load p1 into t1, drive back to l1_2 (so now p1 is in l1_2), then drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1 (since l1_1 is in c1). Wait, can a truck drive to the airport? Yes, because airports are locations in the city. So truck t1 can drive from l1_2 to l1_1. Then unload p1 there. Then load into airplane a1 and fly to l2_1.

But this would satisfy constraint 12: p1 is in l1_1 (after being driven there from l1_2, which was after being moved from l1_4). So that's okay.

Let's start sketching the plan:

For p1:

1. Move p1 from l1_4 to l1_2 via truck t1.

But wait, t1 is in l1_2. So to get to l1_4, need to drive t1 to l1_4. So steps:

- drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1 (drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_4)
- loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4 (load p1 into t1)
- drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1 (drive back to l1_2)
- unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 (now p1 is in l1_2, satisfying constraint 12's precondition for when it's moved to l1_1)
- drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 (drive t1 to airport)
- unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (p1 now in l1_1)
- loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1 (load into a1)
- flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (fly to c2's airport)
- unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 (p1 in l2_1, satisfying constraint 2)
- Now, need to get p1 to l2_3. t2 is in l2_1. So load p1 into t2, drive to l2_3, unload.

But also, constraint 9 requires p1 to be in a2. a2 is in l2_1. So perhaps after unloading p1 from a1 in l2_1, load it into a2, then unload again. Then put into truck.

But that adds steps. Let's see:

After unloading p1 from a1 into l2_1:

- loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (so p1 is in a2, satisfying constraint 9)
- unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (p1 back in l2_1)
- loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (load into t2)
- drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
- unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (goal achieved)

But this adds steps. Alternatively, maybe load p1 into a2 directly. Wait, a2 is in l2_1. So after flying a1 to l2_1, p1 is there. Then load into a2 (which is at l2_1), fly somewhere else? Not necessary. Just load and unload in l2_1.

But this would satisfy constraint 9 (p1 in a2). So the steps would be:

After unloading p1 from a1 into l2_1:

- loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
- unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
- then proceed to load into t2.

But that's two extra steps. But necessary to meet constraint 9.

So for p1, the steps would involve:

- Drive t1 to l1_4, load p1, drive back to l1_2, unload. Then drive to l1_1, unload, load into a1, fly to l2_1, unload. Then load into a2 (satisfy constraint 9), unload, load into t2, drive to l2_3, unload.

Now for p2:

p2 needs to go from l1_4 to l1_2. But also, constraints require:

- p2 in a1 (constraint 1)
- p2 in l1_5 (constraint5)
- p2 in l1_3 (constraint10)
- Also, constraint3: when p1 is in l2_1, which happens after flying, there must have been an earlier state where p1 was in l1_5 or p2 was in l1_2. Since p1 is moved to l1_2 before being taken to l1_1, then when p1 is in l2_1, the earlier state where p2 was in l1_2 is not yet achieved (since p2 is in l1_4 initially). So maybe need to move p2 to l1_2 first. But the goal is p2 in l1_2, so maybe that's the way. So if p2 is moved to l1_2 first, then when p1 arrives in l2_1, the condition is satisfied because p2 was in l1_2 earlier. So perhaps the plan for p2 is to first move it to l1_2, but that's the goal. But there are other constraints for p2: needs to be in l1_5, l1_3, and a1. So p2 must be moved around.

So maybe:

p2 starts in l1_4.

Steps:

- Drive t1 to l1_4, load p2, drive to l1_5 (satisfy constraint5), unload. Then drive to l1_3 (satisfy constraint10), load p2, drive to l1_1 (airport), unload, load into a1 (satisfy constraint1), fly to some location (maybe l2_1?), unload, but then need to get p2 back to l1_2. Wait, but p2's goal is l1_2. So maybe after loading into a1 in l1_1, fly to l2_1, unload. Then load into a2 (but a2 is in l2_1), fly back to l1_1? But that's complicated. Or perhaps fly a1 with p2 to l2_1, unload, then fly back. But then need to get p2 back to c1.

Alternatively, after loading p2 into a1 at l1_1, fly to l2_1 (unload there), but then how to get p2 back to c1. Maybe use airplane a2 to fly p2 back. But that's more steps.

Alternatively, after loading p2 into a1 at l1_1, fly to l1_1 again? No, that's the same location. Hmm.

Alternatively, after loading p2 into a1 in l1_1, fly to another airport? But airports are only in l1_1 and l2_1. So if a1 is flown to l2_1, then p2 is in l2_1. Then need to bring it back to c1. But that would require another airplane. But there's a2 in l2_1. So load p2 into a2, fly to l1_1, unload, then drive to l1_2.

But this seems very involved. Let's think step by step.

Constraints for p2:

- Must be in a1 (so loaded into a1)
- Must be in l1_5
- Must be in l1_3
- Must be in l1_2 (goal)
- Also, constraint3: when p1 is in l2_1, which is after flying, there must have been an earlier state where p1 was in l1_5 or p2 in l1_2. So if we move p2 to l1_2 before p1 is moved to l2_1, then that satisfies the condition. But moving p2 to l1_2 is the goal. But we also have to take p2 to l1_5 and l1_3, which are other locations.

So perhaps the sequence for p2 is:

1. Move p2 from l1_4 to l1_5 using truck t1.

But t1 is initially in l1_2. So first, drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_4, load p2, drive to l1_5, unload. Then drive to l1_3, load p2, drive to l1_2 (goal), unload. But then p2 is in l1_2. But we also need to get p2 into a1. So after moving p2 to l1_2, how to get it into a1. So maybe after that, drive t1 to l1_1, load p2 into a1, then unload again.

But that would involve:

After p2 is in l1_2 (goal):

- drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
- loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (wait, but p2 is in l1_2. So we need to have t1 in l1_2 to load p2. Wait, if p2 is in l1_2, and t1 is in l1_2, then load p2 into t1, then drive to l1_1, unload. Then load into a1.

But this would require:

- loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (since both are there)
- drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
- unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
- loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
- then maybe fly a1 somewhere, but since we need p2 to end in l1_2, perhaps unload it back. But that would require flying back.

This is getting complicated. Let's try to outline the entire plan, considering all constraints.

Let's start with the initial state:

- p1 and p2 are in l1_4.
- t1 is in l1_2 (c1), t2 in l2_1 (c2).
- a1 in l1_1 (c1), a2 in l2_1 (c2).

First, handle p1's constraints and movement.

For p1:

Need to move to l2_3 via l1_2, l1_1, l2_1, and ensure:

- p1 is in l1_5 (constraint4)
- p1 is in l1_1 (constraint11), which requires having been in l1_2 earlier.
- p1 is in a2 (constraint9)
- Also, constraint6: p1 in l1_2 or l2_4. Since moving p1 through l1_2 would satisfy that.
- constraint7: p2 in l2_3 (not possible as p2's goal is l1_2) or p1 in l1_3. So need to move p1 to l1_3 at some point.

But wait, this adds more steps. So maybe:

1. Move p1 from l1_4 to l1_5 (to satisfy constraint4).
   - To do this, need a truck in l1_4. t1 is in l1_2. So drive t1 to l1_4, load p1, drive to l1_5, unload.

But then p1 is in l1_5. Then move it to l1_2 (to satisfy the path to l1_1). So drive t1 back to l1_2, unload p1. Now p1 is in l1_2 (satisfies constraint6 as p1 is in l1_2). Then drive t1 to l1_1, unload p1. Then load into a1, fly to l2_1, unload. Then load into a2 (satisfy constraint9), unload, load into t2, drive to l2_3.

But also, need to have p1 in l1_3 (to satisfy constraint7). So maybe after moving p1 to l1_5, drive it to l1_3, then to l1_2, etc. But this adds more steps.

Alternatively, after moving p1 to l1_5 (satisfy constraint4), then move to l1_3 (satisfy constraint7), then to l1_2 (for constraint12), then to l1_1, etc.

But this is getting very involved. Let's see:

Steps for p1:

1. Drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_4.
2. Load p1 into t1 at l1_4.
3. Drive t1 to l1_5, unload p1 (now p1 in l1_5, satisfies constraint4).
4. Drive t1 to l1_5 to l1_3 (assuming locations are connected? Are all locations in a city connected? The problem says trucks can move between locations in the city, so yes.
5. Load p1 into t1 at l1_5.
6. Drive t1 to l1_3, unload p1 (now p1 in l1_3, satisfies constraint7).
7. Then drive t1 to l1_2 (maybe via l1_3 to l1_2? Are the locations sequential? The problem doesn't specify connectivity, but since it's a city, assume trucks can move between any locations in the same city.
8. Load p1 into t1 at l1_3.
9. Drive t1 to l1_2, unload p1 (now p1 in l1_2, satisfies constraint6).
10. Now, to get p1 to l1_1 (constraint11), need to drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1.
11. Unload p1 at l1_1 (satisfies constraint11, and the earlier state where p1 was in l1_2 satisfies constraint12).
12. Load p1 into a1 at l1_1.
13. Fly a1 to l2_1.
14. Unload p1 from a1 into l2_1 (satisfies constraint2).
15. Now, need to load p1 into a2 (constraint9). a2 is in l2_1.
16. Load p1 into a2 at l2_1.
17. Unload p1 from a2 into l2_1.
18. Load p1 into t2 at l2_1.
19. Drive t2 to l2_3.
20. Unload p1 into l2_3 (goal achieved).

Now, for p2:

Constraints:

- Must be in a1 (constraint1)
- Must be in l1_5 (constraint5)
- Must be in l1_3 (constraint10)
- Must be in l1_2 (goal)
- Also, during p1's movement to l2_1 (step14), p2 must have been in l1_2 earlier (constraint3). But in the current plan, p2 is still in l1_4. So we need to move p2 to l1_2 before step14.

So perhaps, after moving p1 to l1_5, we can start moving p2.

But let's think:

Initial state: p2 in l1_4.

To get p2 to l1_2 (goal), but also need to satisfy:

- p2 in l1_5 (constraint5)
- p2 in l1_3 (constraint10)
- p2 in a1 (constraint1)

So possible steps:

1. Drive t1 (which is in l1_2 initially) to l1_4 (after step1 in p1's plan, t1 is in l1_4, then steps for p1 take t1 to l1_5, l1_3, l1_2, etc. So maybe during p1's movement, t1 is busy. Alternatively, use another truck? Wait, there's only t1 in c1 and t2 in c2. So for p2 in c1, we have to use t1. But t1 is being used for p1's movements. So we need to interleave the steps.

This is getting complicated. Let's try to outline the entire plan step by step, considering both packages and constraints.

Here's a tentative plan:

1. **Move t1 to l1_4 to pick up p1 and p2**:
   - drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1

2. **Load p1 into t1**:
   - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

3. **Drive t1 to l1_5**:
   - drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1

4. **Unload p1 in l1_5** (constraint4):
   - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5

5. **Load p2 into t1** (since p2 is still in l1_4, but t1 is in l1_5. Wait, no. After step1, t1 is in l1_4. Steps 2-4 are for p1. After step4, t1 is in l1_5, but p2 is still in l1_4. So this approach won't work. Maybe need to first handle p2's movements.

Alternative approach:

Since both p1 and p2 start in l1_4, maybe use t1 to move them both.

But t1 can only carry one package at a time, unless the problem allows multiple packages. The problem doesn't specify, but the actions are per package. So each package needs to be loaded and unloaded individually.

So perhaps:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1 (t1 arrives at l1_4)
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
3. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1 (move p1 to l1_5)
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 (p1 in l1_5, constraint4)
5. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1 (return to l1_4 to get p2)
6. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
7. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1 (move p2 to l1_5, constraint5)
8. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
9. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1 (move to l1_3)
10. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5? No, p2 is in l1_5. So need to load from l1_5 to t1, then drive to l1_3.

Wait, after step8, p2 is in l1_5. So:

9. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 (t1 is in l1_5)
10. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1
11. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (constraint10)
12. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1 (move to l1_2)
13. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (goal for p2)
14. Now, p2 is in l1_2, which satisfies constraint3 for when p1 arrives in l2_1.

But then, we also need to load p2 into a1 (constraint1). So after step13, p2 is in l1_2. To load into a1 (which is in l1_1), need to drive p2 to l1_1.

But how? p2 is in l1_2, so:

15. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (t1 is in l1_2)
16. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
17. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
18. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (constraint1)
19. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (now p2 is in l2_1)
20. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
21. Now, need to get p2 back to l1_2. So load into a2 (which is in l2_1):
22. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
23. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
24. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
25. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
26. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
27. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (goal)

But this adds a lot of steps. Also, during this time, p1 is in l1_5 (step4), needs to be moved to l2_3.

Continuing with p1's steps:

After step4, p1 is in l1_5.

But t1 is busy moving p2. So need to use another truck? No, there's only t1 in c1. So this approach may not work due to truck contention.

This suggests that the plan needs to interleave the movements of p1 and p2, sharing the truck t1.

Alternatively, perhaps after moving p1 to l1_5, move p2 to l1_5, then move both to other locations.

But this is getting very complex. Let's try to outline a possible sequence that meets all constraints.

Plan Outline:

1. **Move t1 to l1_4**:
   - drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1

2. **Load p1 into t1**:
   - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4

3. **Drive t1 to l1_5**:
   - drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1

4. **Unload p1 in l1_5** (constraint4):
   - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5

5. **Drive t1 back to l1_4**:
   - drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1

6. **Load p2 into t1**:
   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

7. **Drive t1 to l1_5**:
   - drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1

8. **Unload p2 in l1_5** (constraint5):
   - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

9. **Load p2 into t1 again**:
   - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5

10. **Drive t1 to l1_3**:
    - drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1

11. **Unload p2 in l1_3** (constraint10):
    - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

12. **Load p2 into t1 again**:
    - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

13. **Drive t1 to l1_2**:
    - drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1

14. **Unload p2 in l1_2** (goal for p2, satisfies constraint3 when p1 later is in l2_1):
    - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

15. **Now handle p1, who is in l1_5**:

    a. **Drive t1 to l1_5** (t1 is in l1_2 after step13, need to drive to l1_5):
        - drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_5 c1

    b. **Load p1 into t1**:
        - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5

    c. **Drive t1 to l1_3** (to satisfy constraint7 if needed, but earlier steps may have already covered it):
        - drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1

    d. **Unload p1 in l1_3** (satisfies constraint7):
        - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3

    e. **Load p1 into t1 again**:
        - loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3

    f. **Drive t1 to l1_2**:
        - drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1

    g. **Unload p1 in l1_2** (to satisfy constraint12 for later moving to l1_1):
        - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2

16. **Move p1 to l1_1**:

    a. **Drive t1 to l1_1**:
        - drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1

    b. **Unload p1 in l1_1** (constraint11):
        - unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

17. **Load p1 into a1**:
    - loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1

18. **Fly a1 to l2_1**:
    - flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

19. **Unload p1 in l2_1** (constraint2):
    - unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1

20. **Load p1 into a2** (constraint9):
    - loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

21. **Unload p1 from a2**:
    - unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

22. **Load p1 into t2**:
    - loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

23. **Drive t2 to l2_3**:
    - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2

24. **Unload p1 in l2_3** (goal achieved).

But wait, during this time, p2 is in l1_2 (step14). However, we need to satisfy constraint1 (p2 in a1). So after step14, p2 is in l1_2. We need to load it into a1 which is in l1_1. So:

25. **Drive t1 from l1_1 (where it is after step16a) back to l1_2** (but t1 is in l1_1 after step16a):

    a. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1

26. **Load p2 into t1**:
    - loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

27. **Drive t1 to l1_1**:
    - drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1

28. **Unload p2 in l1_1**:
    - unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

29. **Load p2 into a1** (constraint1):
    - loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

30. **Fly a1 to l2_1** (optional, but need to unload p2 somewhere. But the goal is p2 in l1_2. So perhaps unload p2 back into l1_1):

31. **Unload p2 from a1 back into l1_1**:
    - flyairplane a1 l1_1 l1_1 (can't fly to same location? Or maybe just unload without flying? No, fly requires moving. So perhaps fly to l2_1, then fly back.

But this complicates things. Alternatively, after loading p2 into a1 (step29), fly to l2_1, unload, then fly back to l1_1. But this requires:

30. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

31. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

Now p2 is in l2_1 (satisfies the constraint9's condition? No, constraint9 is about p1 in a2. But for p2, this is part of the steps to get it into a1 (constraint1). But now p2 is in l2_1. To get it back to l1_2, need to load into a2:

32. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

33. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

34. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

35. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

36. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1

37. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

But this adds many steps, making the plan very long. However, the problem asks for an optimal plan (shortest possible). So perhaps there's a way to minimize steps.

Alternatively, after step29 (load p2 into a1), we can unload it back into l1_1 without flying. But according to the actions, you can't unload unless you're in the same location. So if a1 is in l1_1, you can unload p2 there. But why load and then immediately unload? Because it satisfies the constraint that p2 is in a1 at some state.

So:

29. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (now p2 is in a1, satisfying constraint1)

30. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (p2 back in l1_1)

31. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

32. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1

33. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (goal)

This way, steps 29-33 handle getting p2 into a1 and back to l1_2.

But this would add steps after the p1 has already been moved to l2_3. But need to ensure that all constraints are met.

This is getting very complex. Let's try to count the steps and ensure all constraints are met.

Constraints Checklist:

1. p2 in a1: step29 (loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1)
2. p1 in l2_1: step19 (unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1)
3. If p1 is in l2_1, then earlier state with p1 in l1_5 or p2 in l1_2. In our plan, p1 arrives in l2_1 at step19. Earlier, p2 is in l1_2 at step14, which is before step19. So this is satisfied.
4. p1 in l1_5: step4 (unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5)
5. p2 in l1_5: step8 (unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5)
6. p1 in l1_2 or l2_4: step14 (p1 unloaded in l1_2 at step14g)
7. p2 in l2_3 or p1 in l1_3: p1 is in l1_3 at step11 (unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3) or p1 in l1_3 step11 (wait, no—step11 is for p2. Wait, in the initial plan, p1 is moved to l1_3 in step15d. So that's after step14. But step7 is about having either p2 in l2_3 or p1 in l1_3. Since p1 is in l1_3 at step15d, this satisfies constraint7.
8. p1 in l1_4: initial state, satisfied.
9. If p1 in l1_4 (initial state), then p1 in l2_5 or p2 in l2_1. After initial state, p2 is moved to l2_1 at step31 (unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1). So this satisfies the condition.
10. p1 in a2: step20 (loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1)
11. p2 in l1_3: step11 (unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3)
12. p1 in l1_1: step16b (unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1)
13. If p1 in l1_1, then earlier state p1 in l1_2: step14g (unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2) before step16b.

So all constraints are met.

Now, let's list the entire plan step by step, ensuring that each action's preconditions are met.

Final Plan Steps:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
3. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
5. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1
6. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
7. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1
8. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
9. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
10. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1
11. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
12. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
13. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1
14. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
15. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_5 c1
16. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
17. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1
18. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
19. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
20. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1
21. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
22. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
23. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
24. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
25. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
26. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
27. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
28. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
29. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
30. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
31. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
32. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
33. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
34. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
35. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
36. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
37. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
38. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
39. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
40. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

But this is a very long plan. However, the problem asks for an optimal plan, which is as short as possible. This suggests that perhaps there's a shorter way to satisfy all constraints.

Alternatively, perhaps some steps can be merged or optimized.

For example, after moving p2 to l1_2 (step14), instead of moving it again to l1_1, maybe use a different approach to load it into a1.

But given the constraints, especially the one requiring p2 to be in a1, it's unavoidable to move p2 to l1_1 to load into a1.

Alternatively, after p2 is in l1_2 (step14), drive t1 to l1_2, load p2, drive to l1_1, unload, load into a1, then unload back into l1_1, then drive back to l1_2.

This would add steps but satisfy the constraint.

But this plan may not be optimal. Let's think of a shorter way.

Alternative approach:

Maybe combine moving p1 and p2 in the same truck trips.

For example:

1. Drive t1 to l1_4, load both p1 and p2 (but actions are per package).

Wait, but each load action is per package. So:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
3. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (possible? Yes, since both packages are in l1_4 and t1 is there.
But the problem doesn't state that trucks can carry multiple packages, but actions are per package. So each package must be loaded individually.

So steps:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
3. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
4. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1
5. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5 (constraint4)
6. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5 (constraint5)
7. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1
8. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
9. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
10. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1
11. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3 (constraint7)
12. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3 (constraint10)
13. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1
14. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
15. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
16. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1
17. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 (to later move to l1_1)
18. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (goal for p2)
19. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
20. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1 (constraint11)
21. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
22. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
23. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1 (constraint2)
24. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (constraint9)
25. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
26. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
27. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
28. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (goal for p1)
29. Now handle p2's constraint1: load into a1.

But p2 is in l1_2. So:

30. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
31. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
32. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
33. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
34. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (constraint1)
35. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (optional, but need to keep p2 in l1_2)
36. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
37. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
38. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

But this still results in many steps. However, this approach reduces some steps by loading both packages in the same truck trips where possible. But I'm not sure if this is shorter.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a more optimal path by leveraging airplanes for multiple tasks.

Another idea: Since p1 needs to be in a2 (constraint9) which is in l2_1, and p1 also needs to be in l2_3, maybe after flying to l2_1, load into a2 and then fly to l2_3's airport? Wait, l2_3 is not an airport. Airports are l1_1 and l2_1. So no, can't fly directly. Must use truck t2 to move from l2_1 to l2_3.

Another possible optimization: After moving p1 to l2_1 (step23), instead of loading into a2 and unloading, maybe just load into t2 directly. But then how to satisfy constraint9 (p1 in a2). So must load into a2.

So steps 24-25 are necessary.

But perhaps after unloading from a2, immediately load into t2.

So:

24. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (constraint9)
25. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
26. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
27. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
28. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

This is necessary.

For p2, after step18 (in l1_2), need to load into a1. So steps:

29. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
30. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
31. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
32. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (constraint1)
33. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
34. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
35. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
36. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

This adds 8 steps for p2, but they are necessary to meet constraint1.

Overall, the plan is long, but given the constraints, it's necessary.

Now, let's check if all constraints are satisfied:

- p2 in a1: step32
- p1 in l2_1: step23
- When p1 is in l2_1 (step23), earlier p2 was in l1_2 (step18)
- p1 in l1_5: step5
- p2 in l1_5: step6
- p1 in l1_2: step17 (before being moved to l1_1)
- p1 in l1_3: step11
- p1 in l1_4: initial state
- After initial state (p1 in l1_4), p2 is moved to l2_1 in step33 (unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1? No, step33 is unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1. So p2 is in l1_1. To satisfy the constraint that after p1 is in l1_4, p1 is in l2_5 or p2 is in l2_1. But in this plan, p2 is in l2_1 only if we fly it there. But in the current steps, p2 is unloaded into l1_1 (step33), not l2_1. So this would not satisfy the constraint. Wait, the constraint says that if p1 is in l1_4 in some state s, then either p1 is in l2_5 or p2 is in l2_1 must hold at s or after. Since p1 starts in l1_4 (s0), then in some state after s0, p2 must be in l2_1 or p1 in l2_5. But p1 is moved to l2_3, not l2_5. So p2 must be in l2_1 at some point. In the current plan, p2 is loaded into a1 and unloaded into l1_1 (step33), so never in l2_1. This violates the constraint. So this plan is invalid.

Ah, here's a critical mistake. The constraint requires that after the initial state (where p1 is in l1_4), either p1 must be in l2_5 or p2 must be in l2_1 at some point. In the current plan, p2 is never in l2_1, so we need to have p2 in l2_1 at some point.

Thus, the previous approach is invalid. So we must find a way to get p2 to l2_1.

This complicates things further. So to satisfy this, after loading p2 into a1 (step32), we need to fly a1 to l2_1, unload p2 there, then fly back.

Thus:

32. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (constraint1)
33. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
34. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (now p2 is in l2_1, satisfying the constraint)
35. Now, to get p2 back to l1_2, load into a2:
36. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
37. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
38. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
39. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
40. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
41. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

This adds more steps but ensures p2 is in l2_1 (step34), satisfying the constraint.

Now, with these steps, the constraint that after the initial state, p2 is in l2_1 (step34) is satisfied.

This makes the plan even longer, but it's necessary.

Final steps incorporating this:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_4 c1
2. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_4
3. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1
4. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
5. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_4 c1
6. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
7. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_5 c1
8. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
9. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_5
10. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1
11. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
12. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
13. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1
14. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
15. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_5 c1
16. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_5
17. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_3 c1
18. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
19. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_3
20. drivetruck t1 l1_3 l1_2 c1
21. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2
22. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
23. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1
24. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1
25. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
26. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1
27. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
28. unloadairplane p1 a2 l2_1
29. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1
30. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
31. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
32. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
33. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
34. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
35. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
36. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1
37. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1
38. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1
39. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1
40. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1
41. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1
42. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
43. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
44. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

This plan now satisfies all constraints, but it's very long. However, given the numerous constraints and the requirement to move packages between cities and satisfy various intermediate conditions, this may be the minimal steps required.

But perhaps there's a smarter way to combine steps. For example, after step38 (unload p2 from a1 into l2_1), maybe use a2 to fly p2 back to l1_1 and then to l1_2.

But regardless, the key is to ensure all constraints are met and the plan is valid.

Finally, I'll present the plan in the required format, ensuring that each action is correctly sequenced and all preconditions are met.
