Let me analyze the problem:

We have a logistics problem with cities, locations, airports, trucks, airplanes, and packages. 

First, let me clarify the objects in the world:
- Cities: c1, c2
- Locations in city c1: l1_1 (airport), l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5
- Locations in city c2: l2_1 (airport), l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5
- Packages: p1, p2
- Trucks: t1, t2
- Airplanes: a1, a2

The initial state seems to have some errors. It says:
- "Package t1 is in location l1_2" - t1 is a truck, not a package
- "Package t2 is in location l2_4" - t2 is a truck, not a package
- "Package a1 is in location l1_1" - a1 is an airplane, not a package
- "Package a2 is in location l2_1" - a2 is an airplane, not a package

I'll assume these are mistakes and the correct initial state is:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_2
- Truck t2 is in location l2_4
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1
- Package p1 is in location l2_3
- Package p2 is in location l1_1

The goal is to:
- Move package p1 to location l2_5
- Move package p2 to location l1_2

Let's develop a plan:

For package p1:
1. Currently, p1 is in location l2_3 (city c2)
2. We need to move it to location l2_5 (city c2)
3. Since both locations are in the same city, we can use truck t2

For package p2:
1. Currently, p2 is in location l1_1 (city c1)
2. We need to move it to location l1_2 (city c1)
3. Since both locations are in the same city, we can use truck t1

Let's create the plan:

For package p1 using truck t2:
1. Drive truck t2 from location l2_4 to location l2_3
2. Load package p1 in truck t2 at location l2_3
3. Drive truck t2 from location l2_3 to location l2_5
4. Unload package p1 from truck t2 at location l2_5

For package p2 using truck t1:
1. Drive truck t1 from location l1_2 to location l1_1
2. Load package p2 in truck t1 at location l1_1
3. Drive truck t1 from location l1_1 to location l1_2
4. Unload package p2 from truck t1 at location l1_2

Combined plan:
1. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
3. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
5. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
6. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
7. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
8. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

However, I notice these steps can be done in parallel, so to optimize the plan, I could reorder them this way:
1. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
2. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2
3. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
4. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
5. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
6. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2
7. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
8. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

This should be optimal as we're using the minimum number of actions to achieve the goals.

Let's review for any mistakes:

I'm using the correct action names and syntax. Each action follows the proper format and only occurs when its preconditions are met.

I'm noticing something though... the problem statement had a typo in the action list. It listed "loadairplane" twice, once where "unloadairplane" should be. I've used the correct actions in my plan regardless of this typo.

Since the objects in the world already have trucks and airplanes at locations conducive to our plan, and there's no constraint requiring use of airplanes, I've opted for the simplest solution using only trucks. This makes sense given that all movements are within the same city for each package.

Assuming the initial state is as I interpreted (with trucks and planes, not packages t1, t2, a1, a2), this plan should be optimal.

Actually, let me double-check the actions and effects to ensure I understand correctly.

The actions are:
- "loadtruck p t l": Load package p in truck t at location l
- "loadairplane p ap l": Load package p in airplane ap at location l
- "unloadtruck p t l": Unload package p from truck t at location l
- "unloadairplane p ap l": Unload package p from airplane ap at location l
- "drivetruck t l_from l_to c": Drive truck t from location l_from to location l_to in city c
- "flyairplane ap l_from l_to": Fly airplane ap from location l_from to location l_to

The preconditions and effects make sense and are as expected.

Given the corrected initial state and the actions available, my plan above should be optimal. It uses the minimum necessary moves to get the packages to their destinations.

Let me review the plan once more:

For package p1:
1. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2 (Move truck to where p1 is)
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (Load p1 onto the truck)
3. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2 (Move truck to destination)
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (Unload p1 at destination)

For package p2:
1. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1 (Move truck to where p2 is)
2. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (Load p2 onto the truck)
3. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1 (Move truck to destination)
4. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (Unload p2 at destination)

This plan should accomplish the goals efficiently.

However, I just realized there's a potential issue with the initial state description. Let me re-read it carefully:

"Package t1 is in location l1_2"
"Package t2 is in location l2_4"
"Package p1 is in location l2_3"
"Package p2 is in location l1_1"
"Package a1 is in location l1_1"
"Package a2 is in location l2_1"

This seems to be describing t1, t2, a1, and a2 as packages, which contradicts the object definitions. Let me reconsider the problem.

Since the problem specifically lists "truck t1", "truck t2", "airplane a1", and "airplane a2" as objects, I believe the initial state description has errors. These should be trucks and airplanes, not packages.

If we assume the correct initial state is:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_2
- Truck t2 is in location l2_4
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1
- Package p1 is in location l2_3
- Package p2 is in location l1_1

Then my plan above is correct. However, if we take the initial state literally:
- Package t1 is in location l1_2
- Package t2 is in location l2_4
- Package p1 is in location l2_3
- Package p2 is in location l1_1
- Package a1 is in location l1_1
- Package a2 is in location l2_1

Then we have no information about where the trucks and airplanes are, which makes planning impossible.

Given the context and the fact that the problem is asking for a logistics plan, I believe the first interpretation is correct. The initial state description has typographical errors, and t1, t2, a1, and a2 should be trucks and airplanes, not packages.

Based on this understanding, my plan above remains valid and optimal.

Ah, I actually reread the problem statement more carefully. The "objects" are explicitly defined as "truck t1", "truck t2", etc. The initial state is describing the locations of these objects. I think the terms "Package t1", "Package t2", etc. in the initial state are definitely typos, and they should be "Truck t1", "Truck t2", "Airplane a1", "Airplane a2", etc.

So, with this understanding, my plan remains valid:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
2. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
3. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
4. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
5. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2
6. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
7. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2
8. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

This plan satisfies the goal by moving p1 to location l2_5 and p2 to location l1_2.

One last thing to note: in a real-world scenario, these actions could be performed in parallel (e.g., both trucks can move simultaneously). However, for the purpose of this planning problem, I'm presenting a sequential plan. If parallel actions are allowed, then actions 1-4 and 5-8 can be executed in parallel.

Let me recheck:

1. We need to move p1 from l2_3 to l2_5.
2. We need to move p2 from l1_1 to l1_2.

The plan above accomplishes both of these goals using the minimum number of actions for each package. Therefore, it is optimal.

Actually, I observe that we could potentially optimize step 5. I've written the plan out in order of operations for p2 first (steps 1-4), then p1 (steps 5-8), which makes it easy to understand. However, if we're aiming to minimize the maximum number of steps, we could have the trucks move simultaneously:

1. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
2. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2
3. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
4. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
5. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
6. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2
7. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
8. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

This way, both packages are delivered in 8 total operations, with both operations happening concurrently when possible.

In summary, the plan is:

```
drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
```

This plan is optimal considering the constraints and initial state of the problem.

Ah, wait. I realize the prompt is asking for the length of the execution of the plan (i.e. the number of actions that need to be performed), not the total sum of all operations. Let me try to reduce this.

Actually, I double-checked my plan again. Each action is necessary to achieve the goal, given the initial state. We need to:
- Move each truck to the location of each package
- Load each package onto a truck
- Move each truck to the destination
- Unload each package at the destination

That's 8 actions in total, and we can't reduce it further if we're working with the two packages separately.

Actually, I'm wondering if there's a more optimal solution. Let's reconsider the problem from scratch.

Starting conditions:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_2
- Truck t2 is in location l2_4
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (airport in city c1)
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1 (airport in city c2)
- Package p1 is in location l2_3
- Package p2 is in location l1_1

Goal:
- Package p1 to location l2_5
- Package p2 to location l1_2

For p1, we need to move it from l2_3 to l2_5. Both are in city c2. The most direct route is to use truck t2, which involves:
1. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
3. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

For p2, we need to move it from l1_1 to l1_2. Both are in city c1. The most direct route is to use truck t1, which involves:
1. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
2. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
3. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
4. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

Total: 8 actions.

Now, let's consider if there's any way to reduce the number of actions.

We could potentially use the airplanes, but that would involve additional actions:
- Flying the airplane to an airport
- Loading the package onto the airplane
- Flying the airplane to another airport
- Unloading the package

Since both packages are to be moved within the same city, using airplanes would only increase the number of actions, not decrease them.

Could we use one truck for both packages? This would involve moving the truck between cities, which requires:
- Driving the truck to an airport
- Loading the truck onto an airplane
- Flying the airplane to another city
- Unloading the truck at the destination airport
- Continuing with the delivery

This would involve many more actions than the 8 we have.

Could we have one of the packages move the other? No, packages cannot perform actions.

It seems the 8-action plan is optimal. Each package requires 4 actions to be moved to its destination, and we can't reduce that number given the constraints of the problem.

To summarize, the optimal plan is:

```
drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2
loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2
unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
```

This plan delivers both packages to their destinations in 8 actions.

One last check: Are the preconditions for each action met?

1. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1
   - t1 is in l1_2 (initial state)
   - l1_2 and l1_1 are in city c1 (object definitions)
   Preconditions met.

2. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2
   - t2 is in l2_4 (initial state)
   - l2_4 and l2_3 are in city c2 (object definitions)
   Preconditions met.

3. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1
   - p2 is in l1_1 (initial state)
   - t1 is in l1_1 (after action 1)
   Preconditions met.

4. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
   - p1 is in l2_3 (initial state)
   - t2 is in l2_3 (after action 2)
   Preconditions met.

5. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1
   - t1 is in l1_1 (after action 1)
   - l1_1 and l1_2 are in city c1 (object definitions)
   Preconditions met.

6. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_5 c2
   - t2 is in l2_3 (after action 2)
   - l2_3 and l2_5 are in city c2 (object definitions)
   Preconditions met.

7. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2
   - t1 is in l1_2 (after action 5)
   - p2 is in t1 (after action 3)
   Preconditions met.

8. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
   - t2 is in l2_5 (after action 6)
   - p1 is in t2 (after action 4)
   Preconditions met.

All preconditions are met. The plan is valid and optimal.
