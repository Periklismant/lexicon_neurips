Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. The goal is to get p1 to l2_5 and p2 to l1_2 while satisfying all the constraints. First, I need to understand the initial state and all the constraints. Let's break it down step by step.

Initial State:
- Cities c1 and c2 each have multiple locations. Airports are l1_1 (c1) and l2_1 (c2).
- Packages:
  - p1 is at l2_3 (city c2)
  - p2 is at l1_1 (c1's airport)
- Trucks:
  - t1 is at l1_2 (c1)
  - t2 is at l2_4 (c2)
- Airplanes:
  - a1 is at l1_1 (c1's airport)
  - a2 is at l2_1 (c2's airport)

Goal:
- p1 at l2_5 (c2)
- p2 at l1_2 (c1)

Constraints are numerous. Let's list them out:

1. At some state, p2 is in a2 and p1 is in l1_2.
2. At some state, p2 is in l2_3.
3. At some state, p2 is in l1_2 (which is the goal, so this is covered).
4. If p2 is in l1_2 in some state, then earlier p1 must be in l2_1 or l1_5.
5. At some state, p2 is in a1.
6. At some state, p2 is in l1_4.
7. At some state, either p1 is in a2 or p2 is in l2_2.
8. At some state, p2 is in a2.
9. At some state, p1 is in a2.
10. At some state, p1 is in l2_4.
11. At some state, p1 is in l2_3 (which is the initial position, so already satisfied).
12. If p1 is in l2_3 in state s, then p2 must be in l1_1 at s or after.

Wait, constraint 11 is that p1 is in l2_3 at some state. But p1 starts there. So that's already met. But the 12th constraint says whenever p1 is in l2_3 in any state s, then p2 must be in l1_1 at s or after. Since the initial state has p1 in l2_3, then p2 must be in l1_1 either in the initial state (which it's not, p2 is in l1_1 initially? Wait, initial state says p2 is in l1_1. Wait, the original state says:

Wait, original state says "Package p2 is in location l1_1". So in the initial state, p2 is at l1_1 (c1's airport). So the 12th constraint is that whenever p1 is in l2_3 (which is its initial location), then p2 must be in l1_1 either at that state or later. Since the initial state has p1 in l2_3 and p2 in l1_1, that's already satisfied. But if p1 moves away and then comes back to l2_3 later, then we need to ensure that when that happens, p2 is in l1_1 at that time or after. However, given the goal is to have p1 in l2_5 (c2), which is in city c2. So maybe p1 doesn't need to return to l2_3 after moving. So perhaps the initial state already satisfies the 12th constraint's condition. Hmm, but the constraint is that if in any state s, p1 is in l2_3, then p2 is in l1_1 in s or after. Since in the initial state s0, p1 is in l2_3 and p2 is in l1_1, that's okay. If later p1 is moved back to l2_3, then p2 must be in l1_1 at that time or after. But since the goal requires p2 to end up in l1_2, which is in c1, maybe we need to make sure that when p1 is in l2_3 again (if ever), p2 is either in l1_1 or gets there later. But since the plan might not involve moving p1 back to l2_3 after moving it away, perhaps this constraint is already satisfied by the initial state and the steps taken. So maybe we don't have to worry about that unless the plan requires p1 to be back in l2_3. Let's note that and proceed.

Now, let's think about the steps needed for p1 and p2.

Starting with p1: It's in l2_3 (c2). Needs to go to l2_5 (c2). So within c2, maybe use truck t2, which is at l2_4. So, first, drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_3, load p1 into t2, then drive t2 to l2_5, unload p1. That seems straightforward. But wait, t2 is in l2_4. So drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_3 (possible since they are in c2), load p1 into t2, then drive to l2_5, unload.

But let's check the constraints. The constraints require that p1 is in a2 (constraint 9), in l2_4 (constraint 10), and also in l2_3 (already covered). Also, the 7th constraint requires that at some state, either p1 is in a2 or p2 is in l2_2. So moving p1 into a2 would satisfy that. Also, constraint 9 requires p1 in a2. So maybe we need to involve airplane a2 (which is at l2_1) to carry p1. But how?

Wait, p1 is in l2_3 (c2). To get it into a2 (airplane), which is at l2_1 (c2's airport), we need to transport p1 to l2_1. Let's see: use truck t2 (at l2_4) to drive to l2_3, load p1, drive to l2_1 (but can trucks move to airports? Since airports are locations in the city. The drivetruck action allows moving between locations in the same city. So yes. So t2 can drive from l2_3 to l2_1 (since both are in c2). Then unload p1 at l2_1, load into a2, then fly a2 to l2_5's airport? Wait, l2_5 is a regular location, not an airport. Wait, the airports are l1_1 and l2_1. So airplanes can only fly between airports. So if we need to get p1 to l2_5, which is a regular location in c2, perhaps we need to fly a2 to l2_1 (but that's where it starts), no. Wait, a2 is already at l2_1. So load p1 into a2, then fly to another airport? But the only other airport is l1_1 in c1. But l2_5 is in c2. So perhaps using the airplane isn't helpful here. Alternatively, maybe the plan is to use the truck to move p1 from l2_3 to l2_5 via l2_4 and l2_5.

Wait, cities have locations connected by trucks. So in c2, t2 can drive between any locations. So l2_3 to l2_4 to l2_5? Or is there a direct path? The drivetruck action can move between any two locations in the same city. So t2 can drive from l2_3 to l2_5 directly if possible. Wait, the locations in c2 are l2_1 (airport), l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5. So perhaps the truck can drive from l2_3 to l2_5 directly.

But let's check the constraints. For p1, we need to have it in a2 (constraint 9), in l2_4 (constraint 10), and in l2_3 (already initial). So to satisfy constraint 10, p1 must be in l2_4 at some point. So perhaps after loading p1 into t2 at l2_3, drive t2 to l2_4 (where t2 is originally located?), wait, no, t2 is at l2_4 initially. Wait, initial state says "Package t2 is in location l2_4". Wait, wait, the original state lists "Package t2 is in location l2_4". Wait, no, looking back:

Wait, original state says:

"Package t1 is in location l1_2"

"Package t2 is in location l2_4"

Wait, that's a mistake. Because t1 and t2 are trucks, not packages. The user might have made a typo. Wait, the original state lists:

"The original state of the world is the following:
...
	"Package t1 is in location l1_2"
	"Package t2 is in location l2_4"
	"Package p1 is in location l2_3"
	"Package p2 is in location l1_1"
	"Package a1 is in location l1_1"
	"Package a2 is in location l2_1"

Wait, this seems incorrect. Because t1 and t2 are trucks, a1 and a2 are airplanes. The user probably intended:

"Truck t1 is in location l1_2"

"Truck t2 is in location l2_4"

"Airplane a1 is in location l1_1"

"Airplane a2 is in location l2_1"

But the user wrote "Package t1", etc. This is a problem. But assuming that's a typo, and the correct initial positions are:

- Truck t1 is at l1_2 (c1)
- Truck t2 is at l2_4 (c2)
- Airplane a1 is at l1_1 (c1's airport)
- Airplane a2 is at l2_1 (c2's airport)

But given that the problem is presented as such, we have to proceed with the given initial state. So according to the original state:

- t1 (a package?) is at l1_2. But that's conflicting because t1 is a truck. Wait, this must be a mistake. The user probably mixed up "Package" and "Truck" in the original state. Let's re-examine:

Original state entries:

"Package t1 is in location l1_2"

"Package t2 is in location l2_4"

"Package p1 is in location l2_3"

"Package p2 is in location l1_1"

"Package a1 is in location l1_1"

"Package a2 is in location l2_1"

This is definitely incorrect because t1, t2 are trucks, a1, a2 are airplanes, and p1, p2 are packages. So the correct initial positions should be:

- Truck t1 is at l1_2

- Truck t2 is at l2_4

- Airplane a1 is at l1_1

- Airplane a2 is at l2_1

- Package p1 is at l2_3

- Package p2 is at l1_1

But the user wrote them as packages. This is a critical error. However, since we have to work with the given information, perhaps it's a formatting mistake. Let's assume that the user intended:

The original state is:

- Truck t1 is in location l1_2

- Truck t2 is in location l2_4

- Package p1 is in location l2_3

- Package p2 is in location l1_1

- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1

- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

Otherwise, the problem doesn't make sense because trucks and airplanes can't be packages. So proceeding with that corrected understanding.

So, initial positions:

Trucks:

- t1 in l1_2 (c1)

- t2 in l2_4 (c2)

Airplanes:

- a1 in l1_1 (c1's airport)

- a2 in l2_1 (c2's airport)

Packages:

- p1 in l2_3 (c2)

- p2 in l1_1 (c1's airport)

Now, let's proceed.

For p2 to get to l1_2 (c1). Since p2 is at l1_1 (c1's airport), which is in c1. So we can use truck t1, which is at l1_2. So truck t1 needs to go to l1_1, load p2, then drive back to l1_2 and unload. But t1 is at l1_2. So first, drive t1 from l1_2 to l1_1 (airport), load p2, then drive back to l1_2, unload. That would get p2 to l1_2. But let's check constraints for p2.

Constraints for p2:

- Must be in a2 and p1 in l1_2 at some state (constraint 1).

- Must be in l2_3 (constraint 2).

- Must be in l1_2 (goal, covered).

- Must be in a1 (constraint 5).

- Must be in l1_4 (constraint 6).

- Must be in a2 (constraint 8).

- Also, constraint 7 requires either p1 in a2 or p2 in l2_2.

Additionally, the fourth constraint: if p2 is in l1_2 (the goal), then earlier p1 must be in l2_1 or l1_5.

So for p2's journey, we need to have it pass through several locations and airplanes.

But p2 starts at l1_1 (c1's airport). The goal is l1_2 (c1). So normally, just load into truck t1 (which is at l1_2), drive to l1_1, load p2, drive back. But that's too simple, but the constraints complicate things.

Wait, let's outline the steps for p2:

From l1_1 (airport in c1), needs to go to l1_2.

But to satisfy constraints, p2 must be in a2 (airplane), l2_3 (c2), l1_4 (c1), etc. So we need to move p2 through multiple locations and possibly between cities.

How to do that? Let's see.

First, since p2 is in c1's airport (l1_1), perhaps we can load it into airplane a1 (which is at l1_1), fly to l2_1 (c2's airport), unload into a2, then move via truck in c2 to l2_3, then back to c1? But that's complicated, but maybe necessary to meet the constraints.

But let's think step by step.

Constraints that require p2 to be in:

- a2 (constraint 1 and 8)

- l2_3 (constraint 2)

- l1_4 (constraint 6)

- a1 (constraint 5)

So p2 needs to be in a1 (c1's airport), which is already its initial location. Wait, no: p2 is at l1_1 (which is the airport in c1), and a1 is also at l1_1. So to load p2 into a1, we can do loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1. Then fly a1 to another airport (l2_1), unload p2 there, then perhaps load into a2, etc.

But why would we need to do that? Because the constraints require p2 to be in a1, which can be achieved by loading it into a1 at l1_1. Then if we unload it back to l1_1, that's redundant. But if we fly a1 to l2_1, then unload p2 into l2_1 (c2's airport), which is a different city. Then, to get p2 to l2_3 (c2), we can use truck t2 (which is at l2_4) to drive to l2_1, load p2, drive to l2_3, unload. Then maybe take it back to c1 via airplane, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the plan involves moving p2 from l1_1 (c1) to l2_1 (c2) via a1, then via truck to l2_3, then back to c1 via a2, and then to l1_4 and finally l1_2.

But the goal is to have p2 in l1_2. So this seems like a long way, but maybe necessary to meet all constraints.

Similarly, for p1, which is in l2_3 (c2), needs to get to l2_5 (c2). But the constraints require p1 to be in a2 (airplane), l2_4, etc.

So let's outline possible steps:

For p1:

1. Move p1 from l2_3 to l2_4 using truck t2 (since t2 is at l2_4, drive to l2_3, load, drive to l2_4, unload. This satisfies constraint 10 (p1 in l2_4).

2. Then load p1 into truck t2 again, drive to l2_1 (c2's airport), unload.

3. Load p1 into airplane a2, fly to l1_1 (c1's airport), unload. Then load into a1 and fly back? Not sure. Alternatively, fly a2 to l2_1 (but it's already there). Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe:

For p1:

- Load into truck t2 at l2_3, drive to l2_1 (airport), unload.

- Load into a2, fly to l2_1 (no, same location), so maybe fly to another airport? Only l1_1. So fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1 (c1's airport), unload p1 there. Then in c1, load p1 into truck t1, drive to l1_5 (to satisfy the fourth constraint when p2 is in l1_2). Then from l1_5, maybe take it back to c2 via airplane? But the goal is l2_5. So this seems convoluted.

Alternatively, after getting p1 into a2 (satisfying constraint 9), fly a2 to l2_1 (but it's already there). Wait, perhaps after loading p1 into a2 at l2_1, fly a2 to l2_1 (no movement), which doesn't help. Alternatively, if a2 is at l2_1, loading p1 into a2, then flying to l2_1 (no), so maybe this approach isn't helpful.

Alternatively, for p1, use truck t2 to move it to l2_4 (satisfy constraint 10), then to l2_5 (goal). But that would not involve airplanes. However, constraints require p1 to be in a2 (airplane). So perhaps after moving p1 to l2_4, load into truck t2, drive to l2_1 (airport), load into a2, then fly a2 to l2_1 (no movement), unload, then drive to l2_5. But that doesn't help. Alternatively, fly a2 to another airport, but the only other is l1_1. So fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1 with p1, then unload, but that moves p1 to c1, which is opposite of the goal (l2_5 is in c2). So this seems counterproductive.

This suggests that maybe p1's path must involve being loaded into a2 in c2, then flown somewhere, but not sure. Maybe another approach.

Wait, the seventh constraint requires that either p1 is in a2 or p2 is in l2_2. So if we can get p1 into a2, that satisfies it. Also, constraint 9 requires p1 in a2. So we need to load p1 into a2.

But a2 is in l2_1 (c2's airport). So to load p1 into a2, p1 must be in l2_1. So we need to move p1 from l2_3 to l2_1 using truck t2. Then load into a2. Then fly a2 somewhere else, but where? If we fly to l1_1, then p1 is in c1, which is not helpful. Alternatively, just load into a2 and keep it there, but then how to get to l2_5. Alternatively, after loading into a2, fly to l2_1 (no movement), unload, then use truck to move to l2_5. But that's redundant.

Alternatively, after loading p1 into a2 at l2_1, fly a2 to another airport (only l1_1). Then unload p1 in l1_1, but that's in c1. Then use truck t1 to move to l1_5 (satisfying constraint 4 when p2 is in l1_2). Then load into a1, fly back to l2_1, unload, then truck to l2_5. This is getting very complicated, but maybe necessary.

But this is getting too long. Let's try to outline steps for both packages, considering all constraints.

Let's start with p2:

p2 needs to go from l1_1 to l1_2. But to meet constraints, it must be in a1, a2, l2_3, l1_4, etc.

Possible steps for p2:

1. Load p2 into a1 at l1_1 (satisfies constraint 5: p2 in a1).

2. Fly a1 to l2_1 (c2's airport).

3. Unload p2 into l2_1.

4. Load p2 into a2 (satisfies constraint 8: p2 in a2).

5. Fly a2 to l1_1 (c1's airport).

6. Unload p2 into l1_1.

7. Load p2 into truck t1 (which is at l1_2; need to drive t1 to l1_1).

8. Drive t1 back to l1_2, unload p2 (goal).

But along the way, p2 would have been in a1 (step 1), a2 (step4), l2_1 (step3), l1_1 (step6). But also need to get p2 to l2_3 and l1_4.

So maybe after step3 (p2 in l2_1), use truck t2 to move p2 to l2_3:

But t2 is at l2_4. Drive t2 to l2_1, load p2, drive to l2_3, unload (satisfies constraint 2: p2 in l2_3). Then maybe load into a2 again.

But then how to get to l1_4? Let's see:

After p2 is in l2_3 (c2), maybe fly it back to c1. But airplanes can only go between airports. So load p2 into a2 at l2_1 (after moving it there via truck), fly to l1_1, then use truck t1 to move to l1_4.

But this is getting very involved. Let's try to outline a step-by-step plan.

Plan Outline:

For p1:

1. Move p1 from l2_3 to l2_4 (using t2) to satisfy constraint 10.

   a. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_3.

   b. Load p1 into t2.

   c. Drive t2 to l2_4.

   d. Unload p1 (now p1 is in l2_4).

2. Move p1 to l2_1 (c2's airport) to load into a2.

   a. Drive t2 from l2_4 to l2_1.

   b. Unload p1 into l2_1.

   c. Load p1 into a2 (satisfies constraint 9: p1 in a2 and constraint7: either p1 in a2 or p2 in l2_2).

3. Fly a2 to l1_1 (c1's airport) to possibly move p1 to c1, but goal is l2_5. Hmm, not helpful. Alternative: leave p1 in a2 at l2_1, then unload and use truck to move to l2_5.

Wait, but if a2 is at l2_1, and p1 is in a2, then unload p1 into l2_1, then use truck t2 to drive to l2_5.

So:

   a. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l2_1 (no, can't). Wait, airplanes can only fly between different airports. So a2 is already at l2_1. To move p1 to l2_5, we can't use the airplane. So perhaps after step2c (p1 in a2 at l2_1), unload p1 into l2_1, then drive t2 to l2_1, load p1, drive to l2_5, unload.

So steps for p1:

1. t2 drives to l2_3, loads p1, drives to l2_4, unloads (p1 in l2_4, satisfies constraint10).

2. t2 drives to l2_4 to l2_1, loads p1, drives to l2_1, unloads (p1 in l2_1).

3. Load p1 into a2 (now p1 in a2, satisfies constraints7 and9).

4. Unload p1 from a2 into l2_1.

5. t2 drives to l2_1, loads p1, drives to l2_5, unloads (goal).

But step4 is unnecessary if we can fly a2 to another airport. But since l2_5 is not an airport, the airplane can't help. So truck is needed.

For p2:

Need to move from l1_1 to l1_2, but via various locations.

Steps for p2:

1. Load p2 into a1 at l1_1 (satisfies constraint5: p2 in a1).

2. Fly a1 to l2_1 (c2's airport).

3. Unload p2 into l2_1 (now p2 in l2_1).

4. Load p2 into a2 (satisfies constraint8: p2 in a2).

   Now, with p2 in a2, and p1 in a2 (from p1's step3), this also satisfies constraint1: p2 in a2 and p1 in a2 (but need p1 in l1_2 for constraint1? Wait, constraint1 says "The following conditions are all true: "Package p2 is in a2", "Package p1 is in location l1_2". So both must be true in the same state.

Wait, constraint1 requires that in at least one state, both p2 is in a2 and p1 is in l1_2. So we need a state where both are true. But p1's goal is l2_5, so unless we move p1 to l1_2 temporarily, which is in c1, but p1 is in c2. How can p1 be in l1_2? That would require moving p1 from c2 to c1, which would involve an airplane.

So maybe in the plan, after p1 is in a2 (step3), fly a2 to l1_1 (c1's airport), unload p1 there, then load into truck t1 (which is at l1_2, so drive t1 to l1_1, load p1, drive back to l1_2. Then, at that point, p1 is in l1_2, and if p2 is in a2, then constraint1 is satisfied.

But this complicates p1's path. Let's see:

For p1:

After step3 (p1 loaded into a2 at l2_1):

4. Fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1 (c1's airport).

5. Unload p1 into l1_1.

6. Drive truck t1 from l1_2 to l1_1.

7. Load p1 into t1.

8. Drive t1 to l1_2, unload p1 (now p1 is in l1_2).

At this state, if p2 is in a2 (which is now at l1_1 after flying), then constraint1 is satisfied (p2 in a2 and p1 in l1_2). But p2 would have been unloaded into l1_1 in step3 of p2's plan. Wait, no:

Wait, p2's steps:

1. p2 loaded into a1 at l1_1.

2. Fly a1 to l2_1.

3. Unload p2 into l2_1.

4. Load p2 into a2 (now a2 is at l2_1).

5. Fly a2 to l1_1 (with p1 loaded earlier).

At this point, a2 is at l1_1, p2 is in a2 (since it was loaded in step4 and flown to l1_1). So when a2 arrives at l1_1, p2 is in a2 (still in a2). Then, after unloading p1 into l1_1, p1 is moved to l1_2 via truck t1. So during the time when a2 is at l1_1 with p2 inside, and p1 is in l1_2, that would satisfy constraint1 (p2 in a2 and p1 in l1_2).

But then we need to get p2 back to l1_1 to then move to l1_2. So after that, unload p2 from a2 into l1_1, then load into truck t1 and drive to l1_2.

But this is getting very tangled. Let's try to outline the entire plan step by step, ensuring all constraints are met.

Comprehensive Plan Outline:

1. Move p1 from l2_3 to l2_4 using t2 to satisfy constraint10.

   a. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2

   b. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

   c. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2

   d. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

2. Move p1 to l2_1 to load into a2.

   a. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2

   b. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

   c. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_1 c2 (wait, can't drive to same location. So maybe unload at l2_1.

   Wait, after step1d, p1 is in l2_4. So step2:

   a. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2 (t2 moves to l2_1)

   b. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (but p1 is in l2_4, not in l2_1. Wait, no. After step1d, p1 is in l2_4. So to load p1 into t2, t2 must be in l2_4. So perhaps:

   After step1d (p1 in l2_4, t2 in l2_4):

   a. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

   b. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2

   c. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (now p1 is in l2_1)

3. Load p1 into a2 at l2_1.

   a. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

4. Fly a2 to l1_1 to move p1 to c1.

   a. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

   Now, a2 is at l1_1 with p1 inside.

5. Unload p1 from a2 into l1_1.

   a. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

6. Load p1 into truck t1 (which is at l1_2, need to drive to l1_1).

   a. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1

   b. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

   c. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1

   d. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2 (now p1 is in l1_2, satisfying part of constraint1)

   At this point, if p2 is in a2 (which is now at l1_1), then constraint1 (p2 in a2 and p1 in l1_2) is met. But p2's current state:

   Initially, p2 is at l1_1. Let's track p2's movements.

For p2:

7. Load p2 into a1 at l1_1.

   a. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (satisfies constraint5: p2 in a1)

8. Fly a1 to l2_1.

   a. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

9. Unload p2 into l2_1.

   a. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

10. Load p2 into a2 (which is at l2_1 after step4? No, a2 was flown to l1_1 in step4. So at this point, a2 is at l1_1. So step7-10: after flying a1 to l2_1, p2 is in l2_1. To load into a2, a2 must be in l2_1. But after step4, a2 is at l1_1. So this won't work. So this approach has a flaw.

Alternative approach for p2:

Let's adjust the steps to ensure that when we load p2 into a2, a2 is present.

Alternative Plan:

After step4, a2 is at l1_1 with p1. Then, to get p2 into a2, we need to have a2 at l2_1.

But this is conflicting. So perhaps the order of steps needs adjustment.

Alternative approach:

First, handle p2's constraint to be in a2 and l2_3.

1. Move p2 from l1_1 to l2_1 via a1.

   a. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (constraint5 met)

   b. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

   c. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (now p2 in l2_1)

2. Load p2 into a2 at l2_1 (constraint8 met)

   a. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

3. Fly a2 to l1_1 to meet constraint1 (p2 in a2 and p1 in l1_2)

   a. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

   Now, a2 is at l1_1 with p2 inside.

4. Meanwhile, handle p1's steps to get it to l1_2.

   But p1 is in l2_3 initially. To get to l1_2, need to move to c1.

   a. In c2: load p1 into truck t2, drive to l2_1.

   b. load into a2, fly to l1_1.

   c. unload, load into truck t1, drive to l1_2.

   So steps:

   a. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2

   b. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

   c. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

   d. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

   e. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

   f. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

   g. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

   h. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1

   i. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

   j. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1

   k. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2

   Now, p1 is in l1_2. At this point, a2 is at l1_1 with p2 inside (from step3). So the state after step3 and stepk would have p2 in a2 and p1 in l1_2, satisfying constraint1.

Then, to get p2 to l1_2, we need to unload it from a2 into l1_1, then load into truck t1 and drive to l1_2.

But wait, a2 is at l1_1 with p2 inside. So:

5. Unload p2 from a2 into l1_1.

   a. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

6. Load p2 into truck t1 (which is at l1_2 after stepj).

   Need to drive t1 to l1_1 again.

   a. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1

   b. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

   c. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1

   d. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (goal met for p2)

But along the way, we need to satisfy other constraints for p2:

- p2 must be in l2_3 (constraint2). But in this plan, p2 is only in l2_1 (after step1c) and then moved to l1_1. So we need to get p2 to l2_3.

So perhaps after step1c (p2 in l2_1), we can use truck t2 to move p2 to l2_3.

Let's insert steps:

After step1c:

1c. p2 is in l2_1.

Insert:

1d. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2 (t2 was at l2_4 initially)

1e. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

1f. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2

1g. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (constraint2 met)

Now p2 is in l2_3.

Then proceed to step2: load p2 into a2, but a2 is at l2_1. So need to move p2 from l2_3 to l2_1 again.

But that's possible.

Continuing:

1h. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

1i. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (step2)

Then fly a2 to l1_1 (step3).

This adds more steps but satisfies constraint2.

Also, constraint12 requires that if p1 is in l2_3 in any state, then p2 must be in l1_1 at that state or after. Since p1 starts in l2_3 and is moved out, and p2 is moved to l1_1 later, this is satisfied.

Additionally, constraint4: if p2 is in l1_2 (goal), then earlier p1 must be in l2_1 or l1_5. In our plan, p1 is in l2_1 when it's unloaded there (stepd), which is before p2 is in l1_2. So that's satisfied.

Other constraints:

- p2 in l1_4 (constraint6): Not yet addressed. So we need to get p2 to l1_4 at some point.

- p2 in l2_3 (done).

- p2 in a1 (step1a), a2 (step2), l1_1 (step5), l1_2 (goal).

- p2 in l1_4: So somewhere, p2 must be in l1_4.

So after p2 is in l1_1 (step5), before moving to l1_2, we need to move it to l1_4.

So after step5:

5. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

6. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1

7. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

8. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

9. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4 (constraint6 met)

10. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1

11. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2 (goal)

But this adds steps to get p2 to l1_4.

Also, constraint7 requires that either p1 is in a2 or p2 is in l2_2. In our plan, p1 is loaded into a2 (stepe) and then flown to l1_1 (stepf), unloaded (stepg). So during stepf, a2 is flying with p1, but after that, p1 is in l1_1. So to satisfy constraint7, we need to ensure that either p1 is in a2 at some state or p2 is in l2_2. Since p1 is in a2 during steps e-f (from l2_1 to l1_1), that satisfies constraint7.

Now, let's check all constraints:

1. p2 in a2 and p1 in l1_2: Achieved when a2 is at l1_1 with p2 inside (after step3) and p1 is in l1_2 (after stepk).

2. p2 in l2_3: Achieved in step1g.

3. p2 in l1_2: Goal.

4. If p2 in l1_2, then earlier p1 in l2_1 or l1_5: p1 was in l2_1 (stepd) before p2 reaches l1_2.

5. p2 in a1: Achieved in step1a.

6. p2 in l1_4: Achieved in step9.

7. p1 in a2 or p2 in l2_2: p1 was in a2 during steps e-f.

8. p2 in a2: Achieved in step2.

9. p1 in a2: Achieved in step e.

10. p1 in l2_4: Achieved in step1d.

11. p1 in l2_3: Initial state.

12. If p1 in l2_3, then p2 in l1_1 at or after: Initial state has p1 in l2_3 and p2 in l1_1. Later, p2 moves to other places but returns to l1_1 in step5, which is after the initial state. So satisfied.

Now, putting all the steps together:

Plan Steps:

For p1:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2

2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

3. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2

4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

5. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

6. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2

7. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

8. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

9. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

10. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

11. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1

12. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

13. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1

14. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2

For p2:

15. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

16. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

17. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

18. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_1 c2 (wait, t2 is at l2_1 after step7. So can drive to l2_1 again? No, need to load p2 into t2.

Wait, after step17, p2 is in l2_1. So:

18. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_1 c2 (no, same location). Instead, load p2 into t2 at l2_1.

But t2 is at l2_1 after step7. So:

18. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

19. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2

20. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3

21. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

22. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

23. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

24. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

25. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

26. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1

27. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

28. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

29. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

30. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1

31. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

This is a lot of steps. But we need to ensure that all actions are possible and preconditions are met.

But this seems overly long. Perhaps there's a more optimal way. Let's look for possible optimizations.

For example, after p1 is loaded into a2 (step8), fly a2 to l1_1 (step9), then unload p1 (step10). Then, truck t1 is driven to l1_1 (step11), load p1 (step12), drive back (step13), unload (step14). This gets p1 to l1_2.

For p2, after being unloaded into l2_1 (step17), load into truck t2 (step18), drive to l2_3 (step19), unload (step20), then drive back to l2_1 (step21), unload (step22), load into a2 (step23), fly to l1_1 (step24), unload (step25). Then, truck t1 is driven to l1_1 (step26), load p2 (step27), drive to l1_4 (step28), unload (step29), then drive to l1_2 (step30), unload (step31).

This satisfies all constraints but results in a very long plan. However, the problem asks for an optimal plan, which is the shortest possible. So maybe there's a shorter way.

Alternative approach: Find a way to satisfy multiple constraints with fewer steps.

For example, when p2 is in l2_1 (after step17), instead of moving it to l2_3 and back, perhaps use a different path.

But constraint2 requires p2 to be in l2_3. So we must move p2 to l2_3 at least once.

Another idea: When p2 is in l2_1 (step17), use truck t2 to move it to l2_3 (satisfy constraint2), then load into a2 there. But a2 is at l2_1. So no, can't load into a2 unless it's at l2_3, which is not an airport.

Alternatively, after moving p2 to l2_3, move it to l2_1 again to load into a2.

This is necessary.

But maybe combine some steps.

For example, after step17 (p2 in l2_1), steps18-22 can be:

18. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

19. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2

20. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (constraint2)

21. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

22. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

23. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

This is necessary.

Similarly, moving p2 to l1_4:

After p2 is unloaded into l1_1 (step25), use truck t1 to move it to l1_4 before reaching l1_2.

Yes.

But this seems necessary.

Now, checking if all constraints are met:

- constraint1: p2 in a2 and p1 in l1_2. This occurs after step24 (a2 at l1_1 with p2 inside) and step14 (p1 in l1_2). So during the state after step14 and before step25, both conditions hold.

- constraint2: p2 in l2_3 achieved in step20.

- constraint3: p2 in l1_2 (goal).

- constraint4: when p2 is in l1_2 (step31), earlier p1 was in l2_1 (step7).

- constraint5: p2 in a1 (step15).

- constraint6: p2 in l1_4 (step29).

- constraint7: p1 in a2 (step8-9).

- constraint8: p2 in a2 (step23-24).

- constraint9: p1 in a2 (step8-9).

- constraint10: p1 in l2_4 (step4).

- constraint11: p1 in l2_3 (initial state).

- constraint12: Whenever p1 is in l2_3 (initial state), p2 is in l1_1 (after step25 or later).

Thus, all constraints are satisfied.

Now, to write the plan in order, interleaving steps for p1 and p2 as needed.

But actions must be ordered sequentially. Let's try to sequence the steps correctly.

The correct order must respect dependencies. For example, p1 must be loaded into a2 before a2 flies to l1_1.

Let's outline the plan step by step, ensuring correct ordering:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2 (move t2 to p1's location)

2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

3. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2

4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (p1 in l2_4)

5. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

6. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2 (t2 to l2_1)

7. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1 (p1 in l2_1)

8. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1 (p1 in a2)

9. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (a2 with p1 moves to l1_1)

10. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1 (p2 in a1)

11. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1 (a1 with p2 to l2_1)

12. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1 (p2 in l2_1)

13. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (t2 is at l2_1)

14. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2

15. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3 (p2 in l2_3)

16. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

17. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

18. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (a2 is at l1_1 now, wait no! After step9, a2 is at l1_1. So step18 is impossible because a2 is not at l2_1 anymore.

This is a critical error. After step9, a2 is at l1_1. So step18 can't load p2 into a2 at l2_1 because a2 is no longer there.

This means the previous approach is flawed. This highlights the importance of sequencing actions correctly.

So, we need to adjust the plan to ensure that when we load p2 into a2, a2 is at l2_1.

Revised plan outline:

For p1:

1. Move p1 to l2_1 and load into a2.

2. Fly a2 to l1_1.

For p2:

3. Load into a1, fly to l2_1, unload.

4. Load into a2 (which is at l2_1 before flying).

But after step2, a2 is at l1_1. So steps for p2 must happen before step2.

So correct order:

Handle p2's loading into a2 before moving a2.

Revised steps:

For p1:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2

2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

3. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2

4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

5. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4

6. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2

7. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

8. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

For p2:

9. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

10. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

11. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

12. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1

Now, a2 is at l2_1 with both p1 and p2 loaded? No, can't load two packages into the same airplane unless actions are concurrent, which they are not. So this approach is invalid.

This indicates that the previous plan is not feasible. Therefore, we need to rethink the entire strategy.

Alternative Idea:

Since both p1 and p2 need to be in a2, but at different times.

Maybe first load p2 into a2, fly to l1_1, then load p1 into a2.

But p1 is in c2. Let's try:

For p2:

1. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1

2. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1

3. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1

4. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1 (a2 is at l2_1)

5. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1 (p2 in a2 at l1_1)

6. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1

For p1:

7. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_3 c2

8. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3

9. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2

10. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1

11. loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1

12. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1

13. unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1

14. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1

15. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1

16. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1

17. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2

For p2:

After step6, p2 is in l1_1. Then:

18. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1

19. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1

20. drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1

21. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4

22. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_2 c1

23. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_2

This way, a2 is used for both p1 and p2, but not at the same time. However, step4 loads p2 into a2 at l2_1, then step5 flies a2 to l1_1. Then step11 loads p1 into a2 at l2_1 again, but a2 is at l1_1 after step5. So this is impossible.

Thus, the plan is invalid. Therefore, a different approach is needed.

Final Approach:

Given the complexity, perhaps the optimal plan is as follows, focusing on satisfying constraints with minimal steps:

For p1:

- Use truck t2 to move p1 from l2_3 to l2_4 (constraint10).

- Then to l2_1, load into a2 (constraint9).

- Fly a2 to l2_1 (no movement), then unload and use truck to l2_5.

Wait, no. Alternatively, after loading into a2, fly a2 to l2_1's airport (already there), unload, then use truck to l2_5.

But then p1's path is:

1. t2 drives to l2_3, loads p1.

2. Drives to l2_4, unloads (constraint10).

3. Drives to l2_1, unloads.

4. Load into a2 (constraint9).

5. Unload from a2 into l2_1.

6. Load into truck t2, drive to l2_5, unload (goal).

This satisfies p1's goal.

For p2:

- Load into a1 (constraint5), fly to l2_1.

- Unload, load into a2 (constraint8).

- Fly a2 to l1_1, unload.

- Load into truck t1, drive to l1_4 (constraint6), then to l1_2 (goal).

- Also, ensure that when p2 is in l1_2, p1 was in l2_1 earlier (constraint4).

Additionally, need to meet constraint1 (p2 in a2 and p1 in l1_2).

This requires p1 to be in l1_2 and p2 in a2 at the same time.

But p1's goal is l2_5, so unless p1 is temporarily moved to l1_2, which is in c1, this is impossible. Thus, perhaps the plan must involve moving p1 to l1_2 temporarily.

This suggests a very involved plan, but given the constraints, it's necessary.

Given the time constraints, I'll proceed to write the optimal plan based on the earlier outline, ensuring all constraints are met, even if it's lengthy.
