Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. So, the goal is to get p1 to l2_3 and p2 to l2_8, but they have a bunch of constraints we need to satisfy along the way. Let me start by understanding the initial state and all the constraints.

First, the initial state: p1 is in l2_5 (city c2), p2 is in l2_8 (also c2). Trucks t1 is in l1_8 (c1), t2 in l2_2 (c2). Airplanes a1 in l1_1 (c1's airport), a2 in l2_1 (c2's airport). The goal is p1 at l2_3 and p2 remains at l2_8. Wait, but p2 is already there. So maybe the main task is moving p1 from l2_5 to l2_3. But the constraints complicate things.

Looking at the constraints:

1. p1 must be in t2 at some state. Then, if that's true, either p2 is in t1 or l2_2 must hold in that state or later.

2. At least one of p1 in l2_7 or p2 in t1 must hold at some state.

3. p1 must be in l2_1 at some state.

4. Either p2 in l1_3 or p1 in l1_4 must hold at some state.

5. Either p2 in l2_6 or p1 in l1_6 must hold.

6. p1 must be in l2_5 (already true initially, but maybe needs to be there again after moving? Or does the initial state count? The problem says "in at least one state", so initial state counts. So that constraint is already satisfied. But wait, the problem says the constraints must be met in the plan. So maybe we need to make sure that even if p1 moves away and comes back, but the initial state might already satisfy it. Let's check the problem statement again. The original state has p1 in l2_5, so the constraint "p1 is in l2_5" is already met in the initial state. But the user might require that this condition is part of the plan's states. Wait, the constraints are for the plan's execution. So if the initial state is part of the plan's states, then this constraint is satisfied. So that one might not need any action. But the problem says "a valid plan must abide by the following constraints". So if the initial state is part of the plan, then that's okay. So that constraint is already satisfied. But the other constraints need to be checked during the plan.

7. If p1 is in l2_5 in some state s (like the initial state), then either p2 is in a1 or l1_5 must hold at s or after. Since the initial state s0 has p1 in l2_5, then after s0, in some state, p2 must be in a1 or l1_5. But p2 starts in l2_8. So we need to move p2 to a1 or l1_5 at some point after the initial state. But wait, the goal requires p2 to be in l2_8. So if we move p2 to a1 or l1_5, we have to bring it back. But the goal is p2 in l2_8, which is already true. So maybe p2 doesn't need to be moved. Wait, the problem's goal is to have p2 in l2_8, which is already the case. So maybe the plan doesn't need to do anything with p2. But the constraints might require moving p2 temporarily. Let's see.

So constraint 7: if p1 is in l2_5 (which is true initially), then in some state after that (including the initial state), p2 must be in a1 or l1_5. But p2 is in l2_8 initially, so to satisfy this, we need to have p2 moved to a1 or l1_5 at some point. But since the goal requires p2 to stay in l2_8, we have to move it there again. But that complicates things. Hmm. So maybe we have to load p2 into a1, then unload it back to l2_8. But how?

Wait, a1 is in l1_1 (c1's airport). To get p2 from l2_8 (c2) to a1, which is in c1, we'd need to use an airplane. Let's see. So maybe load p2 into t2 (since t2 is in l2_2, but p2 is in l2_8. So first, we need to move t2 to l2_8. Then load p2 into t2. Then drive t2 to l2_1 (airport), then load p2 into a2 (assuming a2 is in l2_1). Then fly a2 to l1_1, unload p2 into a1. Then fly a1 back? Wait, this seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe use a different approach.

Alternatively, maybe use airplane a2 (which is in l2_1) to carry p2. So first, get p2 to l2_1. How? Since p2 is in l2_8 (c2). So use truck t2 (in l2_2) to drive to l2_8, load p2, drive to l2_1, unload, then load into a2, fly to l1_1, unload into a1. But then we have to get p2 back to l2_8. This seems like a lot of steps. But maybe necessary to satisfy the constraint. But the goal requires p2 to be in l2_8, so after moving it, we have to bring it back. That's a problem. Because the user's goal is to have p2 in l2_8. So if we move it, we need to put it back. But the constraints require that after the initial state (where p1 is in l2_5), at some point p2 is in a1 or l1_5. So perhaps the plan must involve moving p2 to a1 or l1_5 and then back.

But l1_5 is in c1. So getting p2 to l1_5 would require moving it from c2 to c1. Which would involve using airplanes. Let's think.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to satisfy the constraint without moving p2. Wait, the constraint is: if p1 is in l2_5 (which is true initially), then in some state after that (including the initial state), p2 is in a1 or l1_5. But in the initial state, p2 is in l2_8, not in a1 or l1_5. So we must have p2 in a1 or l1_5 at some point after the initial state. So even if the initial state has p1 in l2_5, the constraint requires that after that, p2 is moved to a1 or l1_5. But the goal requires p2 to be in l2_8. So the plan must move p2 to a1 or l1_5 and then back to l2_8.

This is a problem. Because the goal requires p2 to be in l2_8. So if we move it away, we have to bring it back. But that's a lot of steps. Let's see.

But maybe there's another way. Let's look at the other constraints. Let's list all constraints again to see if there's a way to combine them.

Constraints:

1. p1 in t2 at some state. Then, in that state or later, p2 in t1 or l2_2.

2. p1 in l2_7 or p2 in t1 at some state.

3. p1 in l2_1 at some state.

4. p2 in l1_3 or p1 in l1_4 at some state.

5. p2 in l2_6 or p1 in l1_6 at some state.

6. p1 in l2_5 (already satisfied initially).

7. If p1 is in l2_5 (as in initial state), then p2 in a1 or l1_5 must hold at or after.

8. p1 in l2_6 at some state.

9. p1 in l2_2 or p2 in l1_3 at some state.

10. p1 in l2_4 at some state.

So these are all the constraints. The goal is p1 in l2_3 and p2 in l2_8.

Now, the main challenge is moving p1 from l2_5 to l2_3 in c2. Since both are in c2, maybe using truck t2 (which is in l2_2). So to get t2 to l2_5, drive through c2's locations. But l2_2 to l2_5: need to check if they are connected. The locations in a city are connected via trucks. So truck t2 can drive from l2_2 to l2_5 via intermediate locations. Wait, the drivetruck action allows moving between any two locations in the same city. So for example, drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_3 c2, then l2_3 to l2_4, etc.

But the constraints require that p1 is in various locations in c2 (l2_1, l2_4, l2_6, l2_7) and also in l1_4 and l1_6. Wait, some constraints require p1 to be in c1's locations. So p1 is in c2 initially, so to get it to c1, we need to use airplanes.

So perhaps the plan involves moving p1 from c2 to c1 via airplane, then moving it around in c1 to satisfy some constraints, then back to c2. But the goal is in c2. But that would complicate the plan. Let's see.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to satisfy all constraints without moving p1 to c1. Let's check.

Constraint 4: p2 in l1_3 (c1) or p1 in l1_4 (c1). So one of these must be true. Since p2 is in c2, to get it to l1_3 would require moving it via airplane. Similarly, p1 is in c2, to get to l1_4 requires airplane. So either way, one of the packages has to be moved between cities.

Similarly, constraint 5: p2 in l2_6 (c2) or p1 in l1_6 (c1). So if we can get p2 to l2_6, that would satisfy this. But p2 is supposed to end up in l2_8. So moving p2 to l2_6 would require moving it back. But perhaps it's possible.

Constraint 9: p1 in l2_2 (c2) or p2 in l1_3 (c1). So again, one of these needs to happen.

So given that some constraints require moving p1 or p2 to c1, the plan must involve inter-city transportation using airplanes.

So the overall plan may look like:

1. Move p1 from l2_5 to some location in c2 where it can be loaded onto an airplane (l2_1, the airport).

2. Fly p1 to c1's airport (l1_1).

3. In c1, move p1 to various locations to satisfy constraints (l1_4, l1_6).

4. Fly p1 back to c2's airport (l2_1).

5. Then move p1 to l2_3.

But also need to handle the other constraints, like p2 must be in t1 or l2_2 when p1 is in t2.

Additionally, the constraints related to p2 must be handled. For example, constraint 7 requires that after the initial state (where p1 is in l2_5), p2 must be in a1 or l1_5. So we need to move p2 to one of those places and then back.

This is getting complicated. Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's handle constraint 7. Since p1 is in l2_5 initially, we need to have p2 in a1 or l1_5 at some state after the initial state. So moving p2 to a1 (which is in l1_1, c1) requires:

- Load p2 into a truck in c2 (t2), drive to airport l2_1, load into airplane a2, fly to l1_1, unload into a1. Then, to get p2 back to l2_8, unload from a1 into a2, fly back to l2_1, unload into t2, drive to l2_8, unload. But this is a lot of steps. Alternatively, maybe load p2 into a2 and fly to l1_1, then unload into a1. But then getting it back would require another flight.

Alternatively, maybe use a different approach. For example, move p2 to l1_5. Since l1_5 is in c1, to get there, p2 needs to be flown to l1_1, then driven via truck t1 (which is in l1_8) to l1_5. Then, drive back to l1_1, fly to l2_1, then drive to l2_8.

But this would require a lot of steps and might interfere with other constraints.

But given that the goal requires p2 to remain in l2_8, which it already is, perhaps the plan must not move p2. But constraint 7 requires that after the initial state, p2 is moved to a1 or l1_5. So we have to move p2, then move it back. Let's see.

So steps for constraint 7:

- Move p2 from l2_8 to a1 (l1_1) or l1_5.

Let's choose a1, as it's an airport. To do this:

1. In c2: drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_8 (drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_8 c2). Then load p2 into t2 (loadtruck p2 t2 l2_8). Then drive t2 to l2_1 (drivetruck t2 l2_8 l2_1 c2). Then load p2 into a2 (loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1). Then fly a2 to l1_1 (flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1). Then unload p2 from a2 into a1 (unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1? Wait, a1 is already in l1_1. Wait, the initial state says "Package a1 is in location l1_1". Wait, wait, the initial state lists "Package a1 is in location l1_1". Wait, but a1 is an airplane, right? Because the objects include "airplane a1". So perhaps that's a typo in the problem statement. Let me check.

Looking back at the problem statement:

The original state includes:

"Package t1 is in location l1_8"

"Package t2 is in location l2_2"

"Package p1 is in location l2_5"

"Package p2 is in location l2_8"

"Package a1 is in location l1_1"

"Package a2 is in location l2_1"

Wait, this seems like a mistake. Because t1 and t2 are trucks, a1 and a2 are airplanes. But the initial state lists them as packages. That can't be right. Because the objects include "truck t1", "truck t2", "airplane a1", "airplane a2". So the problem statement must have a typo. Instead of "Package t1", it should be "Truck t1 is in location l1_8", etc. Similarly for the airplanes. Otherwise, the initial state is inconsistent because trucks and airplanes are not packages.

Assuming that's a typo, the correct initial state should have:

"Truck t1 is in location l1_8"

"Truck t2 is in location l2_2"

"Airplane a1 is in location l1_1"

"Airplane a2 is in location l2_1"

And the packages p1 and p2 are as stated.

Otherwise, the problem is impossible because you can't load a package into a truck that's also a package. So I'll proceed under the assumption that those entries are typos and should refer to trucks and airplanes, not packages.

So correcting the initial state:

- Truck t1 is in l1_8 (c1)

- Truck t2 is in l2_2 (c2)

- Airplane a1 is in l1_1 (c1's airport)

- Airplane a2 is in l2_1 (c2's airport)

- Packages p1 in l2_5 (c2), p2 in l2_8 (c2)

That makes sense. So now, to move p2 to a1 (which is in l1_1, c1), we can do:

1. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_8 (drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_8 c2).

2. Load p2 into t2 (loadtruck p2 t2 l2_8).

3. Drive t2 to l2_1 (airport of c2) (drivetruck t2 l2_8 l2_1 c2).

4. Unload p2 from t2 (unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1).

5. Load p2 into a2 (loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1).

6. Fly a2 to l1_1 (flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1).

7. Unload p2 from a2 (unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1). Now p2 is in l1_1.

But a1 is also in l1_1. Wait, to load p2 into a1, we need to have a1 in l1_1. Since a1 starts there, we can load p2 into a1:

8. Load p2 into a1 (loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1). Now p2 is in a1, satisfying the constraint (p2 in a1).

Then, to return p2 to l2_8:

9. Fly a1 to l2_1 (but a1 is an airplane, can fly between airports. So fly a1 from l1_1 to l2_1 (flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1).

10. Unload p2 from a1 (unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1).

11. Load p2 into a2 (if a2 is back in l2_1? Wait, a2 was flown to l1_1 in step 6. Wait, no: step 6 is fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1. So after step 6, a2 is in l1_1. Then in step 9, a1 is flown to l2_1. So at step 9, a1 is in l2_1, a2 is in l1_1.

To get p2 back to l2_8, after unloading p2 from a1 in l2_1 (step 10), load it into t2 (assuming t2 is in l2_1).

But after step 3, t2 was driven to l2_1. So after step 3, t2 is in l2_1. Then in step 4, we unload p2 into l2_1. Then step 5 loads into a2. So after step 5, p2 is in a2, which is in l2_1 (before flying). Then step 6 flies a2 to l1_1. So after step 6, a2 is in l1_1 with p2. Then step 7 unloads p2 into l1_1, step 8 loads into a1. Step 9 flies a1 to l2_1. So after step 9, a1 is in l2_1 with p2. Step 10 unloads p2 into l2_1. Now, to get p2 back to l2_8:

12. Load p2 into t2 (if t2 is in l2_1). t2 was in l2_1 since step 3. So step 12: loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.

13. Drive t2 to l2_8 (drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_8 c2).

14. Unload p2 (unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_8). Now p2 is back in l2_8, satisfying the goal.

This sequence would handle constraint 7 by having p2 in a1 (step 8). But this is a lot of steps. However, this also affects other constraints. For example, when p1 is in t2 (constraint 1), which may happen during its transport.

But let's see. The main goal is to move p1 to l2_3. Let's try to plan for p1's movement while satisfying all constraints.

First, p1 is in l2_5 (c2). To get to l2_3, which is in c2, we can use truck t2. But t2 is initially in l2_2. So the truck needs to be driven to l2_5 to pick up p1.

But during this process, we need to satisfy constraint 1: p1 must be in t2 at some state. Then, after that, p2 must be in t1 or l2_2.

So if we load p1 into t2, that satisfies constraint 1. Then, in that state or later, p2 must be in t1 (which is in c1) or l2_2 (where t2 started). But p2 is initially in l2_8. So how can p2 be in t1 or l2_2 after p1 is loaded into t2?

Well, perhaps after loading p1 into t2, we can then move p2 to l2_2. But l2_2 is where t2 was initially. But t2 is now in l2_5 (after driving to pick up p1). Wait, no: to load p1 into t2, t2 must be in l2_5. So after loading, we can drive t2 to l2_3 (goal), unload p1. But during this process, the constraint requires that after p1 is in t2, p2 must be in t1 or l2_2 at some state.

But p2 is in l2_8. To get p2 to l2_2, we can drive t2 (after delivering p1) to l2_8, load p2, drive to l2_2, unload. But this would be after the p1 is in t2 state. So this would satisfy the constraint. However, this would require moving p2, which complicates things because the goal is to have p2 in l2_8. So after moving p2 to l2_2, we have to move it back. But that's more steps.

Alternatively, maybe use t1 to move p2. But t1 is in c1 (l1_8). To get t1 to c2, you can't because trucks are city-bound. So t1 can't move to c2. So p2 can't be loaded into t1 unless p2 is in c1. Which requires moving p2 to c1 first.

This is getting too complicated. Let me try to outline a possible plan step by step, considering all constraints.

First, handle constraint 7: after initial state (p1 in l2_5), p2 must be in a1 or l1_5. Let's choose to move p2 to a1.

To do that, as previously outlined:

1. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_8: drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_8 c2.

2. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_8.

3. drivetruck t2 l2_8 l2_1 c2.

4. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.

5. loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1.

6. flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

7. unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1.

8. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1. (Now p2 is in a1, satisfying constraint 7.)

Then, to return p2 to l2_8:

9. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1.

10. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1.

11. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.

12. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_8 c2.

13. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_8. (Now p2 is back.)

Now, this handles constraint 7. But during this process, other constraints must be met.

Next, handle p1's movement. p1 is in l2_5. Need to get it to l2_3. But also need to satisfy constraints that require p1 to be in various places (l2_1, l2_4, l2_6, l2_7, l2_2, l1_4, l1_6).

But some of these are in c1. So to get p1 to c1, need to use an airplane. Let's see.

But the goal is in c2. So perhaps the plan involves moving p1 to c1, satisfy some constraints, then back to c2.

But how?

Alternatively, maybe use the same airplane trip for p1 to satisfy multiple constraints.

For example, when moving p1 via airplane a2 (from c2 to c1), during that trip, p1 could be loaded into a2, flown to c1, then moved around in c1 via t1.

Let's outline:

14. In c2, drive t2 (after returning to l2_8 and unloading p2) to l2_5: drivetruck t2 l2_8 l2_5 c2.

15. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5. (Now p1 is in t2, satisfying constraint 1.)

At this point, constraint 1 is satisfied (p1 in t2). Then, per constraint 1's implication, p2 must be in t1 or l2_2 at or after this state.

But after step 13, p2 is in l2_8. So we need to ensure that after loading p1 into t2, p2 is moved to t1 or l2_2. But t1 is in c1, so p2 would have to be moved to c1 to be in t1, which is complicated. Alternatively, move p2 to l2_2.

But how? p2 is in l2_8. So after step 13, p2 is in l2_8. To move p2 to l2_2:

16. drivetruck t2 l2_8 l2_2 c2.

17. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2.

But this would require t2 to be in l2_8 again. But after step 13, t2 is in l2_8. Then step 14: drive to l2_5. So after step 14, t2 is in l2_5. To move p2 to l2_2, we need to have another truck or use t2 after step 15.

Wait, this is getting messy. Let's try to structure this.

After step 13, t2 is in l2_8. To load p1 into t2, we need t2 to be in l2_5. So step 14: drive t2 from l2_8 to l2_5.

Step 15: load p1 into t2 (now in l2_5). Now, constraint 1 is satisfied (p1 in t2).

At this state, we need to ensure that p2 is in t1 or l2_2 at or after this state.

p2 is in l2_8 (step 13). To get p2 to l2_2, we need to drive t2 (after unloading p1) to l2_8, load p2, drive to l2_2, unload. But this would require:

After step 15, drive t2 (with p1) to l2_3 (goal) and unload. Then drive back to l2_8 to pick up p2. But that's a lot of steps.

Alternatively, perhaps use another truck. But the only trucks are t1 (in c1) and t2 (in c2). So in c2, only t2 is available.

So after step 15, p1 is in t2 at l2_5. To fulfill the implication of constraint 1, we need to have p2 in l2_2 or t1 at some point after.

But how? t1 is in c1. So p2 can only be in t1 if p2 is in c1. Which requires moving p2 to c1, which we already did in steps 1-8, but then moved it back. So maybe during the steps where p2 is in a1 (step 8), that satisfies the implication of constraint 1, because after p1 is loaded into t2 (step 15), we can look back to see if p2 was in a1 (which is in c1) during step 8. But the constraint says that if p1 is in t2 in state s, then in s or after, p2 must be in t1 or l2_2. So if p2 was in a1 before s, that doesn't count. It needs to be in t1 or l2_2 at or after s.

So in this case, after step 15 (p1 in t2), we need to have p2 in t1 or l2_2 at some point after that.

But p2 is in l2_8 after step 13. So perhaps after step 15, we need to move p2 to l2_2.

But how? t2 is in l2_5 with p1. So after unloading p1 at l2_3, drive t2 to l2_8, load p2, drive to l2_2, unload. Then drive back to l2_3 to unload p1. But this requires:

16. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_3 c2 (to deliver p1 to goal).

17. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3. (Now p1 is at goal.)

But then, to move p2:

18. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_8 c2.

19. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_8.

20. drivetruck t2 l2_8 l2_2 c2.

21. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_2.

Now, after step 21, p2 is in l2_2, which satisfies the implication of constraint 1. So between step 15 and step 21, the condition is met.

But this would add several steps. Also, after step 21, p2 is in l2_2, but the goal requires it to be in l2_8. So we need to move it back:

22. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_8 c2.

23. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_8.

But this is getting very long. However, given the constraints, this might be necessary.

Now, let's check other constraints:

- Constraint 3: p1 must be in l2_1. So at some point, p1 needs to be at l2_1 (c2's airport). Which would require moving p1 there via truck.

But in the current plan, p1 is moved from l2_5 to l2_3 directly. So to satisfy constraint 3, perhaps p1 needs to be taken to l2_1.

So modifying the plan to include that:

After step 15 (p1 loaded into t2 at l2_5), drive t2 to l2_1:

16. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2.

17. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1. Now p1 is in l2_1 (satisfying constraint 3).

Then load p1 into a2 (which is in l2_1 after step 6? Wait, no. a2 was flown to l1_1 in step 6 and is still there. So to fly p1 to c1, need to use a different airplane. Or maybe use a2 after it's flown back.

Wait, this is getting too complicated. Let's try to outline the entire plan step by step, considering all constraints.

Alternative approach:

1. Move p1 from l2_5 to l2_3 via truck t2, satisfying the goal.

But need to handle all constraints along the way.

Constraints that involve p1:

- Must be in t2 (constraint 1), which will be done when loading into t2.

- Must be in l2_1 (3), l2_4 (10), l2_6 (8), l2_7 (2), l2_2 (9), l2_4 (10), etc.

Wait, the constraints require p1 to be in multiple places in c2 and some in c1. So perhaps the plan requires moving p1 through various locations in c2 to hit those points.

For example, after loading p1 into t2 (constraint 1), drive through l2_5 → l2_4 → l2_3 (goal). That would hit l2_4, satisfying constraint 10. Then, perhaps after unloading, move p1 again to other locations.

But also, p1 needs to be in l2_1 (airport), which requires driving t2 to l2_1. So maybe:

Steps for p1:

1. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_5: drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2.

2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5 (constraint 1 met).

3. Drive t2 to l2_4: drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2 (p1 in l2_4, constraint 10).

4. Drive t2 to l2_1: drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2 (p1 in l2_1 via truck, constraint 3).

5. Unload p1: unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1.

6. Load p1 into a2: loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1.

7. Fly a2 to l1_1: flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

8. Unload p1 from a2: unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1.

Now, p1 is in l1_1 (c1). Then, to satisfy constraints that require p1 in l1_4 or l1_6:

9. Drive t1 (in l1_8) to l1_1: drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_1 c1.

10. Load p1 into t1: loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1.

11. Drive t1 to l1_4: drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1 (p1 in l1_4, constraint 4).

12. Drive t1 to l1_6: drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_6 c1 (p1 in l1_6, constraint 5).

13. Unload p1: unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_6.

14. Load p1 into a1: loadairplane p1 a1 l1_6. Wait, no. a1 is in l1_1. So need to drive t1 to l1_1 again.

Wait, after step 9, t1 is in l1_1. Step 10: load p1 into t1 there. Then drive to l1_4, l1_6. To get p1 back to an airport, need to drive to l1_1:

15. drivetruck t1 l1_6 l1_1 c1.

16. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1.

17. loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1.

18. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1.

19. unloadairplane p1 a1 l2_1.

20. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_1.

21. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2.

22. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (goal).

This way, p1 visits l2_4, l2_1, l1_4, l1_6, satisfying constraints 3,4,5,10, etc. But this is a very long plan. Also, need to handle the other constraints.

Meanwhile, handling p2's constraints:

As per constraint 7, need to have p2 in a1 or l1_5 after initial state. So during the plan, p2 is moved to a1 (step 8 in the earlier outline). Also, constraint 2 requires p1 in l2_7 or p2 in t1. Since p1 is never in l2_7 in this plan, we need p2 to be in t1 at some point. t1 is in c1, so p2 must be loaded into t1. Which would require moving p2 to c1 and into t1. This could happen when p2 is in a1 (l1_1), then unloaded and loaded into t1.

So steps for p2:

After step 8 (p2 in a1):

9. unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1.

10. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (but t1 is in l1_8 at the start. Need to drive t1 to l1_1).

So insert steps to move t1 to l1_1:

11. drivetruck t1 l1_8 l1_1 c1.

12. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1. Now p2 is in t1, satisfying constraint 2 (p2 in t1).

But then, to return p2 to l2_8:

13. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

14. loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1.

15. flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1.

16. unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1.

17. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.

18. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_8 c2.

19. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_8.

This satisfies the goal for p2.

Now, putting all together, the plan would have numerous steps. But we need to ensure all constraints are met.

But this is getting too long and complicated. Given the time constraints, perhaps the optimal plan is to find a way to satisfy all constraints with minimal steps. Let's try to find a smarter path.

Alternative Idea:

Use the fact that some constraints can be satisfied during the transportation of p1.

For example:

- Constraint 1: p1 in t2. This happens when we load p1 into t2.

- Then, constraint 1's implication requires p2 in t1 or l2_2. To satisfy this, after loading p1 into t2, move p2 to l2_2.

But p2 is in l2_8. So after loading p1 into t2, drive t2 to l2_8, load p2, drive to l2_2, unload. Then drive back to deliver p1.

But this would require:

1. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_5.

2. Load p1 into t2 (constraint 1 met).

3. Drive t2 to l2_8.

4. Load p2 into t2.

5. Drive t2 to l2_2, unload p2 (now p2 is in l2_2, satisfying constraint 1's implication).

6. Drive t2 to l2_3, unload p1 (goal).

But this would leave p2 in l2_2, but the goal requires p2 in l2_8. So we need to move p2 back:

7. Drive t2 to l2_2, load p2.

8. Drive to l2_8, unload.

But this adds steps. However, this sequence would satisfy several constraints:

- p1 in t2 (step 2).

- p2 in l2_2 (step 5), satisfying constraint 1's implication.

- p2 in l2_2 also contributes to constraint 9 (p1 in l2_2 or p2 in l1_3). So one of those must be true. If p2 is in l2_2, then constraint 9 is satisfied.

Also, constraint 7 requires p2 in a1 or l1_5. Since in this plan, p2 is moved to l2_2 and back, but not to a1 or l1_5, this constraint is not satisfied. So this approach won't work.

So, we have to include steps to move p2 to a1 or l1_5.

Another Idea:

Use the movement of p1 through various locations in c2 to satisfy multiple constraints. For example:

- Load p1 into t2 (constraint 1).

- Drive t2 through l2_5 → l2_4 → l2_3 → l2_2 → l2_1 → etc., unloading and loading as needed.

But each time you unload p1, you can satisfy some constraints.

But this needs careful planning.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal plan involves flying p1 to c1 and back, hitting multiple constraints, but this may not be optimal.

Given the time I've spent and the complexity, I'll try to outline a possible plan that meets all constraints:

1. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_5.

2. Load p1 into t2 (now p1 in t2, constraint 1 met).

3. Drive t2 to l2_4 (p1 in l2_4 when unloaded, constraint 10).

4. Unload p1 in l2_4.

5. Load p1 again into t2.

6. Drive t2 to l2_1.

7. Unload p1 in l2_1 (constraint 3).

8. Load p1 into a2.

9. Fly a2 to l1_1.

10. Unload p1 in l1_1.

11. Load p1 into a1.

12. Fly a1 to l1_6.

13. Unload p1 in l1_6 (constraint 5).

14. Load p1 into t1.

15. Drive t1 to l1_4 (p1 in l1_4, constraint 4).

16. Unload p1 in l1_4.

17. Load p1 into t1 again.

18. Drive t1 to l1_1.

19. Load p1 into a1.

20. Fly a1 to l2_1.

21. Unload p1 in l2_1.

22. Load p1 into t2.

23. Drive t2 to l2_3 and unload (goal).

Meanwhile, for p2:

24. Drive t2 (after step 23) to l2_8.

25. Load p2.

26. Drive to l2_1, load into a2.

27. Fly a2 to l1_1, unload into a1 (constraint 7).

28. Fly a1 to l2_1, unload p2.

29. Load into t2, drive to l2_8, unload.

This is a very rough outline and may have errors, but it's an attempt to hit all constraints.

However, given time constraints and the complexity, I think the optimal plan will involve moving p1 through various locations in c2 and c1 to meet the constraints, and moving p2 to a1 temporarily.

After multiple iterations and checking constraints, the final plan would have to include steps that ensure each constraint is met at least once, and all implications are satisfied.
