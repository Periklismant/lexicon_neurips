Let me analyze this problem:

First, let's identify the initial state:
- Location l1_1 is an airport in city c1
- Location l1_2 through l1_8 are locations in city c1
- Location l2_1 is an airport in city c2
- Location l2_2 through l2_8 are locations in city c2
- t1 is in location l1_8 (city c1)
- t2 is in location l2_2 (city c2)
- p1 is in location l2_5 (city c2)
- p2 is in location l2_8 (city c2)
- a1 is in location l1_1 (airport in city c1)
- a2 is in location l2_1 (airport in city c2)

Wait, there's an issue here. The problem statement says "Package t1 is in location l1_8", "Package t2 is in location l2_2", "Package a1 is in location l1_1", "Package a2 is in location l2_1". But t1 and t2 should be trucks, and a1 and a2 should be airplanes, not packages. I'll assume these are typos, and they should be:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_8 (city c1)
- Truck t2 is in location l2_2 (city c2)
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (airport in city c1)
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1 (airport in city c2)
- Package p1 is in location l2_5 (city c2)
- Package p2 is in location l2_8 (city c2)

The goal is:
- Package p1 is in location l2_3
- Package p2 is in location l2_8 (which is already true in the initial state)

Let's plan:

For p1:
It's currently in l2_5 and needs to be moved to l2_3. Both locations are in city c2. We can use truck t2 which is in l2_2. The plan would be:
1. Drive truck t2 from l2_2 to l2_5
2. Load package p1 in truck t2 at l2_5
3. Drive truck t2 from l2_5 to l2_3
4. Unload package p1 from truck t2 at l2_3

For p2:
It's already in the goal location l2_8, so we don't need to move it.

Let's formalize the plan:

```
drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_3 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
```

This plan should achieve the goal of having p1 in l2_3 and p2 in l2_8. Let's verify:

Initial state:
- p1 is in l2_5
- p2 is in l2_8
- t2 is in l2_2

After drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2:
- p1 is in l2_5
- p2 is in l2_8
- t2 is in l2_5

After loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5:
- p1 is in t2
- p2 is in l2_8
- t2 is in l2_5

After drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_3 c2:
- p1 is in t2
- p2 is in l2_8
- t2 is in l2_3

After unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3:
- p1 is in l2_3
- p2 is in l2_8
- t2 is in l2_3

Final state:
- p1 is in l2_3
- p2 is in l2_8

This matches the goal state, so the plan is valid.

Checking for optimality, this plan is optimal for these reasons:
1. p2 is already in the goal location, so no action is needed for it.
2. For p1, we need a minimum of 4 actions: drive the truck to the package, load the package, drive the truck to the goal location, and unload the package.

So the optimal plan is:
```
drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_3 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
```

Wait, let me check the problem statement again. The original state says:
"Package t1 is in location l1_8"
"Package t2 is in location l2_2"
"Package p1 is in location l2_5"
"Package p2 is in location l2_8"
"Package a1 is in location l1_1"
"Package a2 is in location l2_1"

This is confusing because t1, t2, a1, and a2 are not packages. Let me re-read the problem statement to ensure I'm understanding correctly.

Reading the problem statement again, it looks like there's a mistake in the problem statement. t1 and t2 are trucks, and a1 and a2 are airplanes, not packages. So I'll re-interpret the original state:
- Truck t1 is in location l1_8 (city c1)
- Truck t2 is in location l2_2 (city c2)
- Package p1 is in location l2_5 (city c2)
- Package p2 is in location l2_8 (city c2)
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (airport in city c1)
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1 (airport in city c2)

Given this interpretation, my previous plan is still valid:
```
drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_3 c2
unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
```
