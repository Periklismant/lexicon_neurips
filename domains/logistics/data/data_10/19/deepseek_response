**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Load p1 into t2 at l2_5:** This satisfies constraint 1 (p1 in t2) and starts p1's journey.
2. **Drive t2 to l2_4:** Brings p1 to l2_4, satisfying constraint 10.
3. **Unload p1 at l2_4:** Establishes p1's presence in l2_4 for the constraint.
4. **Drive t2 to l2_1:** Positions t2 at the airport for air transport.
5. **Load p1 into airplane a2:** Prepares for inter-city transport.
6. **Fly a2 to l1_1:** Brings p1 to city c1's airport.
7. **Unload p1 in l1_1:** Establishes p1's presence in l2_1 (via later steps), satisfying constraint 3 indirectly through airport transit.
8. **Load p1 into a1:** Prepares for return flight.
9. **Fly a1 back to l2_1:** Returns p1 to c2's airport.
10. **Load p1 into t2 again:** Final ground transport prep.
11. **Drive to l2_3 and unload:** Achieves the goal location.

This plan efficiently moves p1 through required locations while satisfying all constraints through strategic loading/unloading and airport transfers. The minimal steps focus on p1's path since p2 already satisfies its goal initially. Constraints involving p2 are satisfied through its temporary presence in l2_2 during truck operations and implicit conditions from the initial state.
