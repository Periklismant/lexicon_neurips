I'll start by analyzing the problem statement and then devise a plan to move packages p1 and p2 to their goal locations.

First, let me clarify what I understand from the problem:

1. We have two cities: c1 and c2.
2. Each city has multiple locations, including an airport (l1_1 in c1 and l2_1 in c2).
3. We have two packages: p1 and p2.
4. We have two trucks: t1 and t2.
5. We have two airplanes: a1 and a2.

The initial state:
- Locations l1_1, l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5 are in city c1.
- Locations l2_1, l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5 are in city c2.
- Package p1 is in location l2_2 (in city c2).
- Package p2 is in location l1_4 (in city c1).
- Truck t1 is in location l1_4 (in city c1).
- Truck t2 is in location l2_5 (in city c2).
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1 (airport in city c1).
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1 (airport in city c2).

The goal:
- Package p1 should be in location l2_5 (in city c2).
- Package p2 should be in location l1_3 (in city c1).

Now, let's devise a plan:

For p1 (currently in l2_2, goal is l2_5):
- Since p1 is in city c2 and its goal is also in city c2, we can move it using a truck. Truck t2 is in l2_5, so we need to:
  1. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2
  2. Load p1 onto t2
  3. Drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_5
  4. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_5

For p2 (currently in l1_4, goal is l1_3):
- Since p2 is in city c1 and its goal is also in city c1, we can move it using a truck. Truck t1 is in l1_4, so we need to:
  1. Load p2 onto t1 at l1_4
  2. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_3
  3. Unload p2 from t1 at l1_3

Let me list the actions in the plan:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
5. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
6. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1
7. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

Hmm, there's something strange in the problem description. It says:

"Package t1 is in location l1_4"
"Package t2 is in location l2_5"
"Package p1 is in location l2_2"
"Package p2 is in location l1_4"
"Package a1 is in location l1_1"
"Package a2 is in location l2_1"

But t1, t2, a1, and a2 are not packages; they are a truck and an airplane, respectively. Let's interpret this as:

"Truck t1 is in location l1_4"
"Truck t2 is in location l2_5"
"Package p1 is in location l2_2"
"Package p2 is in location l1_4"
"Airplane a1 is in location l1_1"
"Airplane a2 is in location l2_1"

This makes more sense. Now, let's proceed with the plan I outlined above.

For p1 (currently in l2_2, goal is l2_5):
1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5

For p2 (currently in l1_4, goal is l1_3):
5. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
6. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1
7. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

This plan should achieve the goal.

Wait, I notice an inconsistency. The actions list "loadairplane" twice, but one of them should be "unloadairplane" based on the descriptions provided. The corrected actions are:

- "loadtruck p t l": Load package p in truck t. Both p and t are in location l.
- "loadairplane p ap l": Load package p in airplane ap. Both p and ap are in location l.
- "unloadtruck p t l": Unload package p from truck t in location l.
- "unloadairplane p ap l": Unload package p from airplane ap in location l.
- "drivetruck t l_from l_to c": Drive truck t from location l_from to location l_to in city c.
- "flyairplane ap l_from l_to": Fly airplane ap from location l_from to location l_to.

I'll correct my plan based on these actions, but since we're not using airplanes in the plan (both packages stay within their respective cities), the correction doesn't affect my plan.

Let me double-check:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2: Drive truck t2 from l2_5 to l2_2 in city c2.
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2: Load package p1 into truck t2 at location l2_2.
3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2: Drive truck t2 from l2_2 to l2_5 in city c2.
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5: Unload package p1 from truck t2 at location l2_5.
5. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4: Load package p2 into truck t1 at location l1_4.
6. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1: Drive truck t1 from l1_4 to l1_3 in city c1.
7. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3: Unload package p2 from truck t1 at location l1_3.

This plan achieves the goal of moving p1 to l2_5 and p2 to l1_3.

Actually, there's another issue. In the problem statement, it says:

```
"unloadairplane": You may only unload package p from a airplane ap in a location l if (i) ap is situated in l, and (ii) p is in ap.
"flyairplane": You may only fly an airplane ap from location l_from to location l_to if ap is situated in l_from.
```

But just before that, the "loadairplane" action is listed twice:

```
"loadtruck p t l": Load package p in truck t. Both p and t are in location l.
"loadairplane p ap l": Load package p in airplane ap. Both p and ap are in location l.
"unloadtruck p t l": Unload package p from truck t in location l.
"loadairplane p ap l": Unload package p from airplane ap in location l.
```

The second "loadairplane" should be "unloadairplane". I'm going to assume that's the case and continue with my plan.

The plan I've outlined should be correct:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
5. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
6. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1
7. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3

Let's check if this is an optimal plan. 

For p1 to get from l2_2 to l2_5, it needs to be loaded onto a vehicle, transported, and then unloaded. Truck t2 is already in l2_5, so it needs to go to l2_2 first, which adds one extra step. So, the optimal path for p1 is 4 steps: drive truck to p1, load p1, drive back to goal, unload p1.

For p2 to get from l1_4 to l1_3, it also needs to be loaded, transported, and unloaded. Truck t1 is already at l1_4 with p2, so it doesn't need to be driven to the location of p2 first. So, the optimal path for p2 is 3 steps: load p2, drive to goal, unload p2.

Combined, the optimal plan is 7 steps, which matches the plan I've outlined. Therefore, the plan is optimal.

Let me check one more time if the plan is valid according to the preconditions and effects of the actions:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
   - Precondition: t2 is in l2_5, and both l2_5 and l2_2 are in city c2. This is true from the initial state.
   - Effect: t2 is now in l2_2 and no longer in l2_5.

2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
   - Precondition: p1 and t2 are both in l2_2. After the previous action, t2 is in l2_2, and from the initial state, p1 is in l2_2. So, this is valid.
   - Effect: p1 is now in t2 and no longer in l2_2.

3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
   - Precondition: t2 is in l2_2, and both l2_2 and l2_5 are in city c2. After the two previous actions, t2 is in l2_2, so this is valid.
   - Effect: t2 is now in l2_5 and no longer in l2_2.

4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
   - Precondition: t2 is in l2_5, and p1 is in t2. After the three previous actions, both of these are true. So, this is valid.
   - Effect: p1 is now in l2_5 and no longer in t2.

5. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
   - Precondition: p2 and t1 are both in l1_4. From the initial state, both p2 and t1 are in l1_4. So, this is valid.
   - Effect: p2 is now in t1 and no longer in l1_4.

6. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1
   - Precondition: t1 is in l1_4, and both l1_4 and l1_3 are in city c1. After the previous action, t1 is still in l1_4, and from the initial state, both locations are in city c1. So, this is valid.
   - Effect: t1 is now in l1_3 and no longer in l1_4.

7. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
   - Precondition: t1 is in l1_3, and p2 is in t1. After the six previous actions, both of these are true. So, this is valid.
   - Effect: p2 is now in l1_3 and no longer in t1.

The plan is valid and optimal. After executing this plan, p1 will be in l2_5 and p2 will be in l1_3, which is the goal state.

OK, so this is the final plan:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_2
3. drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_5 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_5
5. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_4
6. drivetruck t1 l1_4 l1_3 c1
7. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_3
