Alright, I need to solve a logistics planning problem. Let's break down what I need to do:

1. Understand the current state of the world.
2. Identify the goal state.
3. Determine the actions needed to reach the goal state, considering the constraints.

First, let's look at the current state of the world:

- Locations in city c1: l1_1 (airport), l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5
- Locations in city c2: l2_1 (airport), l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5
- t1 is in location l1_4
- t2 is in location l2_1
- p1 is in location l2_3
- p2 is in location l2_5
- a1 is in location l1_1
- a2 is in location l2_1

The goal state is:
- p1 is in location l2_4
- p2 is in location l2_1

I notice that there's an inconsistency in the problem description. It refers to objects "t1", "t2", "a1", "a2" as packages, but they are also defined as trucks and airplanes. I'll assume that the lines should read:

- Truck t1 is in location l1_4
- Truck t2 is in location l2_1
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1
- Package p1 is in location l2_3
- Package p2 is in location l2_5

This makes more sense in the context of the problem. 

Now, let's plan how to achieve the goal state:

For package p1:
- Current location: l2_3
- Goal location: l2_4
- Both locations are in city c2, so I can use a truck to move p1 from l2_3 to l2_4.

For package p2:
- Current location: l2_5
- Goal location: l2_1
- Both locations are in city c2, so I can use a truck to move p2 from l2_5 to l2_1.

Let's plan the sequence of actions:

For package p1:
1. I need a truck in location l2_3 to pick up p1.
2. Truck t2 is in location l2_1, so I need to drive it to l2_3.
3. Load p1 onto truck t2.
4. Drive truck t2 from l2_3 to l2_4.
5. Unload p1 from truck t2 at location l2_4.

For package p2:
1. I need a truck in location l2_5 to pick up p2.
2. After dropping off p1 at l2_4, I can drive truck t2 to l2_5.
3. Load p2 onto truck t2.
4. Drive truck t2 from l2_5 to l2_1.
5. Unload p2 from truck t2 at location l2_1.

Now, let's write the plan:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2 (Drive truck t2 from airport to l2_3 to pick up p1)
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3 (Load package p1 onto truck t2 at l2_3)
3. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2 (Drive truck t2 from l2_3 to l2_4)
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4 (Unload package p1 from truck t2 at l2_4)
5. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2 (Drive truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_5 to pick up p2)
6. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5 (Load package p2 onto truck t2 at l2_5)
7. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2 (Drive truck t2 from l2_5 to l2_1)
8. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1 (Unload package p2 from truck t2 at l2_1)

Now, let's verify that this plan satisfies the goals:

Goal 1: Package p1 is in location l2_4.
- After step 4, p1 is unloaded at l2_4, which achieves this goal.

Goal 2: Package p2 is in location l2_1.
- After step 8, p2 is unloaded at l2_1, which achieves this goal.

The plan seems valid. Let's now check if there's a more optimal plan.

I notice that I never used truck t1 or the airplanes, but that's okay since I didn't need them to achieve the goals.

Is there a more optimal plan for p1? Let's check:

For p1, I needed to:
1. Drive truck t2 from l2_1 to l2_3
2. Load p1 onto t2
3. Drive t2 from l2_3 to l2_4
4. Unload p1 from t2 at l2_4

This seems optimal since I'm just moving the truck directly to pick up the package and then directly to drop it off.

For p2, I needed to:
1. Drive truck t2 from l2_4 to l2_5
2. Load p2 onto t2
3. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_1
4. Unload p2 from t2 at l2_1

This also seems optimal for the same reason.

Is there a more optimal plan for p2 if I use truck t1 instead? Let's check:

1. Drive truck t1 from l1_4 to l1_1 (airport in city c1)
2. Fly airplane a1 or a2 from l1_1 to l2_1 (airport in city c2)
3. Drive truck t1 from l2_1 to l2_5
4. Load p2 onto t1
5. Drive t1 from l2_5 to l2_1
6. Unload p2 from t1 at l2_1

This plan would require at least 6 steps, which is more than the 4 steps needed if I continue using truck t2 after delivering p1. So, the original plan is more optimal.

Having thought through the problem, I believe my original plan is optimal, requiring 8 steps to achieve both goals.

Actually let me double check the preconditions and effects of the actions again.

For "loadtruck": You may only load package p in a truck t if p and t are in the same location l.
This is satisfied in my plan because I drive the truck to the package's location before loading it.

For "unloadtruck": You may only unload package p from a truck t in a location l if (i) t is situated in l, and (ii) p is in t.
This is satisfied in my plan because I first load the package onto the truck and then drive to the destination before unloading.

For "drivetruck": You may only move a truck t from location l_from to location l_to in a city c if (i) t is situated in l_from, and (ii) l_from and l_to are locations of c.
This is satisfied in my plan because I move the truck between locations within the same city.

The effects of each action in my plan also align with the expected outcomes.

So, my plan is valid and, as far as I can determine, optimal.

The optimal plan is:

1. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2
2. loadtruck p1 t2 l2_3
3. drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_4 c2
4. unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4
5. drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_5 c2
6. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_5
7. drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_1 c2
8. unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1

Hmm, as I reread the problem, I'm confused about the descriptions of t1, t2, a1, a2:

- "Package t1 is in location l1_4"
- "Package t2 is in location l2_1"
- "Package a1 is in location l1_1"
- "Package a2 is in location l2_1"

But t1, t2 are defined as trucks and a1, a2 are defined as airplanes. I think this might be a typo or error in the problem description. I'm going to assume that what is meant is:

- "Truck t1 is in location l1_4"
- "Truck t2 is in location l2_1"
- "Airplane a1 is in location l1_1"
- "Airplane a2 is in location l2_1"

If this is correct, then my plan is valid. 

However, if t1, t2, a1, a2 are actually packages, then I'd need a completely different approach. But this doesn't align with the object definitions in the problem. Let's assume the corrected version and proceed with the plan I've outlined.
