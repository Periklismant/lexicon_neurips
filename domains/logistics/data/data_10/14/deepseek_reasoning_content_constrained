Okay, let's tackle this planning problem. Hmm, the goal is to get p1 to l1_1 and p2 to l1_4. There are a bunch of constraints too. Let me start by understanding the initial state.

First, the objects:

- Locations in c1: l1_1 (airport), l1_2, l1_3, l1_4, l1_5.
- Locations in c2: l2_1 (airport), l2_2, l2_3, l2_4, l2_5.
- Trucks: t1 in l1_5, t2 in l2_5.
- Airplanes: a1 in l1_1, a2 in l2_1.
- Packages: p1 is in l2_5, p2 in l2_2. Also, packages t1 and t2 are mentioned, but I think that's a typo. Wait, the original state says "Package t1 is in location l1_5" but t1 is a truck. Maybe that's a mistake. Oh wait, maybe the user meant "Truck t1 is in location l1_5". Because it's impossible for a package to be named t1 if there's a truck named t1. Probably a typo. So assuming that the original state has Truck t1 in l1_5, Truck t2 in l2_5. Similarly, "Package a1 is in location l1_1" but a1 is an airplane. So that must be a typo too. So correcting that: Airplane a1 is in l1_1, a2 in l2_1. The actual packages are p1 and p2. So initial state:

- p1 is in l2_5 (city c2)
- p2 is in l2_2 (city c2)
- Trucks t1 in l1_5 (c1), t2 in l2_5 (c2)
- Airplanes a1 in l1_1 (c1's airport), a2 in l2_1 (c2's airport)

So the goal is p1 in l1_1 (c1's airport) and p2 in l1_4 (c1's city). Since p1 is in c2, we need to move it to c1. The only way to move between cities is by airplane. So p1 needs to be loaded onto an airplane in c2's airport (l2_1) and flown to c1's airport (l1_1). Then unloaded. But wait, p1 is in l2_5 (c2's city). So first, we need to move p1 from l2_5 to l2_1 (the airport) using truck t2, which is already in l2_5. So load p1 into t2 at l2_5, drive t2 to l2_1, unload p1, then load onto airplane a2 (since a2 is in l2_1?), then fly a2 to l1_1. Wait, but a1 is in l1_1. Wait, the airplanes are a1 in l1_1 and a2 in l2_1. So to get p1 from l2_1 (after truck transport) into an airplane, we need to load it onto a2, then fly a2 to l1_1. Then unload p1 there.

For p2, which is in l2_2 (c2), need to get it to l1_4 (c1). So similar approach: transport to c2's airport, fly to c1's airport, then use truck in c1 to move to l1_4. But how? Let's think step by step.

But wait, the constraints complicate things. Let's list all constraints to make sure we satisfy them.

Constraints:

1. p2 in l2_2 must hold in at least one state. Well, initially p2 is in l2_2, so that's already satisfied. So maybe that's automatically okay.

2. If p2 is in l2_2 in some state s, then in s or later, either p2 is in l2_4 or p1 in l1_5. Since p2 starts in l2_2, we need to ensure that after that, either p2 goes to l2_4 or p1 ends up in l1_5. But the goal doesn't require p1 to be in l1_5. Wait, but the initial state has t1 (truck) in l1_5, and p1 is in l2_5. So maybe during the plan, p1 is moved to l1_5, but that's not part of the goal. So perhaps we need to arrange for p1 to be in l1_5 at some point. But how?

Wait, the goal is p1 in l1_1. So if we have to have p1 in l1_5 at some point, that would require moving it there, but then moving it again. Let's see. But maybe that's not necessary. Let's check.

But the second constraint says that whenever p2 is in l2_2 (which is initially true), then in that state or later, either p2 is in l2_4 or p1 is in l1_5. Since the initial state has p2 in l2_2, this constraint applies. So after the initial state, we must have either p2 in l2_4 or p1 in l1_5 at some point. But the goal doesn't require p1 to be in l1_5, so perhaps the plan must include moving p1 to l1_5 at some point, or moving p2 to l2_4. Let's see.

But moving p2 to l2_4 (which is in c2) could be part of transporting it towards the airport. For example, moving p2 from l2_2 to l2_4 via truck t2 (if t2 is in l2_5, then drive to l2_2, load p2, drive to l2_4, unload. Then from l2_4, maybe take to airport l2_1. But l2_4 is in c2, so moving within c2.

But how does that affect the constraints? If we move p2 to l2_4, then that satisfies the second constraint. So perhaps that's a way to handle it.

Third constraint: p2 must be in l1_1 at some state. The goal is p2 in l1_4, so maybe during transport, p2 is in l1_1 (the airport of c1). But how? Because to get p2 from c2 to c1, we need to fly it. So p2 would be in l2_1 (c2's airport), loaded onto a2, flown to l1_1 (c1's airport), then unloaded. So p2 would be in l1_1 at that point. So that satisfies the third constraint.

Fourth constraint: if p2 is in l1_1 in state s, then in s or later, either p2 is in l2_3 or p1 is in l2_4. Since the goal is p2 in l1_4 (c1), but this constraint requires that after p2 is in l1_1, either p2 goes to l2_3 (c2) or p1 is in l2_4 (c2). Wait, but how? Because p2 is already in c1. If we have to send p2 back to c2's l2_3, that complicates things, or p1 has to be in l2_4. But the goal requires p1 to be in l1_1, so p1 can't be in l2_4. So this seems conflicting. Wait, but perhaps during the plan, p1 is moved to l2_4 and then moved again. Let's see.

Alternatively, maybe we can structure the plan such that after p2 is in l1_1, we have p1 in l2_4 at some point. But how? p1 starts in l2_5 (c2), so maybe we can move p1 from l2_5 to l2_4 using truck t2. But why would we do that? The goal is to get p1 to l1_1. So maybe if we first move p1 to l2_4, then to l2_1, then fly. But that adds steps. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps after unloading p2 at l1_1 (satisfying constraint 3), then in a later state, p1 is in l2_4. But how? Since p1 needs to get to l1_1, maybe after p1 is flown to l1_1, but then the constraint is that if p2 is in l1_1 (which is part of the plan), then after that, either p2 is in l2_3 or p1 is in l2_4. But if p1 is already in l1_1 (the goal), how can it be in l2_4? That's impossible unless we move it back, which would not make sense. So perhaps this constraint requires that after p2 is in l1_1, we have to have p2 move to l2_3. But that would require moving p2 back to c2, which complicates things. This seems tricky.

Wait, the fourth constraint says: if p2 is in l1_1 in state s, then in s or after, either p2 is in l2_3 or p1 is in l2_4. So perhaps after unloading p2 at l1_1 (which is required for the third constraint), we have to then move p2 to l2_3 (which is in c2) or move p1 to l2_4 (also in c2). But the goal is for p1 to be in l1_1 and p2 in l1_4, so moving p2 back to c2 would require another trip. This complicates the plan. Hmm, maybe this is a problem. Let's see.

Alternatively, maybe we can arrange for p1 to be in l2_4 before p2 is moved to l1_1. But how? Because p1 starts in l2_5. So maybe during the plan, after moving p1 to l2_4 (using truck t2), then proceed to move it to the airport. Let me think. So steps for p1: l2_5 (initial) -> load into t2, drive to l2_4, unload (so p1 is in l2_4, satisfying the fourth constraint's alternative). Then load again into t2, drive to l2_1, unload, load into a2, fly to l1_1. Then, when p2 is in l1_1 (after being flown there), the fourth constraint's condition is met because in a previous state, p1 was in l2_4. Wait, but the constraint says that if p2 is in l1_1 in state s, then in s or after, p1 is in l2_4 or p2 is in l2_3. So if p1 was in l2_4 before s, then the "after s" part isn't satisfied. The constraint requires that in s or after, the condition holds. So if p1 was in l2_4 before s, but not in s or after, then it doesn't satisfy. So maybe we need p1 to be in l2_4 either at the same time as p2 is in l1_1 or after. But once p1 is in l1_1 (goal), it can't be in l2_4 anymore. So this seems difficult. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the constraints. Let's recheck the fourth constraint:

"If expression 'Package p2 is in location l1_1' holds in some state s, then expression 'At least one of the following conditions is true: "Package p2 is in location l2_3", "Package p1 is in location l2_4"' must hold at s or at some state after s."

So when p2 is in l1_1 (state s), then in that same state s or any state after, either p2 is in l2_3 or p1 is in l2_4. So for example, if in state s (when p2 is in l1_1), we have p1 in l2_4, then it's okay. Or after s, p2 is moved to l2_3. But how can we do that? Because the goal is p2 in l1_4. So maybe after moving p2 to l1_1 (airport), we have to move it again to l2_3, but that's in c2, which would require flying back. That's a problem because the goal requires p2 to end up in l1_4. Alternatively, perhaps before moving p2 to l1_1, we have p1 in l2_4. Then, when p2 is in l1_1 (s), p1 is already in l2_4 (from a previous step), so the condition holds in s. That would satisfy the constraint. So maybe that's the way.

So the plan for p1 would involve moving it from l2_5 to l2_4 (using truck t2), then to l2_1 (airport), then load onto a2, fly to l1_1. Then p1 is in l1_1. But during this, when p2 is in l1_1 (after being flown there), p1 is already in l1_1 (goal), but we need to have p1 in l2_4 at some point. Wait, but if p1 was in l2_4 before being moved to the airport, then when p2 is in l1_1, the state after that, p1 is in l1_1, not l2_4. So the condition would not hold. Hmm, maybe this approach won't work.

Alternatively, maybe after moving p2 to l1_1, we need to move p2 to l2_3. But that would require flying back, which complicates the plan. Let's think:

- Fly p2 to l1_1 (so p2 is in l1_1, satisfying constraint 3).
- Then, fly p2 back to l2_3's airport? Wait, l2_3 is a city c2 location, but the airports are l2_1. So l2_3 is a regular location. To get p2 to l2_3, you'd need to fly to l2_1 (airport), then use a truck to drive to l2_3. But that's adding steps. Then from l2_3, how to get p2 back to c1's l1_4? This seems too long. Not optimal.

This is getting complicated. Let's see other constraints.

Fifth constraint: p2 must be in l2_4 at some state. So the plan must include p2 in l2_4. How? Maybe when moving p2 from l2_2 to l2_1 (airport), we can go via l2_4. For example, drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2, load p2, drive to l2_4, then to l2_1. That way, p2 is in l2_4, satisfying constraint 5.

Sixth constraint: p2 must be in l1_3 or in a1 at some state. So perhaps during transportation, p2 is loaded into a1. But a1 is in c1's airport l1_1. So unless a1 is flown to c2, which is possible. Wait, airplanes can fly between airports. So a1 is in l1_1. To get p2 into a1, we need to fly a1 to l2_1 (c2's airport), load p2 into a1, then fly back. But that might be a way to satisfy the sixth constraint.

But that's adding more steps. Alternatively, after p2 is in l1_1 (airport), we load it into a1 (which is already there), then unload it again. That would make p2 in a1 during that step. So that could satisfy the sixth constraint.

Seventh constraint: both p1 and p2 are in a1 at some state. So during the plan, both packages must be loaded into a1. For example, after flying p2 to l1_1, load both into a1. But how? Maybe after p1 is in l1_1 (goal), and p2 is in l1_1, load them both into a1, then unload p2 into a truck to take to l1_4.

Eighth constraint: p2 must be in l2_1 at some state. Well, when moving p2 from l2_2 to the airport l2_1, that's covered. So that's already part of the plan.

Ninth constraint: if p2 is in l2_1 in some state, then there must be an earlier state where p1 is in l2_4 or p2 is in l2_5. p2 starts in l2_2, and l2_5 is where t2 is. So when moving p2 to l2_1, the earlier state could have p2 in l2_5 (but initially, p2 is in l2_2). So to satisfy this, perhaps we need to move p2 to l2_5 first. But why? Alternatively, maybe during the plan, p1 is moved to l2_4, which would satisfy the "p1 is in l2_4" part. So if p2 is in l2_1 (airport), then before that, p1 was in l2_4. So during the plan, after moving p1 to l2_4, then p2 is moved to l2_1. That would satisfy the ninth constraint.

Tenth constraint: p1 in t1 and p2 in l1_2 at some state. So p1 must be loaded into truck t1 (which is in c1's locations), and p2 must be in l1_2. But p1 starts in c2. To get p1 into t1, which is in c1, we need to first get p1 to c1. So after flying p1 to l1_1 (c1's airport), load it into a truck (maybe t1) and drive to l1_2. Then unload p1 into t1 (but wait, t1 is a truck; loading p1 into t1 would require them to be in the same location). So perhaps after p1 is in l1_1, load into t1 (but t1 is in l1_5 initially). So need to drive t1 to l1_1? But trucks can only move within their city. t1 is in c1, so l1_1 is in c1. So drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_1. Then load p1 into t1. Then drive t1 to l1_2 and unload. But why? Because the tenth constraint requires p1 to be in t1 and p2 in l1_2. So perhaps during the plan, after moving p2 to l1_2 (which is in c1), and p1 is loaded into t1, which is in l1_2. So that would satisfy the tenth constraint.

Eleventh constraint: p1 must be in l2_1 at some state. Since p1 starts in l2_5, to get to l2_1 (airport), we need to move it there via truck t2. So that's part of the plan already.

Twelfth constraint: if p1 is in l2_1 in some state s, then in s or after, p2 is in l2_4 or p1 in l1_5. So when p1 is in l2_1 (during transportation), we need to ensure that either p2 is moved to l2_4 or p1 is moved to l1_5. Since p1 is being moved from l2_1 to l1_1 (goal), moving p1 to l1_5 would require a detour. So perhaps p2 is moved to l2_4, which is part of the plan.

Thirteenth constraint: p2 must be in l1_4 (the goal). So that's already covered.

Fourteenth constraint: if p2 is in l1_4, then there must be an earlier state where p2 was in l1_2. So during the plan, after moving p2 to l1_4, we need to have had p2 in l1_2 before. So perhaps p2 is unloaded in l1_1, then loaded into a truck (t1) and driven to l1_2, unloaded, then driven to l1_4. That way, when p2 is in l1_4, the previous step had it in l1_2.

Fifteenth constraint: p2 must be in l1_3 or l1_2 at some state. So during the plan, p2 is in l1_2 (as per the fourteenth constraint) which covers this.

This is getting really complex. Let's try to outline a possible plan step by step, considering all constraints.

Starting with p1 in l2_5 and p2 in l2_2.

First, handle p1:

1. Load p1 into t2 at l2_5. Precondition: p1 and t2 are in l2_5. Yes. So loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5.

2. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_4 (c2). drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2. Now t2 and p1 are in l2_4. Unload p1: unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4. Now p1 is in l2_4. This satisfies the twelfth constraint when p1 is later moved to l2_1, because p2 is moved to l2_4 (but wait, here p1 is in l2_4. Wait, the twelfth constraint says if p1 is in l2_1 (during transportation), then in that state or after, p2 is in l2_4 or p1 in l1_5. So by moving p1 to l2_4 before moving it to l2_1, when p1 is in l2_1 (later), the previous state has p1 in l2_4, but the twelfth constraint requires that in s (when p1 is in l2_1) or after, p2 is in l2_4 or p1 in l1_5. So if p2 is in l2_4 after p1 is in l2_1, that would satisfy it. But perhaps we need to ensure that during the plan, after p1 is loaded into t2 and moved to l2_4, then drive t2 to l2_1, unload p1 there, and then load into airplane a2.

Wait, let's adjust the steps for p1:

1. Load p1 into t2 at l2_5.

2. Drive t2 to l2_4: drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2. Now p1 is in t2 at l2_4.

3. Unload p1 in l2_4: unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4. Now p1 is in l2_4.

4. Then load p1 back into t2 (assuming t2 is still in l2_4): loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4.

5. Drive t2 to l2_1: drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2. Now p1 is in t2 at l2_1.

6. Unload p1: unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1. Now p1 is in l2_1.

7. Load p1 into a2: loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1.

8. Fly a2 to l1_1: flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

9. Unload p1: unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1. Now p1 is in l1_1 (goal).

But during this process:

- When p1 is in l2_4 (step 3), this satisfies the fourth constraint's alternative (if later p2 is in l1_1). Because when p2 is in l1_1 (say after being flown there), the earlier state where p1 was in l2_4 would satisfy the fourth constraint's condition.

But the fourth constraint requires that when p2 is in l1_1 (state s), then in s or after, p1 is in l2_4 or p2 is in l2_3. But in the steps above, after p1 is in l2_4 (step3), it's moved to l2_1 and flown to l1_1. So when p2 is in l1_1 (later), p1 is already in l1_1, so the condition p1 in l2_4 doesn't hold. Therefore, this approach may not satisfy the fourth constraint.

Alternatively, perhaps after moving p1 to l2_4, we need to keep it there until after p2 is in l1_1. But that would require delaying p1's movement, which complicates the plan.

Alternatively, after p2 is in l1_1, move p1 to l2_4. But p1 is in l1_1 (goal), which is in c1, so can't move to l2_4 (c2). So this seems impossible.

This is a problem. Let's think differently. Maybe we need to have p2 in l1_1 (satisfying constraint3) and in the same state or later, p1 is in l2_4. But p1 is being moved to l1_1, so this seems conflicting. Alternatively, maybe p2 is moved to l1_1 after p1 is already in l1_1. But then the fourth constraint requires that in that state or after, p2 is in l2_3 or p1 is in l2_4. But p1 is in l1_1 (goal), so can't be in l2_4. So the only way is to have p2 moved to l2_3 after being in l1_1. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps p2 is loaded into a1 (which is in l1_1) and then flown to l2_3's airport (but l2_3 is not an airport). Airplanes can only land at airports. So l2_1 is the airport in c2. So to get p2 to l2_3, you have to fly to l2_1, then drive. But that's adding steps. This is getting too complicated. Maybe there's a different approach.

Let's consider the constraints one by one and see which ones are automatically satisfied and which need active steps.

Constraint1: p2 in l2_2. Initially true. So satisfied.

Constraint2: when p2 is in l2_2 (initially), then in that state or after, p2 in l2_4 or p1 in l1_5. So we need to ensure that after the initial state, either p2 is moved to l2_4 or p1 is moved to l1_5. Since the goal doesn't require p1 in l1_5, but moving p1 there would require extra steps. So perhaps moving p2 to l2_4 is better. So in the plan, p2 is moved from l2_2 to l2_4. That satisfies constraint2.

Constraint3: p2 in l1_1. This will happen when p2 is flown to l1_1.

Constraint4: when p2 is in l1_1, then in that state or after, p2 in l2_3 or p1 in l2_4. So after p2 is in l1_1, either move p2 to l2_3 (which is in c2) or have p1 in l2_4. But p1's goal is in l1_1, so having p1 in l2_4 would require moving it there and then back, which is not optimal. Alternatively, perhaps p1 is in l2_4 before p2 is in l1_1. Then, when p2 is in l1_1 (state s), the previous state had p1 in l2_4, but the constraint requires that in s or after, p1 is in l2_4 or p2 in l2_3. If p1 was in l2_4 before s, but not during or after s, then the constraint isn't satisfied. So we need p1 to be in l2_4 during or after s. But once p1 is moved to l1_1, it's no longer in l2_4. So this is a problem.

Maybe the solution is to have p1 in l2_4 after p2 is in l1_1. But how? That's impossible because p1 is being moved to l1_1. So the only way is to move p2 to l2_3 after being in l1_1. But that requires:

- After p2 is in l1_1, load it into a1, fly back to l2_1, unload, then drive to l2_3. Then drive back to l2_1, fly to l1_1 again, and then move to l1_4. This is very inefficient and makes the plan longer, but maybe necessary.

Alternatively, perhaps the fourth constraint can be satisfied by having p2 in l1_1 (after being flown there) and then immediately moving it to l2_3. But how? Because l2_3 is in c2, which requires flying back. So steps would be:

- Fly p2 to l1_1 (now in l1_1).

- Load p2 into a1 (which is at l1_1).

- Fly a1 to l2_1 (c2's airport).

- Unload p2 into l2_1.

- Load p2 into truck t2 (if available) and drive to l2_3.

- Then, from l2_3, move p2 back to l2_1, load into a2, fly to l1_1 again, then move to l1_4.

This is very long and not optimal. But given the constraints, it might be necessary.

Alternatively, maybe the fourth constraint can be satisfied by having p1 in l2_4 before p2 is in l1_1. For example:

- Move p1 to l2_4 (using t2), then move to l2_1 and fly to l1_1.

- Then move p2 to l1_1. At this point, p1 is in l1_1, but previously was in l2_4. However, the constraint requires that during or after p2 is in l1_1, p1 is in l2_4. Since p1 was in l2_4 before, but not during or after, this doesn't satisfy the constraint. So this approach won't work.

This seems like a dead end. Perhaps the only way is to have p2 in l2_3 after being in l1_1. Let's try:

Plan for p2:

1. Move p2 from l2_2 to l2_4 using truck t2.

   - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2 (but t2 is in l2_5 initially. So first, drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2.

   - drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2.

   - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2.

   - drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2.

   - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4. Now p2 is in l2_4 (satisfies constraint5).

   Then, move p2 to l2_1:

   - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4.

   - drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2.

   - unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1. Now p2 is in l2_1 (satisfies constraint8).

   Then, load onto a2:

   - loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1.

   Fly to l1_1:

   - flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

   Unload p2: unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1. Now p2 is in l1_1 (satisfies constraint3).

   Now, constraint4 requires that after this, p2 is moved to l2_3 or p1 is in l2_4.

   So, after this, we need to move p2 to l2_3.

   Load p2 into a1 (which is in l1_1):

   - loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1.

   Fly a1 to l2_1:

   - flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1.

   Unload p2 in l2_1.

   Then, load into truck t2 (which is in l2_1):

   - loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.

   Drive to l2_3:

   - drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2.

   Unload p2: unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3. Now p2 is in l2_3 (satisfying constraint4's alternative).

   Then, move p2 back to l2_1, load onto a2, fly to l1_1 again, then move to l1_4.

But this is very long and not optimal. The optimal plan should be the shortest possible. This approach adds many steps, which may not be optimal.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to satisfy constraint4 without moving p2 to l2_3. For example, if p1 is in l2_4 during the state when p2 is in l1_1. But how?

Wait, p1's journey is from l2_5 to l2_4 (via t2), then to l2_1, then flown to l1_1.

So during the step when p1 is in l2_4 (after being unloaded there), then p2 is in l2_4 as well (from earlier steps). Wait, no. If p2 is moved to l2_4 first, then p1 is moved to l2_4 later. Or maybe they are in l2_4 at different times.

But when p2 is in l1_1 (after being flown there), p1 is already in l1_1 (goal), so p1 can't be in l2_4 at the same time. So this won't work.

This is getting too complicated. Let's try to outline a plan step by step, considering all constraints, and see if it works.

Plan outline:

For p1:

1. Load p1 into t2 at l2_5.

2. Drive t2 to l2_4: drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2.

3. Unload p1: unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4. (Now p1 is in l2_4, satisfying the twelfth constraint if needed later.)

4. Load p1 back into t2: loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4.

5. Drive t2 to l2_1: drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2.

6. Unload p1: unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1.

7. Load p1 into a2: loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1.

8. Fly a2 to l1_1: flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

9. Unload p1: unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1. (Now p1 is in l1_1, goal achieved.)

For p2:

10. Load t2 with p2 at l2_2. But t2 is in l2_1 after step5. So need to drive t2 back to l2_2. Wait, t2 was driven to l2_1 in step5. So after step5, t2 is in l2_1. To load p2 which is in l2_2, we need t2 to be in l2_2.

So:

After step5 (t2 is in l2_1), drive t2 to l2_2:

10. drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2.

11. loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2.

12. drive t2 to l2_4: drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2. (This moves p2 to l2_4, satisfying constraint5.)

13. unload p2: unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4.

14. load p2 into t2 again: loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4.

15. drive t2 to l2_1: drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2.

16. unload p2: unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.

17. load p2 into a2: loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1.

18. fly a2 to l1_1: flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

19. unload p2: unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1. (Now p2 is in l1_1, satisfying constraint3.)

But now we need to handle constraint4: after p2 is in l1_1 (step19), in that state or after, p2 must be in l2_3 or p1 in l2_4. But p1 is already in l1_1 (step9). So we need to move p2 to l2_3.

20. load p2 into a1 (which is in l1_1): loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1.

21. fly a1 to l2_1: flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1.

22. unload p2: unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1.

23. load p2 into t2: loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.

24. drive t2 to l2_3: drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2.

25. unload p2: unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3. (Now p2 is in l2_3, satisfying constraint4.)

Now, we need to get p2 back to c1's l1_4. So:

26. load p2 into t2: loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3.

27. drive t2 to l2_1: drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2.

28. unload p2: unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.

29. load p2 into a2: loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1.

30. fly a2 to l1_1: flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

31. unload p2: unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1.

Now, p2 is back in l1_1. To get it to l1_4:

32. load p2 into t1: but t1 is in l1_5. Need to drive t1 to l1_1.

33. drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1.

34. loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

35. drive t1 to l1_4: drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1.

36. unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4. (Goal achieved.)

But this plan is very long, and the user asked for an optimal plan (shortest possible). This approach is not optimal.

Let's think of a different way. Maybe some constraints can be satisfied in a different order.

For example, constraint6 requires p2 in l1_3 or in a1. Suppose during transportation, p2 is loaded into a1. Let's try:

After p2 is in l1_1 (step19), load into a1 (step20: loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1). Now p2 is in a1, satisfying constraint6.

Then fly a1 to l1_1 remains in l1_1? No, a1 is already there. To fly a1 somewhere else, like l2_1? But that would take p2 back to c2. Not helpful.

Alternatively, after loading p2 into a1, fly a1 to l2_1, unload p2 there, then move to l2_3 as before. But again, this adds steps.

Alternatively, after p2 is in a1 (step20), we can satisfy constraint6 and also constraint7 (both p1 and p2 in a1). If p1 is already in l1_1 (step9), load p1 into a1 as well.

So step20: loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1.

Step21: loadairplane p1 a1 l1_1. Now both are in a1, satisfying constraint7.

Then fly a1 to l1_4's airport? No, l1_4 is a regular location. Airplanes can only land at airports. So fly a1 to l1_1 (no movement), unload p2 into a truck to drive to l1_4.

But this way, after step21, both are in a1. Then unload p2:

Step22: unloadairplane p2 a1 l1_1.

Step23: loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1 (assuming t1 is driven to l1_1).

Step24: drive t1 to l1_4.

But this approach may help satisfy multiple constraints.

Let's try to outline this:

After p1 and p2 are in l1_1:

- Load both into a1: steps loadairplane for p1 and p2.

- This satisfies constraint7.

- Then unload p2 and transport to l1_4.

This way, constraint6 is satisfied when p2 is in a1.

But we still need to handle constraint4: after p2 is in l1_1, either p2 is moved to l2_3 or p1 is in l2_4. If we load both into a1 and then fly a1 to l2_1, that might help.

Wait, after loading both into a1, fly a1 to l2_1:

- flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1.

- unload both packages in l2_1.

But this would move p1 back to c2, which contradicts the goal. So not acceptable.

Alternatively, after loading both into a1, keep them there. But the goal requires p1 to be in l1_1 and p2 in l1_4. So this won't work.

This is very challenging. Perhaps the optimal plan requires finding a way to satisfy all constraints without unnecessary steps.

Another angle: the tenth constraint requires p1 in t1 and p2 in l1_2. So at some point, p1 must be loaded into t1, and p2 must be in l1_2.

Since t1 is in c1 (l1_5), to load p1 into t1, p1 must be in c1. So after p1 is flown to l1_1, load into t1.

But t1 is in l1_5. So need to drive t1 to l1_1:

- drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1.

- loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1.

Then drive t1 to l1_2:

- drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1.

- unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2.

But this moves p1 to l1_2, which is not the goal. The goal is l1_1. So this would require moving p1 back. Not optimal.

Alternatively, after p1 is in t1 (loaded in l1_1), keep it there and drive to l1_4:

- drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1.

- unload p1 into l1_4. But the goal is l1_1. So that's not helpful.

This seems like a dead end. The tenth constraint requires p1 in t1 and p2 in l1_2. So perhaps during the plan, after p1 is in t1 (in c1), and p2 is in l1_2 (part of c1), we can satisfy this.

But p2 starts in c2. To get p2 to l1_2, we need to fly it to l1_1, then drive to l1_2. So steps:

- Fly p2 to l1_1.

- Load into t1 (if t1 is in l1_1).

- Drive t1 to l1_2, unload p2 there.

But this would satisfy the tenth constraint when p1 is in t1 (loaded in l1_1) and p2 is in l1_2 (unloaded there). But p1's goal is l1_1, so we can't have it in t1 at the end. So we have to load p1 into t1, drive to l1_2, unload, then move back to l1_1. But that's extra steps.

This is getting too complicated. Given the time constraints, I'll try to draft a plan that addresses as many constraints as possible, even if it's not optimal, then see if I can optimize it.

Here's an attempt:

1. Load p1 into t2 at l2_5: loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5.

2. Drive t2 to l2_4: drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_4 c2. (Now p1 is in l2_4, satisfying constraint12 later.)

3. Unload p1: unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_4.

4. Load p1 back into t2: loadtruck p1 t2 l2_4.

5. Drive t2 to l2_1: drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2.

6. Unload p1: unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1.

7. Load p1 into a2: loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1.

8. Fly a2 to l1_1: flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

9. Unload p1: unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1. (p1 goal achieved.)

For p2:

10. Drive t2 (now in l2_1) to l2_2: drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_2 c2.

11. Load p2 into t2: loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2.

12. Drive t2 to l2_4: drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_4 c2. (p2 in l2_4, constraint5 satisfied.)

13. Unload p2: unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_4.

14. Load p2 into t2: loadtruck p2 t2 l2_4.

15. Drive t2 to l2_1: drivetruck t2 l2_4 l2_1 c2.

16. Unload p2: unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.

17. Load p2 into a2: loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1.

18. Fly a2 to l1_1: flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

19. Unload p2: unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1. (constraint3 satisfied.)

Now, handle constraint4: after p2 is in l1_1 (step19), need p2 in l2_3 or p1 in l2_4.

But p1 is in l1_1 (step9), so need to move p2 to l2_3.

20. Load p2 into a1: loadairplane p2 a1 l1_1.

21. Fly a1 to l2_1: flyairplane a1 l1_1 l2_1.

22. Unload p2: unloadairplane p2 a1 l2_1.

23. Load p2 into t2: loadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.

24. Drive t2 to l2_3: drivetruck t2 l2_1 l2_3 c2.

25. Unload p2: unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_3. (constraint4 satisfied.)

Now, move p2 back to c1's l1_4:

26. Load p2 into t2: loadtruck p2 t2 l2_3.

27. Drive t2 to l2_1: drivetruck t2 l2_3 l2_1 c2.

28. Unload p2: unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1.

29. Load p2 into a2: loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1.

30. Fly a2 to l1_1: flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1.

31. Unload p2: unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1.

Now, transport p2 to l1_4:

32. Drive t1 (in l1_5) to l1_1: drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1.

33. Load p2 into t1: loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1.

34. Drive t1 to l1_4: drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1.

35. Unload p2: unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4. (goal achieved.)

But during this process:

- constraint10 (p1 in t1 and p2 in l1_2) is not addressed. To satisfy this, somewhere in the plan, p1 must be loaded into t1 and p2 must be in l1_2.

Perhaps after step9, load p1 into t1:

36. Load p1 into t1: loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1. (But t1 is at l1_1 after step32, not before. Wait, in step32, t1 is driven to l1_1. So after step32, t1 is in l1_1. So after step32, load p1 into t1, then drive to l1_2.

But p1 is already in l1_1 (unloaded in step9). So to load p1 into t1, it must be in the same location. So after step32 (t1 is in l1_1), load p1 into t1:

36. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_1.

37. drive t1 to l1_2: drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_2 c1.

38. unload p1: unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_2.

But this moves p1 to l1_2, contradicting the goal. So we can't leave it there. So after step38, we need to move p1 back to l1_1:

39. loadtruck p1 t1 l1_2.

40. drivetruck t1 l1_2 l1_1 c1.

41. unloadtruck p1 t1 l1_1.

This adds even more steps. This plan is way too long and not optimal.

Given the time I've spent and the complexity, I think the optimal plan requires cleverly satisfying multiple constraints with minimal steps. For example, using a single airplane trip for both packages, or combining movements.

Another approach: use a1 to transport both packages.

For p1:

1. Load p1 into t2 (l2_5), drive to l2_1, load into a2, fly to l1_1.

For p2:

2. Load p2 into t2 (l2_2), drive to l2_1, load into a2, fly to l1_1.

Then, move p2 to l1_4 via truck.

But this would have both packages in l1_1, satisfying constraint3. Then, p2 is moved to l1_4.

But need to satisfy constraints like p2 being in l2_4, which is not covered here.

Alternatively, during p2's transport, drive through l2_4.

So:

For p2:

1. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2.

2. Load p2.

3. Drive to l2_4 (satisfies constraint5).

4. Then to l2_1.

5. Fly to l1_1.

This way, p2 is in l2_4 during step3.

This handles constraint5.

Then, after p2 is in l1_1 (constraint3), need to handle constraint4.

If during the plan, p1 is in l2_4 (step where p1 is moved through l2_4), then when p2 is in l1_1, p1 was in l2_4 earlier. But the constraint requires that during or after p2 is in l1_1, p1 is in l2_4 or p2 in l2_3. If p1 was in l2_4 before p2 is in l1_1, that doesn't satisfy the constraint. It needs to be during or after.

So perhaps the plan must include p1 being in l2_4 after p2 is in l1_1. But how?

This seems impossible because p1 is moved to l1_1 before p2.

Wait, if p2 is moved first:

1. Move p2 to l2_4, then to l2_1, fly to l1_1.

2. Then move p1.

But p1 starts in l2_5. So:

1. Load p2 into t2, drive to l2_4, unload (constraint5).

2. Load p2 into t2, drive to l2_1, load into a2, fly to l1_1.

3. Now p2 is in l1_1.

4. Move p1: load into t2, drive to l2_4 (satisfies p1 in l2_4 after p2 is in l1_1? No, because p2 is already in l1_1.

But constraint4 says if p2 is in l1_1, then during or after, p1 in l2_4 or p2 in l2_3. So if after p2 is in l1_1, p1 is moved to l2_4, that would satisfy it.

But p1 is in l2_5 initially. To move p1 to l2_4 after p2 is in l1_1:

5. Load p1 into t2 at l2_5.

6. Drive to l2_4, unload.

Now, p1 is in l2_4 (after p2 is in l1_1). This satisfies constraint4.

Then continue moving p1 to l1_1.

But this adds steps. However, it might be necessary.

This is the best I can do given the time. The final answer will be a step-by-step plan considering these steps, but it's possible that I've missed some constraints.
