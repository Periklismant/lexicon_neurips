Let me analyze this problem:

First, there's a potential issue in the initial state description. It says "Package t1", "Package t2", "Package p1", "Package p2", "Package a1", "Package a2" - but based on the object definitions, t1 and t2 are trucks, a1 and a2 are airplanes. There appears to be a mistake in the initial state description, but I'll interpret it as:

- Truck t1 is in location l1_5
- Truck t2 is in location l2_5
- Package p1 is in location l2_5
- Package p2 is in location l2_2
- Airplane a1 is in location l1_1
- Airplane a2 is in location l2_1

The goal is to:
- Package p1 should be in location l1_1
- Package p2 should be in location l1_4

Let's plan this out:

For p1 to go from l2_5 to l1_1:
1. We need to load p1 into a truck in l2_5 (truck t2 is already there)
2. Drive t2 to the airport l2_1
3. Unload p1 at l2_1
4. Load p1 into an airplane at l2_1 (airplane a2 is already there)
5. Fly a2 to l1_1
6. Unload p1 at l1_1

For p2 to go from l2_2 to l1_4:
1. We need to get a truck to l2_2 (truck t2 is in l2_5)
2. Drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2
3. Load p2 into t2 at l2_2
4. Drive t2 to the airport l2_1
5. Unload p2 at l2_1
6. Load p2 into an airplane at l2_1 (airplane a2 is already there)
7. Fly a2 to l1_1
8. Unload p2 at l1_1
9. We need to get a truck to l1_1 (truck t1 is in l1_5)
10. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_1
11. Load p2 into t1 at l1_1
12. Drive t1 to l1_4
13. Unload p2 at l1_4

But there's an issue: I'm trying to use airplane a2 for both packages in a sequence, but if I've transported p1 to l1_1, I'd need to fly a2 back to l2_1 to get p2. I could also use a1 for one of the packages. Let me reevaluate.

Option 1: Use a2 for both packages, but fly back to l2_1 after dropping p1:
1. Load p1 into t2 at l2_5
2. Drive t2 to l2_1
3. Unload p1 at l2_1
4. Load p1 into a2 at l2_1
5. Fly a2 to l1_1
6. Unload p1 at l1_1 (Goal 1 achieved)
7. Fly a2 back to l2_1
8. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2
9. Load p2 into t2 at l2_2
10. Drive t2 to l2_1
11. Unload p2 at l2_1
12. Load p2 into a2 at l2_1
13. Fly a2 to l1_1
14. Unload p2 at l1_1
15. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_1
16. Load p2 into t1 at l1_1
17. Drive t1 to l1_4
18. Unload p2 at l1_4 (Goal 2 achieved)

Option 2: Use both a1 and a2, one for each package:
1. Load p1 into t2 at l2_5
2. Drive t2 to l2_1
3. Unload p1 at l2_1
4. Load p1 into a2 at l2_1
5. Fly a2 to l1_1
6. Unload p1 at l1_1 (Goal 1 achieved)
7. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2
8. Load p2 into t2 at l2_2
9. Drive t2 to l2_1
10. Unload p2 at l2_1
11. Load p2 into a2 at l2_1
12. Fly a2 to l1_1
13. Unload p2 at l1_1
14. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_1
15. Load p2 into t1 at l1_1
16. Drive t1 to l1_4
17. Unload p2 at l1_4 (Goal 2 achieved)

Option 2 seems to be a bit more efficient. Let me optimize and write out the exact plan.

On second thought, Option 1 and Option 2 are essentially the same after step 6. I can go with Option 2, and I don't need to fly a2 back to l2_1 like in Option 1, because a2 is already at l2_1 after flying p1 to l1_1.

Actually, I think I'm still confused. Let me clarify the plan step by step.

First, we have p1 at l2_5 and p2 at l2_2. Our goal is to get p1 to l1_1 and p2 to l1_4.

For p1:
1. We have t2 at l2_5 and p1 at l2_5, so we can load p1 into t2.
2. Drive t2 to the airport l2_1.
3. Unload p1 at l2_1.
4. Load p1 into a2 (which is at l2_1).
5. Fly a2 to l1_1.
6. Unload p1 at l1_1. (Goal 1 achieved)

For p2:
7. Fly a2 back to l2_1.
8. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2.
9. Load p2 into t2 at l2_2.
10. Drive t2 back to l2_1.
11. Unload p2 at l2_1.
12. Load p2 into a2 at l2_1.
13. Fly a2 to l1_1.
14. Unload p2 at l1_1.
15. We need a truck at l1_1 to transport p2 to l1_4. t1 is at l1_5.
16. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_1.
17. Load p2 into t1 at l1_1.
18. Drive t1 to l1_4.
19. Unload p2 at l1_4. (Goal 2 achieved)

But we can also use a1 (which is already at l1_1) for the final steps of p2's journey, to avoid driving t1 from l1_5 to l1_1:

After step 14, we would:
15a. Load p2 into a1 at l1_1.
16a. Fly a1 to l1_1 (it's already there, so this step is redundant).
17a. Unload p2 at l1_1.
18a. Drive t1, which is already at l1_5, to l1_4.
19a. Drive t1 from l1_4 to l1_1.
20a. Load p2 into t1 at l1_1.
21a. Drive t1 to l1_4.
22a. Unload p2 at l1_4. (Goal 2 achieved)

This doesn't seem to be more efficient. But I realized that a1 doesn't need to fly. t1 can directly drive from l1_5 to l1_1, pick up p2, and then drive to l1_4. This is the most efficient for the final part of the plan.

Actually, I've been overthinking this. Here's a cleaner version:

For p1 (from l2_5 to l1_1):
1. Load p1 into t2 at l2_5.
2. Drive t2 to l2_1.
3. Unload p1 at l2_1.
4. Load p1 into a2 at l2_1.
5. Fly a2 to l1_1.
6. Unload p1 at l1_1. (Goal 1 achieved)

For p2 (from l2_2 to l1_4):
7. We need to get t2 to l2_2.
8. Drive t2 from l2_1 to l2_2.
9. Load p2 into t2 at l2_2.
10. Drive t2 back to l2_1.
11. Unload p2 at l2_1.
12. Load p2 into a2 at l1_1 (need to fly a2 back to l2_1 first).
13. Fly a2 from l1_1 to l2_1.
14. Load p2 into a2 at l2_1.
15. Fly a2 to l1_1.
16. Unload p2 at l1_1.
17. Load p2 into t1 at l1_1 (need to drive t1 to l1_1 first).
18. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_1.
19. Load p2 into t1 at l1_1.
20. Drive t1 to l1_4.
21. Unload p2 at l1_4. (Goal 2 achieved)

I think I'm being inefficient because I'm bouncing between the two tasks. I'll now focus on a step-by-step optimal plan:

1. Load p1 into t2 at l2_5.
2. Drive t2 to l2_2 to pick up p2.
3. Load p2 into t2 at l2_2.
4. Drive t2 to l2_1.
5. Unload p1 at l2_1.
6. Load p1 into a2 at l2_1.
7. Unload p2 at l2_1.
8. Fly a2 to l1_1.
9. Unload p1 at l1_1. (Goal 1 achieved for p1)
10. Fly a2 back to l2_1.
11. Load p2 into a2 at l2_1.
12. Fly a2 to l1_1.
13. Unload p2 at l1_1.
14. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_1.
15. Load p2 into t1 at l1_1.
16. Drive t1 to l1_4.
17. Unload p2 at l1_4. (Goal 2 achieved for p2)

Hmm, but this is not optimal. I'm using a2 to transport both packages, which requires it to fly back and forth. I could use both a1 and a2 to transport the packages, which might be more efficient. But perhaps the most efficient would be using a1 for p2 and a2 for p1, since they're already positioned at their respective airports.

Let's try this:

1. We have p1 at l2_5 and p2 at l2_2. t2 is at l2_5.
2. Load p1 into t2 at l2_5.
3. Drive t2 to l2_2.
4. Load p2 into t2 at l2_2.
5. Drive t2 to l2_1.
6. Unload p1 at l2_1.
7. Load p1 into a2 at l2_1.
8. Unload p2 at l2_1.
9. Load p2 into a2 at l2_1.
10. Fly a2 to l1_1.
11. Unload p1 at l1_1. (Goal 1 achieved)
12. Unload p2 at l1_1.
13. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_1.
14. Load p2 into t1 at l1_1.
15. Drive t1 to l1_4.
16. Unload p2 at l1_4. (Goal 2 achieved)

Wait, I can optimize even further. Why load and unload p2 at l2_1 when we can just keep it in the truck t2? a2 can carry both p1 and p2 in one go:

1. We have p1 at l2_5 and p2 at l2_2. t2 is at l2_5.
2. Load p1 into t2 at l2_5.
3. Drive t2 to l2_2.
4. Load p2 into t2 at l2_2.
5. Drive t2 to l2_1.
6. Unload p1 at l2_1.
7. Load p1 into a2 at l2_1.
8. Unload p2 at l2_1.
9. Load p2 into a2 at l2_1.
10. Fly a2 to l1_1.
11. Unload p1 at l1_1. (Goal 1 achieved)
12. Unload p2 at l1_1.
13. Drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_1.
14. Load p2 into t1 at l1_1.
15. Drive t1 to l1_4.
16. Unload p2 at l1_4. (Goal 2 achieved)

Alright, this is the most efficient plan I can come up with. I'll now formalize it using the exact action syntax specified in the problem.

Actually, I just realized I'm repeating the same thought. Let me recheck the initial state to be sure I'm interpreting everything correctly.

According to the object definitions, t1 and t2 are trucks, a1 and a2 are airplanes, and p1 and p2 are packages. The initial state says:

"Package t1 is in location l1_5"
"Package t2 is in location l2_5"
"Package p1 is in location l2_5"
"Package p2 is in location l2_2"
"Package a1 is in location l1_1"
"Package a2 is in location l2_1"

This is incorrect, as t1, t2, a1, and a2 aren't packages. I'll interpret this as:

"Truck t1 is in location l1_5"
"Truck t2 is in location l2_5"
"Package p1 is in location l2_5"
"Package p2 is in location l2_2"
"Airplane a1 is in location l1_1"
"Airplane a2 is in location l2_1"

Given this, my plan would be:

1. `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5`
2. `drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2`
3. `loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2`
4. `drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2`
5. `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1`
6. `loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1`
7. `unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1`
8. `loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1`
9. `flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1`
10. `unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1`  (Goal 1 achieved)
11. `unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1`
12. `drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1`
13. `loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1`
14. `drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1`
15. `unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4`  (Goal 2 achieved)

This is a 15-step plan that achieves the goal of having p1 at l1_1 and p2 at l1_4. I've been thorough in my analysis and am confident this is the optimal solution.

Actually, I've noticed a discrepancy. I'm using the action `unloadairplane` but in the problem description, it's mentioned as `loadairplane` twice for both loading and unloading. This seems like a mistake in the problem statement. I'll use `unloadairplane` as I believe is the correct syntax. 

Wait, I've noticed another discrepancy in the problem statement. Under "The actions of this domain have the following effects:", the second `loadairplane` is probably intended to be `unloadairplane`. I'll use `unloadairplane` for the unloading action.

Let me verify that the plan is consistent with the action descriptions:

1. `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5`: p1 and t2 are both at l2_5, so we can load p1 into t2.
2. `drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2`: t2 is at l2_5, and both l2_5 and l2_2 are in city c2, so we can drive t2 from l2_5 to l2_2.
3. `loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2`: p2 is at l2_2 and t2 is now at l2_2 (after step 2), so we can load p2 into t2.
4. `drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2`: t2 is at l2_2, and both l2_2 and l2_1 are in city c2, so we can drive t2 from l2_2 to l2_1.
5. `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1`: t2 is at l2_1 (after step 4) and p1 is in t2 (after step 1), so we can unload p1 from t2 at l2_1.
6. `loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1`: p1 is at l2_1 (after step 5) and a2 is at l2_1, so we can load p1 into a2.
7. `unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1`: t2 is at l2_1 (after step 4) and p2 is in t2 (after step 3), so we can unload p2 from t2 at l2_1.
8. `loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1`: p2 is at l2_1 (after step 7) and a2 is at l2_1, so we can load p2 into a2.
9. `flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1`: a2 is at l2_1, so we can fly a2 from l2_1 to l1_1.
10. `unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1`: a2 is at l1_1 (after step 9) and p1 is in a2 (after step 6), so we can unload p1 from a2 at l1_1.
11. `unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1`: a2 is at l1_1 (after step 9) and p2 is in a2 (after step 8), so we can unload p2 from a2 at l1_1.
12. `drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1`: t1 is at l1_5 and both l1_5 and l1_1 are in city c1, so we can drive t1 from l1_5 to l1_1.
13. `loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1`: p2 is at l1_1 (after step 11) and t1 is at l1_1 (after step 12), so we can load p2 into t1.
14. `drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1`: t1 is at l1_1 (after step 12) and both l1_1 and l1_4 are in city c1, so we can drive t1 from l1_1 to l1_4.
15. `unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4`: t1 is at l1_4 (after step 14) and p2 is in t1 (after step 13), so we can unload p2 from t1 at l1_4.

So this is the optimal plan with 15 steps. It satisfies the goal of having p1 at l1_1 and p2 at l1_4.

Actually, let me double check the domain actions because I'm still unsure about `unloadairplane`. The problem statement mentions:

"loadairplane p ap l": Load package p in airplane ap. Both p and ap are in location l.
"loadairplane p ap l": Unload package p from airplane ap in location l.

This is clearly a mistake, but I want to be sure. The effects description says:

"loadairplane": After loading a package p in an airplane ap at location l, (i) p is no longer situated in l, and (ii) p is in ap.
"unloadairplane": After unloading a package p from an airplane ap in a location l, (i) p is no longer in ap, and (ii) p is situated in l.

This confirms that there's a mistake in the domain action description, and the unloading action should be `unloadairplane`. I'll proceed with the plan I provided earlier, with `unloadairplane` for unloading from airplanes.

Actually, there's one more thing I want to consider here. Every single step adds to the total cost of this solution, so I want to make sure my plan is absolutely optimal:

1. `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5`
2. `drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2`
3. `loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2`
4. `drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2`
5. `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1`
6. `loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1`
7. `unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1`
8. `loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1`
9. `flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1`
10. `unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1`  (Goal 1 achieved)
11. `unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1`
12. `drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1`
13. `loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1`
14. `drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1`
15. `unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4`  (Goal 2 achieved)

I think this is the most efficient plan for getting both packages to their destinations. The key insight is transporting both packages in a2 simultaneously, which saves us a trip.

Let me make sure one last time that I'm not missing anything...

Actually, in the interest of being thorough, let me consider the possibility of using a1 instead of a2 for part of the transportation:

a1 is initially at l1_1. We could fly a1 to l2_1 to pick up p1 and p2, and then fly back to l1_1. But this would require an extra flight step compared to just using a2, which is already at l2_1.

Another possibility is using a1 to transport p2 from l1_1 to l1_4, but I don't think airplanes can land at locations that aren't airports. l1_1 is an airport, but l1_4 likely isn't, since the problem states "One location of each city is an airport." So we'd need a truck for the final leg of p2's journey anyway.

Given these considerations, I'm confident that the plan I outlined is indeed the optimal solution. Here it is again:

1. `loadtruck p1 t2 l2_5`
2. `drivetruck t2 l2_5 l2_2 c2`
3. `loadtruck p2 t2 l2_2`
4. `drivetruck t2 l2_2 l2_1 c2`
5. `unloadtruck p1 t2 l2_1`
6. `loadairplane p1 a2 l2_1`
7. `unloadtruck p2 t2 l2_1`
8. `loadairplane p2 a2 l2_1`
9. `flyairplane a2 l2_1 l1_1`
10. `unloadairplane p1 a2 l1_1`  (Goal 1 achieved)
11. `unloadairplane p2 a2 l1_1`
12. `drivetruck t1 l1_5 l1_1 c1`
13. `loadtruck p2 t1 l1_1`
14. `drivetruck t1 l1_1 l1_4 c1`
15. `unloadtruck p2 t1 l1_4`  (Goal 2 achieved)

One more time, just to make sure, let's check that the action syntax is correct:

- `loadtruck p t l`: Correct.
- `loadairplane p ap l`: Correct.
- `unloadtruck p t l`: Correct.
- `unloadairplane p ap l`: The problem statement has a typo (it says `loadairplane` twice), but given the context and the effects description, this seems to be the correct syntax.
- `drivetruck t l_from l_to c`: Correct.
- `flyairplane ap l_from l_to`: Correct.

So, I believe this is the optimal plan with the correct syntax.
